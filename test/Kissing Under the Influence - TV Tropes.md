Zoe welcoming the habby new beer with a kiss. \*Hic\*

Two characters kiss due to the influence of mind-altering Applied Phlebotinum — or just plain ol' mind-altering substances like alcohol — to which one (or possibly both) of them have been exposed. The kiss may be directly caused by scientific or magical means, or be the eventual result from some kind of love spell. In one-sided cases, even though the unaffected participant is hardly — if ever — the one who cast the spell, he or she doesn't object.

This affliction usually strikes characters (a) who would never kiss when they're both sane, (b) whom fans have been dying to see kiss for many a season or both. The trope's potential lies in the fact that the couple's shippers can Squee, and everyone else can brush it off with, "It wasn't real."

See also Intoxication Ensues and Alcohol-Induced Idiocy. If it doesn't stop with just the kiss, it's Aliens Made Them Do It. If one of them Defies this trope and refuses to take advantage, they're Above the Influence.

Not to be confused with But Liquor Is Quicker or Slipping a Mickey, which are done very deliberately to Invoke this trope.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Kusuri attempts this twice in her introductory arc, but fails both times. The first time, she serves Rentarou tea spiked with a Love Potion to get him to accept her confession, but he tries to regurgitate the drug when he finds out, and she has to administer a neutralizer when his body becomes overwhelmed by the drug. The second time, she drugs a thermos to get Rentarou to make out with her, but everyone thinks the thermos is for the girls, and the drug turns them into kissing zombies.
-   It goes a lot further than kissing in _Corsair_ when Canale is drugged with a powerful aphrodisiac and Ayace first saves him from the person who drugged him and then decides to take advantage himself, despite never showing any interest in him before. Being a BL manga though, the relationship continues even after Ayace can no longer use the aphrodisiac as an excuse.
-   The Girls' Love Manga, _Girl Friends (2006)_ uses this. The central couple gets their first kiss when Mari drunkenly kisses a drunkenly passed out Akko. Also their two female friends, Sugi and Tamamin sometimes make out when drunk.
-   Sano from _Hana-Kimi_ kisses anyone near him when he's drunk. Cue Ho Yay moments.
-   In the _High School Of The Dead_ OVA special, the gang is under the influence of the funky smoke. Saeko and Rei wound up frenching each other on the beach with each thinking the other was Takashi. Though after they've recovered, they agree to never speak of it again.
-   _Kill la Kill_: After being brainwashed by having Junketsu sewed onto Ryuko's skin by Ragyo and Nui, Ryuko ends up kissing Nui before battling Satsuki. Nui then mentions that Ryuko is better than Ragyo at kissing. It's played entirely for Fan Disservice due to them technically all being family members and Nui being the killer of Ryuko's father.
-   Houin ("horny drunk") kissing a passed-out Aoki in the _Kodomo no Jikan_ manga.
-   In one of _Kyo Kara Maoh!_'s OVAs, a possessed-by-Shinou Wolfram kidnaps Yuuri from his bed and forces them to kiss. The fact that Yuuri is conscious, awfully confused, and _bound_ makes this scene that much funnier.
-   _Living Game_: Izumi and Raizo finally break through the sexual tension after some late-night boozing at the corporate party.
-   _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_ had an episode where Lucia was in possession of a mood-altering device that took control of her and made her kiss Kaito, then pass out. In the corresponding manga chapter, she wasn't misusing Applied Phlebotinum, she was just drunk, from ''cola''!
-   _Moyashimon_ has the unforgettable episode where Hazuki Oikawa and Aoi Muto take aphrodisiacs. They think it has no effect on them... But their thoughts might be different the following morning. Sado-Masochist Hasegawa has a somewhat different reaction (though admittedly she also had alcohol, as did the other two in the manga).
-   _Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water_: Happens between the two teenage leads, thanks to an Intoxication Ensues situation with a handful of mushrooms. It doesn't help resolve the Will They or Won't They? situation — the next morning, only one of them remembers it.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has a rather interesting example in which Nodoka asks Negi for a kiss... while they're in an area filled with the power of The World Tree. The magic turns Negi into a Determinator who _will_ get a kiss from somebody. He ends up kissing Asuna, almost suffocating her in the process, and goes back to normal afterwards with no memory of the event. Asuna swears everyone who saw the incident to silence.
-   In the _Ouran High School Host Club_ manga, Tamaki kisses Haruhi while delirious with a fever, and this is when she realizes that she has feelings for him. It psychs her out tremendously, and she is very frustrated when she realizes that she can't bust his chops about it since he doesn't even remember in the incident.
-   Ai's First Kiss with Mew in _Psychic Academy_ after they had drunken an apparently alcoholic 'energy drink' touted by Ai's brother.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   In an early chapter/episode, Ranma's "Cat-fu" is revealed to be calmed by laying on Akane's lap, purring like a cat. The first time this happens he gives her a little kiss on the cheek (acting like an affectionate cat). Embarrassed, she gives him the Megaton Punch.
    -   Once, after being snagged by a Fishing Rod of Love, Ranma fell under a spell that made him fall in love with Ryōga. As a girl, Ranma would then kiss him lovingly on the cheek — Ryōga's reaction was less than pretty.
-   Usagi's First Kiss in _Sailor Moon_ was under the influence. Which can leave a bitter taste in one's mouth towards Mamoru's action in taking advantage of her. It left a bitter taste in _Mamoru's_ mouth when, after a First Kiss\-themed episode of the original anime, they were discussing theirs, and he realised he was remembering an earlier occasion than she was.
-   In the second season of _Strike Witches_, Mio kisses Minna (presumably with tongue, if the sound she made while doing so is anything to go by) after getting plastered from a huge jug of wine. Not exactly how we expected it would go from a Beach Episode.
-   Subverted in a chapter of _To Love Ru_ where Yami, under the effect of Celine's pollen nearly kiss Rito that stop her before the effect disappear.
-   In _The Vision of Escaflowne_, Dornkirk uses magic with the help of Eria and Folken roleplaying to manipulate Allen Shezar, Van's rival, into kissing Hitomi. This was done to purposely drive a wedge between Hitomi and Van and keep them apart in order to change fate.

They apparently had sex after Parker had one too many at his Aunt May's wedding. It's later explained that, as a gag, Michelle kept filling his glass with cider when Peter wasn't looking, so he thought it was wine.

-   _HERZ_: In the backstory, Kurumi kissed Shinji when he was heavily inebriated and then the got her way with him. She hoped that action led to them becoming a couple, but it backfired horribly: Shinji kept loving Asuka and he was so ashamed of what happened he started to actively avoid Kurumi.

-   _LadyBugOut_ opens with the aftermath of one such incident. Oblivio wiped out Ladybug and Chat Noir's memories, and the two kissed before they were restored... much to Chat Noir's delight and Ladybug's horror.

Their tongues and minds entwined, and Scott found himself running his hands through her wild red hair. Jean's hands were all over him. The next thing Scott knew, they were on the ground with Jean on top of him. She looked like some pagan goddess, looking down at him with passion-bruised lips and her hair all mussed.
    
-   A variation in _You Call That a Costume?_: while transformed into a vampire bat and werewolf due to a Becoming the Costume spell, Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash act like a pair of mating animals.

-   In the _Ciaphas Cain_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  series (specifically _For The Emperor_ and the short story "Sector 13"), Tyranid Genestealers are implied to force this upon their victims. Genestealers spread The Virus to create "cults" of apparently loyal humans who will turn to the Tyranid side as soon as the hive fleet arrives in the system (or whenever would best suit their needs). To do so, they abduct and attack humans, then implant them with an organelle that lodges in their chest cavity. The main function of the organelle is to gradually infect the victims' children, who are also born with Genestealer implants. As the generations pass, mutations grow more extreme until eventually, they birth a combination of nearly-normal humans (for infiltration) and Genestealer Purestrains, which are vicious close-combat specialists that protect the cult and look nothing like humans. To ensure the hosts _have_ children, the implants subtly encourage them to form attachments and have sex at every opportunity, especially (but not necessarily) with other hybrids.

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ did this one a few times...
    -   "Band Candy": Under the influence of a spell that makes adults act like teenagers, Giles and Joyce listen to sixties music, smoke, rob a store, and oh yeah, have sex (though the last isn't confirmed for several more episodes). They're awkward around each other afterwards and apparently eventually decide That Didn't Happen; however, apparently the memory was a fond one for Giles because when Joyce dies he can be seen mournfully listening to the same records.
    -   "Something Blue": Due to a botched spell by Willow, Buffy plans a marriage with Spike; the two act like lovebirds for the majority of the episode.
    -   "Tabula Rasa": Their memories wiped, Anya and Giles believe themselves engaged; the spell wears off during a sweeping dip kiss.
    -   "Once More With Feeling": A second case of Buffy and Spike Kissing Under the Influence... sort of. (subverted because the demon causing the singing and dancing had left by then; subverted again when, a couple of episodes later, they begin a sexual relationship.)

They leave it there for now, but their mutual attraction is now out in the open.

-   _Scrubs_:
    -   It has a kiss between J.D. and Carla in season 4. Both were drunk and the morning after exchange was hilarious:

    **Naomi:** Oh... _(her denial catches up with her libido)_ It's only the drugs, right?  
    **Emily:** ...sure.  
    _(The two start to make out like crazy.)_
    
-   _Sliders_: Maggie and every man she can get her hands on after being implanted with an alien egg intent on propagating.
-   _Smallville_:
    -   Seriously, Chloe and Clark kissed more times under the influence than not, although notably every time it is just making Chloe show her hidden feelings.
        -   _Hug_: To prove his mind control powers, the meteor-freak of the week makes Chloe kiss Clark.
        -   _Rush_: An adrenaline-inducing parasite infects Chloe, leading to some heavy making out with Clark who is affected by red kryptonite, and would certainly have gone further if she didn't remove his shirt and the red kryptonite in it.
        -   _Devoted_: A love potion makes Chloe wait at the loft wearing nothing but his football jersey. Three guesses what happened.
    -   Also, every single episode that involves Red Kryptonite. Thankfully, almost everyone Clark kisses suffers Easy Amnesia when the phlebotinum wears off. This sometimes reaches ludicrous levels — Why did red kryptonite lipstick erase Lois's memory when it wore off? If it didn't, the writers would have to use Character Development.
    -   Later, Maxima and Zatanna used Psychic Powers and magic, respectively, to force Clark to kiss them.
    -   _Shield_: After Hawkman gets drunk, he hallucinates his dead wife standing before him. Overwhelmed, he rushes up and kisses her, then it turns out he snogged Lois. Outraged and not realizing what he's going through, Lois slaps him.
        -   Emil and Tess, on the other hand, is not as subtle.
-   _Stargate SG-1_: Sam kisses Jack in "The Broca Divide" after turning into a cavewoman. Every male character who kisses Hathor is under the influence of her weird breath. It happens more than just these times...
-   _Stargate Atlantis_, where in one episode Rodney and a female soldier share Rodney's body between them. First, she advances Rodney's social life by taking control of his body and kissing the woman he has a crush on. Then, at the end of the episode, she takes control again, but this time to kiss the _man_ that _she_ has a crush on, before undergoing the risky reversal procedure. This last caused squee overload for slash fans because onscreen it's just two guys kissing.
    -   Sheppard from _Stargate Atlantis_ gets to kiss both female leads like this. The first time he kisses Teyla because he is losing his inhibitions due to transformation into a bug. Then while the two are acting as hosts to alien consciousnesses 'Elizabeth' kisses 'John'. Then she tries to murder him.
-   In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Plato's Stepchildren", sadistic and bored aliens with psychokinetic powers, which allow them to control people's movements, force Kirk and Uhura, as well as Spock and Nurse Chapel, to kiss for their amusement, leading to the first black/white interracial kiss on American TV.
-   In the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "The Naked Now", Data and Lt. Tasha Yar have sex while under the influence of the same alcoholic intoxication disease that inflicted the _TOS_ crew in "The Naked Time". After they were cured, Tasha told Data that the whole thing never happened. In later seasons, Data is shown to treasure the memory, especially after Tasha's death.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_:
    -   Kes almost provides what would have been the show's only lesbian kiss when she is possessed by an evil alien dictator in "Warlord".
    -   In "Blood Fever", when Vorick goes through his _pon farr_, he forms a brief telepathic mind-meld with B'Elanna (before getting his jaw broken) who then becomes consumed with lust for Tom Paris. Paris proves to be Above the Influence, but the incident nevertheless foreshadows later developments.
    -   In "Scientific Method", B'Elanna and Tom hook up for real and start Making Love in All the Wrong Places, earning a formal reprimand from the captain. In that episode, aliens are discovered doing secret medical experiments on the crew, and they wonder if their sex-mad behaviour, perhaps even their entire relationship, might be a result of some aliens messing with their hormones as an experiment. Well, it's a good thing they found out in time, Tom and B'Elanna conclude while snogging passionately.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ has a lesbian kiss in the episode "Rejoined" involving Dax and another Trill. The "influence" in this case is that both parties are remembering a previous life in which they were a heterosexual couple.
-   The "alien orgasm monster" from the _Torchwood_ episode "Day One".
-   In the _Farscape_ episode "Meltdown", Crichton and Aeryn are affected by fluids from Talyn that make them consumed with mutual lust. In one amusing scene they have to snog, frantically complete some essential repairs, then gratefully go back to snogging again (this example is actually playing with the concept, as John and Aeryn were _already_ in an intimate relationship during this episode. Talyn's fluids just ramped them up into overdrive). Likewise, an alien infiltrator increases everyone's emotions prior to draining them in "Twice Shy". Chiana's already considerable sex drive is increased, leading to her kissing the (female) alien, cornering and attempting to flirt with Aeryn, and trying to forcefully 'recreate' with John Crichton on a table.
-   Elena's younger brother Jeremy from _The Vampire Diaries_ did a lot more than just kiss his crush when they were both high over the summer.

    Puppet Shows 

-   A one-sided example occurs in _Fraggle Rock_ when Wembley makes friends with a girl Fraggle named Lou. Mokey, convinced that Wembley is in love, takes him to the Trash Heap to ask how to make sure Lou returns the sentiment. The Trash Heap gives Wembley a bottle of Love Potion #9 to use on Lou. Unfortunately, it spills into the pond, producing a gas that everyone in the Great Hall inhales. Boober, after falling under the influence of the love potion, starts smothering Wembley with kisses. Wembley, the only one not under the potion's spell, is not in the least inclined to kiss Boober back. Fortunately, the potion works for only twenty minutes.

    Theatre 

-   In _Peter Pan Goes Wrong_, Annie starts kissing Jonathan while she is still woozy from being electrocuted. Jonathan responds rather enthusiastically.

    Video Games 

-   In _Blazing Dragons_, Flicker reflects a hypnotic spell onto Trivet, putting him into a trance where he believes he's really Princess Flame. When Sir Loungealot comes in to check on "her", Trivet tells him to stop stalling and get to "some action". Loungealot _happily_ obliges with a big kiss, only for the hypnotism to wear off right then.
-   Hilariously averted in _Granblue Fantasy_, Lamretta almost pulls this on the protagonist after getting particularly wasted in the Fate Episode of her R version, but her gut kills the mood.
-   Mentioned in _Octopath Traveler II_. During part of Castti's Chapter 2, Partitio mentions that he can't remember what happened last night because he drank too much. Castti proceeds to troll him by implying that they got up to some rather naughty shenanigans, much to his shock.

    Visual Novels

-   Used with three different love interests in _Melody_:
    -   Melody's "evening kiss" that she she gives the protagonist as a "reward" (provided that the player previously made certain choices) takes place after the two of them share a bottle of wine over dinner.
    -   On Becca's romantic path, Becca invites the protagonist to dinner at her apartment, and he brings a bottle of wine. If he answers Becca's questions in certain ways, she will kiss him goodbye for the night.
    -   The protagonist's first kiss with Amy (at least if Melody isn't there) happens outside her hotel room, after they both drank at her birthday dinner.

    Webcomics 

-   _Achewood_: "Man, chicks will do anything on Cuervo! They'll even lez out!"
-   Narrowly averted and played with in _Misfile_ when Ash and Vashiel both believe they did a lot more than kiss. It turned out they just got so blitzed that they passed out and were put in the same bed to make it easier to keep an eye on them.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Elliot kisses Carol on the cheek while under the influence of the personality altering aspects of his "Cheerleadra" spell.
-   Cloudcuckoolander Izm and his friend A.E.D made out when they were drunk. Of course, this being _Hedone High_, it was never mentioned again.
-   _Homestuck_:
-   Steve and Mark in the opening arc of _Khaos Komix_. And then some.
-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Belkar kisses Vaarsuvius full on the lips after drinking 10 mugs of beer in 10 seconds. The one witness is sworn to silence.
-   Happens in _Rain_ between Fara and Heather, Heather and Jessica, and a one-sided version between Rudy (drunk) and Rain (sober).
-   In an early _Sluggy Freelance_ strip, Zoe got drunk at a New Year's party and kisses a guy she's too drunk to recognize as Torg. Made doubly awkward since Zoe says "You're not like those jerks Torg and Riff" before kissing him.
-   _Sticky Dilly Buns_: Booze leads Jerzy to bad decisions regarding Angel here. Angel's exploitation of the situation verges on But Liquor Is Quicker territory.
-   _Tripping Over You_: Downplayed when Milo mistakenly believes his crush Liam has started dating someone else, drowns his sorrows with a few drinks, and then makes a Love Confession when he learns the truth. It gets him a Kiss-Kiss-Slap in the short term, but a Relationship Upgrade in the long run.
    
    **Milo:** I'm just... I... _like_ you.  
    **Liam:** That- that wasn't _pop_ you were drinking, was it? _(Milo kisses him)_
    
-   Implied to have happened numerous times in _xkcd_

    Web Videos 

-   The Tobuscus video "How to Get Women" is a parody of Axe deodorant commercials in which Toby, upon donning Axe body spray, is constantly assaulted by women attempting to make out with him. This wrecks his life and drives him into therapy, but he refuses to give up the Axe.

    Western Animation 

-   Happened in _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_ episode "League of Villains" where Jimmy distracts the villains by exposing Beautiful Gorgeous and the Junkman to a love potion, causing a large amount of Squick from both sides.
-   In an episode of _American Dad!_, Roger and Francine attend a wine tasting together and end up kissing while drunk. Roger worries that this will destroy his newfound friendship with Stan, so he tries to engineer a similar situation with Stan and a random woman he claims is his girlfriend so they'll be even. Of course, Roger ends up destroying the friendship anyway by resorting to extreme measures to keep Stan from finding out.
-   _Bob's Burgers_: In "Dr. Yap", Linda's sister Gayle becomes infatuated with Bob after Bob kisses her, mistaking her for Linda while he's recovering from his dentist's anesthetics.
-   Happens a few times in _The Fairly Oddparents_.
    -   Timmy uses The Dark Side suit for this purpose on Trixie in "The End of the Universe-ity". He also tries in "Genie, Meanie, Miney, Moe", but it's though Norm. "You Doo" is a debatable example, while the dolls could control actions, there was no evidence it could change personality. A variation occurs in "Love Struck!" when Timmy puts a spell on himself so he can date Tootie.
    -   The chapter book _Token Wishes_ also has Tootie using one of Timmy's wish tokens to make him kiss her.
-   In an episode of _Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures_ Jonny and Jessie get possessed by the ghosts of two lovers who murdered each other over a jealous spat. Hadji and another character convince the spirits to literally kiss and make up... while still in Jonny and Jessie's bodies. There's a brief awkward moment between the two after (the fact that they failed to notice the ghosts had left them for several seconds probably didn't help) but it passes fairly quickly. Jessie even teases Jonny about it later in the episode.
-   _Kim Possible_ in its most memorable episode, "Emotion Sickness":
    -   A mood-controlling chip (the Moodulator) attaches to Kim and gets inadvertently switched to "Love," leading to her first kiss with Ron. Cue the Grand Finale's Relationship Upgrade!
    -   Shego is under the influence of the same device. In defiance of the usual "one-sided case" variation, Dr. Drakken spends the entire episode weirded out by Shego's mood swings and _terrified_ by her actions when it's set to "very angry". The two only get an implied kiss.
-   In the _Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated_ episode "Night Terrors", Shaggy and Daphne breathe hallucinogenic fumes and end up making out and then snuggling, much to Fred and Scooby's horror. Daphne thought she was kissing Fred, and Shaggy thought he really was Fred (not that he seems overly regretful once coming to his senses).

    Real Life 

-   According to Kate Fox, the sociologist author of _Watching the English_, this explains all drunkenness. British people are too chronically shy to just say they like someone, instead they get drunk, (not accidentally but as a deliberate aim) then kiss under the influence. Either you end up in a relationship or you can claim you were kissing under the influence. This idea is supported by studies that show that people can still get drunk on alcohol-free placebos, getting drunk in order to behave badly, rather than behaving badly because they are drunk.
