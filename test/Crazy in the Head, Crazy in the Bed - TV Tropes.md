_"Today, after a 2-month relationship, I realized two things: A) Dating a known psycho because "crazy chicks are great in bed" is a dumb idea, and B) What crazy chicks are actually great at is beating the crap out of you and driving you to alcoholism."_

The stereotype that a person who's mentally unstable makes for a passionate and satisfying lover.

This is due to the belief that their mental instability makes them more enthusiastic and uninhibited, often being into unthinkable kinky stuff that a "normal and boring" person never would be. Power Dynamics Kink and Romanticized Abuse are frequently involved.

If they're obsessed with a person in specific, such as a Yandere or a Stalker with a Crush, there is the idea that they're so utterly devoted to that person's needs that they will go to any lengths in order to satisfy them.

This can be the excuse for why someone would want to remain in a relationship with someone who's obviously unhinged or why they want to have Sex with the Ex with their Psycho Ex-Girlfriend.

This archetype is most commonly attributed to women since All Men Are Perverts and are more willing to look past a person's flaws as long as they're getting laid. Sometimes they can see it's a bad idea, but will still consider the experience to be Worth It. Openly crazy men are usually not seen as attractive to women unless they also invoke a bad boy aura or a woman dates them under the belief they can "fix him".

Sister trope to Cute But Psycho, which tends to feature characters who are somewhat younger, focusing more on things like high school crushes than adult sexual relationships.

Expect the phrase "Daddy Issues" to be mentioned at least once.

This stereotype is commonly applied to Goths.

Compare Aroused by Idiocy, which is about intelligence rather than mental illness. Frequently overlaps with The Ophelia; see also Dominatrix, Mad Love, Sadist, Sex God, and Sex Is Violence. The trope itself can be considered Unfortunate Implications due to it sexualizing and fetishizing women with mental health issues in addition to being an offshoot of Hysterical Woman, which itself portrays women as overly emotional and mentally unstable.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   Harley Quinn is often sexualized due to her being a Sexy Jester with Ax-Crazy / Cloudcuckoolander tendencies, and is often show to be a wild and enthusiastic lover.

Despite how blatant "bad news" she is, men still keep falling for her. She even managed to seduce Kingpin (who's usually very loyal to his wife) and impress him with her passion and sexual prowess.
-   _Deadpool_: Deadpool might be gruesomely disfigured, but his sheer insanity and quirkiness has attracted him a lot of women and it apparently translates great to the bedroom, as he has had many lovers who were quite happy with his performance. He once even managed to impress a Succubus.

Soon enough the fight evolves into Sex for Solace instead.

    Fan Works 

-   Fanfics of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ have an odd tendency to depict Pinkie Pie as very sexually active in the very least. Just as an example, _Advice from Pinkie Pie_ has her as an Ethical Slut.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Batman Returns_, Selina quips: "It's the so-called 'normal' guys that always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're committed."

    Jokes 

-   A lunatic escapes from the asylum and has sex with a prostitute. The next day, the newspaper headline reads: "NUT BOLTS AND SCREWS." Alternatively, he has sex with a laundrywoman before escaping, and the headline is "NUT SCREWS WASHER AND BOLTS."

    Literature 

-   _The Age of Madness_ has the Judge, a ruthless and unhinged revolutionary who takes great pleasure in having people thrown off of a tower. Her insanity is reflected by her visual appearance as well: she always wears a ragged red dress and goes barefoot, and likes to demonstratively put up her dirty bare feet on the table during the court hearings. However, she emits so much sexual energy that it's difficult even for her enemies to resist her charms (like Gunnar Broad, who eventually becomes her lover).
-   _Binder of Shame_: The narrator mentions that one of his returns to gaming happened after he fell foul of this belief.
    
    I had been torn between a very pretty and level headed brunette and a deeply disturbed redhead. For a time I couldn't decide which of the two I was \[to\] date exclusively.  
    Like most men I went with the crazy redhead and it ended in disaster. A very sexy disaster but a disaster nonetheless.
    
-   _Odd Thomas_: Odd's father firmly believes that the more unstable a woman is, the better she'll be in bed. Odd's mother must have been a fantastic lay by that logic since her method of dealing with stress in Odd's childhood was to threaten to shoot herself every time he needed something (and once even pressed a gun to his eye because he was coughing).
-   Played for disturbing horror in _A Study in Emerald_, where a debauched German prince (the Humanoid Abomination spawn of a Lovecraftian cosmic entity and a human) is lured into a trap by Sherlock Holmes with the promise of raping a virgin driven to madness by his appearance.
    
    Having learned a little of his recreational predilections, I told him I had procured for him a girl, abducted from a convent in Cornwall where she had never seen a man, and that it would only take his touch, and the sight of his face, to tip her over into a perfect madness.
    
    Had she existed, he would have feasted on her madness while he took her, like a man sucking the flesh from a ripe peach leaving nothing behind but the skin and the pit. I have seen them do this. I have seen them do far worse.
    

    Live-Action TV

    Podcast 

-   In the podcast _Based Camp_, Malcolm theorizes that emotional outbursts are indulged in very attractive women, people are more likely to comfort and soothe them when they're upset. This positive attention serves to reinforce this behavior, and so a hot woman who's treated that way — especially in adolescence — is less likely to learn the kind of emotional regulation that's expected of everyone else. But while a hot woman loosing her composure might get her positive attention in the short term, it doesn't work out for her in the long run. Subpar emotional regulation skills aren't wife material, it doesn't make people want to stick around in the long run.

    Video Games 

-   _Baldur's Gate_ Of the possible Love Interests, Viconia DeVir is by far the most unhinged, due to her evil upbringing as a Undercity drow, her antagonizing attitude and her constant mood changes.

Your companions (and even herself) seem to assume you're only romancing her because she's a crazy hot drow.

But she has long grown bored of sex and prefers focusing on her experiments, much to Octa's distress, though she's still quite aware of her sexual prowess, and can be seductive when she wants.
-   _Fallout 3_: Eulogy Jones will explicitly mention Clover fits the stereotype of crazy girls being wild in bed when he's trying to pimp her to you.
    
    **Eulogy Jones:** I'll tell you why: because Clover is the craziest girl I've ever seen. And I'm an expert on crazy girls. Crazy in a fight, crazy in the sack, crazy every which way but loose! But most of all, she's crazy in love with whoever's holding her leash. And for the low cost of a thousand caps, Miss Clover could be crazy for you.
    
-   _Mortal Kombat_: Mileena is one of the most sexualized characters in the franchise, and her being an aggressive psychotic "freak" is part of her appeal, and despite her Monstrous Mandibles, she's still one of the most promiscuous characters.

Four outfits per clan and gender become available through the course of the story, and while male Malkavians only get sexualized in that their final outfit resembles a pimp's, all four outfits for female Malkavians are heavily sexualized. The first is a cheerleader outfit with too high a thong and too low a skirt. The second is a cowgirl outfit with a bare butt. The third is a sexy cop costume with thigh-high boots. The fourth outfit is a tight leather jumpsuit that would be decent if not for the "XXXploit me" bit on the back. No other player character wears clothes that can be called "inviting" like these.
