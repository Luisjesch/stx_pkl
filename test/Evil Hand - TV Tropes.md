Mein Führer! I can't breathe!

_"You_ do _know you gave me an evil hand, right? I've been writing 'Kill, kill, kill' on everything. It's crazy. It's crazy! Anything could happen!"_

— **Lindsey McDonald**, _Angel_

A limb that has a mind of its own (often, a transplated limb with the original owner's). Often resists and moves in ways that are detrimental to the body it's attached to. Despite the name, does not necessarily have to be _evil_, per se - some examples are simply annoying, or even symbiotic to the owner. May try to take over the owner's body. Artificial Limbs may demonstrate this property as well, in which case it can tie into Cybernetics Eat Your Soul.

May be a Red Right Hand.

There's quite a cultural basis for this effect: As humans, we've always been fascinated superstitiously by the way our own bodies work and where our own consciousness lies. Also Truth in Television as the brain condition known as alien hand syndrome can cause people to lose control of a limb, which is caused with damage to the corpus callosum, especially through split-brain surgery, previously used to end life-threatening epileptic seizures.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Not entirely "evil", but when Claire transplants Irene's arm in _Claymore_ it seems to have a mind of its own until she learns to control it.
-   In the first chapter/movie of _The Garden of Sinners_, Shiki's artificial arm is remotely possessed by the ghost she is following and tries to choke and throw her off a balcony.
-   _Hell Teacher Nube_'s titular character lost his left hand fighting a massively destructive Oni, but was able to seal this foe as a replacement hand. Although he can usually keep the Oni under control, it will sometimes try to take over his whole body. When it and Nube finally come to terms, the Oni willingly resumes its duty as Nube's hand, but is completely self-aware and becomes prone to playing with its host (slapping women's butts, drawing on the blackboard, pulling on Nube's eye...
-   _Kinnikuman_ villain Ashuraman has the power to steal the arms from dead Choujin for his own use. When he and Sunshine fight the Muscle Brothers in the Dream Tag arc, however, this backfires when one of the arms taken belongs to the late Prince Kamehame, who is firmly on the side of the good guys, even in death. Kamehame's hand chokes Ashuraman at a critical moment in the fight.
-   In _The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service_, Yata, the least openly talented of the main characters, only has one particular ability: channeling. However, he only seems to be able to channel one particular being— an extraterrestrial, who speaks via Yata's hand-puppet whether Yata wants him to or not. Something of a subversion in that, while he does seem to have nothing but contempt for "inferior" human life, he seems to like Yata and sometimes tries to boost his self-esteem.
-   _Naruto_'s Kabuto tried to gain Orochimaru's power by transplanting parts from one of his bodies into himself. He notes that at the start of the process the power nearly consumed him.
-   Shinichi from _Parasyte_ wound up with a talking, shapeshifting alien symbiote hand after managing to prevent it from spreading to and consuming his brain. In a bit of a subversion, since its fate is tied to its host's survival, Migi is actually pretty cooperative and tries to look out for Shinichi's best interests, but has no concept of human empathy or standards of behavior—in response to his host's attraction to a girl in his class, it turns into a _giant penis_ in the middle of a restaurant, and that's just not right!
-   _Project ARMS_ has a lot of replacement nanotech body limbs that don't necessarily do what you want, powered by the various emotions of a little girl who imprinted herself onto space rock, and the main character Ryo's artificial arm is definitely self-aware and not the nicest replacement of the lot, basically being the little girl's hatred.
-   Inversion in the manga (and in "Season 0" of the anime) of _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ After Yugi and his friends cut off the hand of Yami Bakura's avatar, Zorc Necrophades, in the dark tabletop game, Ryo Bakura is able to retake control of that hand in his body, resulting in an _evil_ character with a _good_ hand doing its own thing. Yami Bakura tries to stop it by impaling the hand on a spire of his ornately constructed game world.

    Comic Books 

-   Golden Age Captain America foe the Black Talon was an artist named Pascal Horta whose right hand was crushed in an automobile accident, leaving him unable to paint. His doctor arranged to have African-American killer "Strangler" Burns donate his hand for a transplant before being executed in the electric chair for his crimes. Desperate to once again be able to paint, Horta agreed to the operation and had the criminal's hand transplanted onto his arm. Soon, Horta began painting images of death and violence. Believing that the hand of "Strangler" Burns was effecting his mind, Horta snapped and began calling himself the Black Talon. He then began targeting local artists. After murdering his victims he left a painting of their moment of death as his Calling Card to the authorities.
-   _Claw The Unconquered_, a Barbarian Hero from DC Comics, had a deformed, claw-like right hand (the result of a curse placed on his family) that would sometimes fight against him.
    -   A different version of Claw appeared in the comic _Primal Force_. John Chan became the Claw after buying an ancient suit of armour and sword. The Claw of Pytharia, which had been dormant in one of the gauntlets, cut off his hand with the sword and grafted itself in place. The demonic spirit of the claw increased his fighting skills, but made it difficult for him to control his anger.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1992)_: On Death Mountain, Link sees a vision of his dead parents standing with his uncle. Link reaches for his mother's hand when she extends hers out to him, but Link's hand turns into a werewolf claw when it passes the portal's boundary.
-   In _Scud the Disposable Assassin_, an entire story arc was based on Scud (a robot) losing an arm and getting a human one as a loaner while he was waiting for the parts to come in. Then he discovered that the arm had belonged to a werewolf, and could take over his mind when the moon was full.
-   There was supposed to be a 'haunted hands' sub-plot in issue 22 of _Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_, but it was cut from the final printing on account of taking up too much space. It would've involved Ratchet believing that his hands were haunted and constantly punching Drift in the face, whereupon hilarity would ensue. For those who think that this sounds hilarious and regret its omission, it has been recreated in full by colorist Josh Burcham.

    Fairy Tales 

-   Older Than Radio: The Brothers Grimm give an account of three army surgeons who use the original formula to remove and replace their own hand, heart or eyes. A sad accident led to them to having them replaced with those of a hanged thief, a pig, and a cat, respectively. The man who ended up with a thief's hand found he couldn't resist stealing.

    Films — Animation

    Films — Live-Action 

-   An unusual variation in _Battle Beyond the Stars_. Big Bad Sador replaces his damaged arm with a limb from one of the Nestor clones (whom he captured and tortured to death). Not a true Evil Hand, as it is not independent, but still telepathically controlled by Nestor, a Hive Mind who use the opportunity to attempt to assassinate Sador by using the hand to grab a knife and slit his own throat. Sador's doctor is forced to chainsaw the arm off without waiting for anesthetic.
-   _The Beast with Five Fingers_ revolves around a murderous hand that has detached itself from the corpse of a dead pianist and which attempts to kill the heirs to his will. Except the ending has some of the survivors suggest it was actually a plot by a greedy heir to kill off the others, only for that heir to end up killing himself after he went mad and began believing his own lie.
-   _Body Parts_ involves a psychologist who finds himself getting possessed by an arm he received after losing the old one in an accident. A painter who got the other arm and an athlete who got the legs experience this as well. Turns out these once belonged to a killer, and the surgeon who transplanted the limbs put the guy's head on another body, while holding on to the torso so all the parts could continue to wreak their havoc.
-   The zombie arm in the elevator in _The Cabin in the Woods_ which trips Marty, and is last seen crawling onto the face of the unconscious guard.
-   Happens with a possessed _leg_ in _Cradle of Fear_. Nick Holland is an amputee who is unable to engage in sexual activity with his girlfriend Natalie due to his frustration with the loss of his left leg in a prior accident. Nick visits his old friend Thomas and shoots him in the head. He then removes Thomas' left leg, puts it on ice and has it transplanted to himself by his doctor overnight. Nick goes through rehabilitation and eventually becomes able to move his transplanted leg. One night, while driving with Natalie, Nick loses control of his leg which steps on the accelerator, resulting in a crash that instantly kills Natalie.
-   Due to certain circumstances, Martin in _Dead Snow: Red vs. Dead_ ends up in a hospital, where he gets a zombie-arm grafted on in place of his lost one. This arm is very prone to killing people when he doesn't want to, but it also gives him super strength and an ability to raise the dead as zombies loyal to him.
-   Dr. Strangelove from _Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb_ is a famous example. He was able to help start a nuclear war despite the small setback of having a hand that obeyed his subconscious urges, such as punching himself in the face and giving Nazi salutes. His notoriety is such that the common name for the real-life brain condition "alien hand syndrome" is "Dr. Strangelove Syndrome". Dr. Strangelove's hand is also an example of Parody Displacement, having been lifted from the Mad Scientist Rotwang in the German Silent film _Metropolis_.
-   Ash in _Evil Dead 2_ was forced to chainsaw his own hand off when it took on a life of its own. Unfortunately, it kept trying to kill him. But he found a really cool use for the stump.
-   In the original _The Fly_, the Professor Guinea Pig winds up with one arm replaced by a fly's appendage, and finds himself having to fight his own limb to stop it from preventing his assisted suicide.
-   _The Hand_ (1981) is about a comic book artist (Michael Caine) who loses his hand in a car accident; the severed hand starts to attack people who threaten him.
-   Comedy _Idle Hands_ is about a slacker whose possessed arm goes on a killing spree around a suburban neighborhood.
-   _Johnny English Reborn_: While fighting the effects of a mind-controlling drug, Johnny English regains the control of his left hand while his right hand is still trying to kill the Chinese premier, leading to a quite lengthy one-man fight.
-   _Kiss Me Quick!_: Like Dr. Strangelove's, Dr. Breedlove's black gloved right hand seems to have a mind of its own and keeps attempting to strangle Breedlove or fondle the girls.
-   Fletcher Reede in _Liar Liar_. A straight yet classical Carrey example of Chewing the Scenery where the lawyer who Cannot Tell a Lie because of his son's birthday wish is trying to lie by claiming a blue pen is red ends up with the hand holding said pen seemingly coming to life and vengefully scribbling "This pen is blue" all over his own face. It also gets Invoked in a more down-to-earth playful manner with Fletcher acting as though "The Claw" has taken over his hand and playfully chases his son around with it.

-   The 1935 Peter Lorre film _Mad Love_ in which the famous pianist Orlock suffers an accident and needs to have his hands amputated. The doctor gives him the hands of a recently executed murderer, the hands remember their old skills after the operation. This was actually the second of three versions of the same film, the first being _The Hands of Orlac_ in 1924 starring Conrad Veidt and again in 1960 as _The Hands of Orlac_ with Christopher Lee.
-   Inverted in the climax of _The Nutty Professor (1996)_: When Jerkass Buddy Love pulls back his arm to punch his colleague, Jason, his right abruptly becomes swollen and blubbery and refuses to budge, shortly after reaching over to strangle Buddy and distract him. This is an inversion because the arm's split personality is Nice Guy Sherman Klump, the original personality who is reasserting control of his body.

    Literature 

-   In Guyde Maupassant's short story, "The Hand", Englishman Sir John Rowell, living in France, possesses a collection of hunting trophies, including a severed hand chained and nailed to a wooden board. This hand, claimed to be from a criminal Rowell had killed, incites fear among visitors and seems to move on its own even in death. Under mysterious circumstances, Rowell is found dead in his locked house, with no signs of struggle or intrusion. Strangest of all, the once secured hand has vanished, leaving only its chain behind, thus ending the story on an eerie, unresolved note.
-   In Theodore Sturgeon's "Bianca's Hands" Bianca, who's severely retarded, has hands which are more attractive than the rest of her and move by themselves. Ran (who isn't very bright himself) marries her after falling in love with the hands, only to be strangled by them during the wedding night.
-   In the _Bill the Galactic Hero_ series by Harry Harrison, Bill has his left arm blown off in battle and replaced with the right arm of his bunkmate Tembo. Yes, his left arm was replaced by someone's right arm, you read it right. Besides giving him the ability to do a unique two-handed salute, it sometimes acts of its own volition when its previous owner's pride or religious convictions are on the line. Of course, then there's Bill's foot which has been replaced too often to count, including with a "mood foot" which, because of his burning sexual desires, has transformed itself into a satyr's hoof.
-   In _The Body Politic_ by Clive Barker, pretty close to all of the hands of humanity decide to cast off the chains of bodily attachment. Bloodily, of course, given this is Clive Barker. And then the feet decided they wanted to play, too.
-   Michael Moorcock's character Corum had the "Hand of Kwll," which originally belonged to an ancient god. It acted as a Psycho Supporter, killing several people who posed a threat to Corum, but whom Corum himself had no intention of killing.
-   Initially Played for Laughs in the short story "The DEATH/GRIP Challenge", where an "evil hand" meme becomes popular due to a bad movie within the story. Gradually, things turn serious as some people start to believe they really _do_ have an evil hand and start to do drastic things to prevent the hand from acting out.
-   In the _Discworld We R Igors_ Diary, the personal information section includes "Dominant hand" with the options "left", "right", and "sometimes".
-   In Ray Bradbury's short story "Fever Dream", a sick boy is being taken over by rogue cells, and partway through the process his hands attack the uninfected part of him.
-   In _Harry Potter_, when Wormtail had to cut off his hand to revive Voldemort, his service was rewarded with a replacement hand — one which unfortunately for him was booby-trapped to kill him if he ever helped Harry, since Voldemort never trusted him. The fact that Wormtail didn't actually help Harry at all, but only _hesitated to kill him for just an instant_, didn't stop it from killing him: Voldemort takes some tropes to a whole new level.
-   Stephen King's short story "I Am The Doorway" (published in the collection _Night Shift_) was based around this trope. Although, technically, they weren't so much evil as the protagonist in a Cosmic Horror Story. We're much less likely to look upon killing mind-numbing alien terrors sympathetically when those terrors are _humans_, not tentacled, chitinous monstrosities.
-   _Peace on Earth_ begins with the protagonist explaining how the left half of his body gained autonomy (he blundered into a brain-damaging field and it severed his corpus callosum).
-   In _The Shattered World_, Ardatha is a sorceress whose left hand has been replaced by a demonic-looking one with six fingers and scales. It turns out to be a tool of an actual demon, who's using it to exert an imperceptible influence over her mind. She only realizes this when the demon-hand is amputated in combat.
-   In the _Starlight and Shadows_ novel _Tangled Webs_, when Rethnor loses his hand in combat, the drow priestess Shakti offers to provide him a replacement. Despite being suspicious of her sudden generosity, Rethnor eventually accepts. He quickly discovers that his new limb obeys her will, not his, and will strangle him if he disobeys her.

    Live-Action TV 

-   On the Live Episode of _30 Rock_, Jon Hamm's character Dr. Drew (who has lost both hands) gets a hand transplant. In the East feed version, it's that of a black convict and it tries to strangle him. In the West feed, it's a woman's hand that tries to grope him.
-   An episode of _Amazing Stories_ called "Hell Toupee" contained... an evil wig.
    -   Of course, that title reminds more people of _The Simpsons_ episode "Treehouse of Horror IX", in which Homer was possessed by a hair transplant from Snake.
-   Subverted in _Angel_. Lindsey, having (awesomely) had his hand cut off by Angel in Season 1, gained a mystical replacement with the unfortunate tendency to write "Kill kill kill" on its own due to a psychic connection to the previous owner. Other than that, though, it was pretty harmless. It turned out that its original owner was still alive and conscious while being slowly taken apart by demonic surgeons for organ replacements, and was begging to be killed. Once they did what it wanted the hand stopped acting on its own, though that didn't stop Lindsay using it as an excuse to cause havoc in a board meeting.
    
    "Stop it, evil hand, stop it!"
    
-   _Ash vs. Evil Dead_ sees the return of Ash's possessed severed hand from the second movie (see above). Initially kept as a trophy and means of magically tracking Ash down by Ruby, it eventually regains full mobility and returns to the cabin for the season's climax. Once there, it grows an entire Evil Twin of Ash, who kills Amanda (though not before she cuts the hand off again and chops it up).
-   Played for Laughs when Buffy has to wrap up a mummy hand in the Magic Shop for a customer, only to get stuck in a "Groundhog Day" Loop. The mummy hand drives her to despair with its failure to cooperate.
-   Not quite an "evil" example, but in an episode of _El Chapulín Colorado_, the titular hero loses a hand in an explosion, and gets transplanted a new one that belonged to a ballerina. Hilarity Ensues when the hand starts acting on its own making ballet gestures and caressing nearby people while Chapulin tries (futilely) to rein it in.
-   Parodied in the BBC series _Dead Ringers_, in which Michael Howard — who was leader of the Conservative Party at the time — channeled all of his evil into his left hand, which later defected to UKIP. This forced him to cut it off, resulting in his right hand becoming evil, and subsequently defecting to the British National Party.
-   _Doctor Who_
    -   Played straight in the story "The Ark in Space", in which the Ark's commander "Noah" is taken over by and transformed into an insectoid Wirrn, beginning with his left hand. (In one of the behind-the-scenes interviews the actor recalls how excited he was by this concept, until he saw that the Wirrn hand was simply a piece of bubble wrap that was to be taped over his real hand and dyed green with washing-up liquid.)
    -   Not _quite_ fulfilling the trope, but close, is the title body part in "The Hand of Fear". It's a hand, it's evil, and it takes people over, but it isn't grafted onto anyone.
-   The patient of the week in an episode of _House_ had an arm that had a mind of its own and would often act without his knowledge. It threw things at people, filled his trolley with items he didn't want and liked playing air guitar.
-   Kaoru Kino of _Kamen Rider Agito_ had his arm replaced with that of his brother after they were both caught in a snowstorm during a mountain climbing expedition. His brother died and Kino's arm was lost to frostbite. However, it seems like the arm has a mind of its own at times... though in an inversion of the usual trope, since Kino is the one that's pretty crazy, the arm often tries to _stop_ him doing evil things.
    -   Then there's Ankh from _Kamen Rider OOO_ who is nothing but an evil hand. He completely takes over his host due to the fact that he's dying and unconscious.
-   Played for laughs on an episode of _The League of Gentlemen_, when the uncouth, one-armed joke shop owner gets an arm transplant. It belonged to a nun, and is much nicer than he is. It even prompts him into a Heroic Sacrifice.
-   One episode of _Lessons for a Perfect Detective Story_ involved the murder victim having had brain surgery as a child and having a split personality, which controlled his left hand. Eventually the left-side got angry and tried to kill him/take over. One attempt involved the left hand strangling him.
-   In an episode of _Once Upon a Time_, Hook wants his hand restored before his date with Emma. Mr Gold turns out to have kept the hand for all these years, but warns that it's the hand of the man he used to be, and its reattachment could lead to him reverting from Lovable Rogue back to ruthless killer. After Hook thinks this has happened and demands Gold returns the hook, Gold tells him that nothing of the sort occurred; Hook subconsciously took the presence of the hand as a _licence_ to act as a ruthless killer again.
-   In an early episode of _Red Dwarf_ Rimmer the hologram suffered a corruption of his program which resulted in his digital right arm turning into that of catering officer Olaf Peterson, a dead member of the crew who was, in Rimmer's words, 'a Danish moron'. Peterson didn't like Rimmer in life (no one did), and his arm kept this up in death, punching Rimmer, poking him in the eyes and finishing up by hitting him with a very low blow. Rimmer ended up in the foetal position moaning 'I hate everything', just as Holly the ship's computer assured him that he had it sorted out now.
-   On _SCTV_, Dave Thomas portrayed Michael Caine in a spoof promo for _My Bloody Hand_, parodying the 1981 movie _The Hand_.

    Music 

-   The first six tracks of _Heart of a Killer_ by Winters Bane (Ripper Owens' pre-fame band) tell the story of a judge who unknowingly receives a heart transplant from a man he sentenced to death. Cue possession.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_ lore, the Hand of Vecna is a very powerful artifact... that eventually turns those foolish enough to use it into Vecna. Also available in Eye form.
    -   And then there's the Head of Vecna - no, wait...
    -   Oddly enough, while the head of Vecna is a joke, the heart of Vecna is a real thing and currently rests in the chest of a powerful lich.
    -   There's also the enemy "Crawling Claw", which is a disembodied hand turned undead through necromancy and are only obedient towards the wizard or warlock that originally resurrected it.

    Video Games 

-   One of many unfortunate circumstances possible in _Fallen London_ is waking up with your arm gone and the arm of a Clay Man put in its place. Both you and the Clay Man who now has _your_ arm have serious problems with control, and join forces to find the man/statue who did this to you before things gets any further out of hand.
-   Owain from _Fire Emblem: Awakening_ pretends to have this, with such voice clips as "My sword hand twitches!", "Can't... control!" and "Down, sword hand!". All of the Kids From the Future are a little _bent_ in this game, and this plus Owain's stated preference for Darker and Edgier heroes is his method of coping with the Zombie Apocalypse he came from.
-   In _Machi_, when Ichikawa sleeps, his left hand comes to life (in the form of five little finger-men) and destroys all his attempts at creating a literary masterpiece, either by burning any physical pages, or by deleting any drafts and backups. And if Ichikawa tries to stay awake, it will give him a hand with a narcolepsy bout. It's never explained if this evil hand is a real paranormal entity, or if it's actually a split personality he created himself as a way to preserve his livelihood (Ichikawa's current job of writing TV dramas, while professionally unfulfilling, made him financially successful).
-   Saren from _Mass Effect_ after Sovereign gives him 'implants'.
-   Revolver Ocelot from _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_ lost an arm to an unfortunate ninja attack. His replacement—the arm of Liquid Snake—served him well... until he encountered Solid Snake, at which point Liquid's enraged spirit completely took over Ocelot's mind and caused him to run off with a Humongous Mecha. It seems in the sequel, the two have finally learned to coexist by merging into a single personality. Ocelot also gives a shout-out to Lyon, the site of the first _traditional_ hand transplant, where he gained his transplant: "I never trust a Frenchman," he comments, as he uses his willpower to prevent Liquid taking over. The truth about what really happened is, of course, far more complicated.
-   Okabe pretends to have one of these in _Steins;Gate_. Of course, in reality it's all an act part of his mad scientist persona he created when he and Mayu were kids to prevent her from leaving after her grandmother dies that has carried on into present day. (He states in the game that it felt as though she would join her grandmother in the afterlife if he didn't hold onto her and find a reason to make her stay.) So he held/hugged her and pretended to be a mad scientist holding her hostage so she couldn't leave,and Mayu agreed to it.
-   Stubbs the Zombie, title character from _Stubbs the Zombie in: Rebel Without a Pulse_, can use his zombie hand to crawl in vent and even possess enemies.
-   Guybrush ends up with one of these in the first episode of _Tales of Monkey Island_, after a botched attempt to destroy LeChuck once and for all. He eventually loses it at the start of episode two, and gets it replaced with a Hook Hand.

    Web Animation

-   _Mystery Skulls Animated_: When something possesses Arthur, it first takes takes control of his left arm, which it uses to push Lewis to his death. The arm is then torn off before the thing could completely take Arthur over.
-   _RWBY_: After losing her own left arm, Cinder Fall bonds an arm from a Grimm. Salem has to specifically train her to control the arm, telling her to "make it dread you", which takes months. For the most part she seems to have no trouble with it, because she's almost as evil as it is and its desire to devour Maidens is in line with her own, but it is slowly transforming her body and Salem can seize control of it at any time to hurt her.

    Webcomics 

-   Roger's hand in _College Roomies from Hell!!!_. It starts out as the usual gag where someone paints a face on their hand and starts consulting it as a person. It goes on with the hand gaining a personality of its own. Then, Mr. Hand learns that he can make Roger sleepwalk... did I mention that this is one of the homicidal Evil Hands?
-   _Cursed Princess Club_: Saffron, The One Guy of the eponymous club, has a cursed left hand that sporadically does things that inconvenience him. He got it when a goblin sorcerer tried to pull a full-body Grand Theft Me to take over his kingdom. But the spell was designed to latch onto the evil in the victim's heart, something that Saffron lacked — hence the mere partial takeover.
-   In _Digger_, the village hag _can_ reattach severed limbs, but they run the risk of going crazy and trying to kill their owners.
-   Mr. Purvis from _Eerie Cuties_. Though all it seems to want to do is give bad haircuts.
-   In _Exiern_, 10-year-old Ctyx has his hand replaced by the evil wizard Faden's, and he finds it is very evil.
-   Odd non-evil example in _Goblins_. Klik gives Dies Horribly a replacement arm made of living metal. When he gets scared, the arm grows blades and spikes to defend him. Unfortunately, the (many) situations in which he gets scared tend to go downhill fast if you start brandishing spiky things (and when it goes south he gets even more scared, and the arm gets spikier, and...). Later played straight when it begins to take control in life-or-death situations and tries to kill Saves-a-Fox out of jealousy.
-   In _Pokey the Penguin_, Rick Allen gets his remaining hand possessed by a demon that wants to electrocute a nun.

    Web Originals 

-   _Gaia Online_'s Dr. Singh lost her arm to a semi-homicidal mutant and replaced it with an arm from said mutant. She wound up Brainwashed and Crazy. Technically, Dr. Singh never had the arm lost and replaced. After her young assistant Timmy became mutated, he began eating her arm, getting as far as her shoulder. It was because he was latched on that he could control her mind. She later is saved after getting a Mad Scientist Lab Tech to surgically remove Timmy.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers_ episode "Rogue Arm". Pretty much Exactly What It Says on the Tin. The Queen comes up with a Magitek method of tampering with Zach's bionics. Hilarity does not Ensue.
-   In the _Ben 10: Alien Force_ episode "The Gauntlet" one of the bullies at Ben's school finds a robot hand which lets you shoot lasers. Guess who is the baddie of the episode.
-   In the _Futurama_ episode "The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings", Fry swaps hands with the Robot Devil. The Robot Devil's hands attempt to choke Fry, but (as he says) that effect "will wear off in a couple of days"... or maybe it's Fry's hands that are the evil ones.
    
    **Robot Devil:** These things are always touching me in places!  
    **Fry:** Yeah, they get around!
    
-   _Idle Hands_ is parodied by _Robot Chicken_ as "Idle Nuts", but the less said about that the better. Both the film and the TV show have Seth Green in them, by the way.
-   _The Simpsons_: In "Treehouse of Horror IX", recurring gangster Snake is placed in the electric chair and killed, while his hair is harvested to use as a wig, which contains his personality. Anyone who wears the wig begins to act just like him as it slowly takes over their body and mind.
-   In _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_, Marco tries to get Star to fix his broken arm with magic. One botched/misread spell later, and Marco gets a fully-healed arm... that's now a sentient Combat Tentacle that wants to eat people's bowels.
