What are shadow clones for?

A large number of Mooks jump on the hero, pinning him down.

Usually it's a climactic battle scene. The hero is facing down dozens, no, hundreds, no, THOUSANDS of mooks. At first, the hero's doing well. He's smiting them one after another. But, then he begins to get tired, and first one, then another, then another and another and another leap onto him, dragging the poor guy to the ground.

Often, a bigger villain, such as the Big Bad or The Dragon, stands by and watches.

There are several ways that this scene can turn out:

1.  The hero activates a super mode, has an epiphany, or otherwise becomes more badass. He explodes out of the pile, minions scattering to the four winds, and rises as an epic figure. At this point the fight might continue, or the mooks might run away.
2.  The hero is killed at the bottom of the pile. (This one is pretty rare outside of zombie movies, actually.)
3.  The hero is captured. This can mean assimilation, frozen in stasis, knocked unconscious, or simply dragged off to a prison cell.
4.  A more humorous version, the hero simply gets out of the dogpile. This may involve Offscreen Teleportation, with the hero suddenly appearing to the side somewhere (or even on top of the pile), before the mooks even realize that he's gone and they've just been mobbing each other.

In order to qualify as a Dog Pile of Doom, the hero should be completely covered in mooks. Just a couple of guys jumping on top of the hero is not enough to qualify. Have you ever dropped a piece of food on an anthill? It's something like that.

Differs from the glomp, because the glomp is a sign of affection (even though the victim might not like it). The Dog Pile of Doom is malicious, intended to kill or capture.

Often an Obligatory Joke whenever American football appears in fiction.

Technically, it doesn't have to be the hero at the bottom of the pile. A whole bunch of good guy civilian mooks jumping on the Big Bad would also count as a Dog Pile of Doom.

In video games, this can overlap with Zerg Rush or Bullet Hell. See also Macross Missile Massacre when done with projectiles.

Then, to make matters more horrifying, his former commander and friend Griffith, who was the one who enabled the Eclipse in order to become a demon lord, is reborn as the fifth member of the Godhand Femto, flies down and starts having his way with Casca. Desperate to save her, Guts resorts to hacking off his own arm with a broken sword in order to escape from the demon's grasp and continues his rampage... only to be telekinetically hurled back by Femto's power and then dogpiled by a mess of demons, mere feet away.

-   in _Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa_: King Julien calls for his subjects to do one of these on Mort, to keep Mort from boarding the plane.

-   _Monsters, Inc._: George opens his locker and toys Sulley shoved in there earlier fall on him. Charlie calls another "2319" and CDA agents then burst out of the stalls and tackle George.

-   _Batman: The Movie_ has a scene in which the Joker, the Riddler, the Penguin and their accompanying goon squad burst in on Bruce Wayne and Catwoman (disguised as Russian reporter Miss Kitka), with the intent to kidnap them.

-   The mall cops in _Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure_ use this method to apprehend Genghis Khan and Billy the Kid. (Not that any other way would have likely been feasible with those two...)

-   In _Mars Attacks!_, Byron takes on the Martians hand-to-hand in order to buy time for the others to escape. This appears to be fatal, but he later appears with no explanation as to how he survived. It's notable that in the original script, he did die.

-   Set up magnificently in _Now You See Me_ during Act II of the Four Horsemen's tour. As part of the act, several volunteer audience members are hypnotized to attack the "Quarterback" when they hear the Trigger Word "Freeze". They return to their seats and the show goes on. However, when the Horsemen conclude their performance by publicly robbing their millionaire patron, Agent Rhodes moves in to apprehend them. Being a law enforcement officer in pursuit of fleeing suspects, he naturally yells, "Freeze!" Cue one dogpiled cop and four escaping Horsemen. Hilariously, The Reveal that Rhodes himself is none other than the The Man Behind The Horsemen implies that he willingly sprung that trap on himself.

Húrin and his household stand alone at the last until all his men and his brother Huor lie dead with corpses piled around him. Still Húrin fights on, when his own weapons are lost. His shield is broken. Húrin takes a two-handed axe from an Orc-Captain and fights on. Eighty trolls of the guard of the demon-lord Balrog Gothmog fall before Húrin and each time he sings out, in Elvish, "Day shall come again!" The axe melts in his hands and still he fights on. Finally, the Orcs dogpile Húrin and overwhelm him because while he can cut off their limbs, too many of their claws and arms remain attached to him and he is overwhelmed and taken captive. This is a classic example of You Shall Not Pass! and Heroic Sacrifice for Húrin, and a Despair Event Horizon and Start of Darkness for his family and his people.
-   In _Friday_, the eponymous Friday is captured in this way. Later, "Boss" Baldwin says, "You killed two and injured three before they piled enough bodies on you to hold you down by sheer weight."
-   In _Hard to Be a God_, Earth observer (and proto-Progressor) Rumata is defeated like this. He is a capable combatant when faced with another (or multiple duelists) due to the physical advantages of Noon Universe humans, plus the combat training that is superior to anything on The Dung Ages Arkanar. So, what does Don Reba do? He gets 30 of the beefiest, fattest guards, armed only with clubs, nets, and shields. They overwhelm him (despite taking several casualties), then capture him, and bring to Don Reba.

-   _Redwall_: The eponymous character of _Martin the Warrior_ is mobbed by mooks when he attempts to help Feldoh's elderly father, who is being badly treated by the vermin overseers (as they are all three slaves at this point).

-   In the prologue of the novelization of _Robotech_, the Invid are attacking a Zentraedi outpost, where a variation occurs. Dolza, who is at the base at the time, says that the base would undoubtedly be covered completely in Invid mecha "Like a lethal blanket of death".
-   _Warrior Cats_ has a heroic example — Scourge's deputy Bone is killed by being dog-piled by a bunch of apprentices.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _CSI_, "Unfriendly Skies", a victim of the week dies when he starts acting erratically on a plane and a large number of passengers dogpile him. They thought he was drunk or drugged, but he really had undiagnosed encephalitis, which combined unfavorably with altitude and air pressure changes.
-   _Iron Fist (2017)_: Danny and Davos are dogpiled by all of the mooks fighting them in a hallway and somehow knock them all away.
-   _Star Wars_: In _The Book of Boba Fett_, when the other crime families of Mos Espa betray Boba, Black Krrsantan is seen being dragged to the ground and dogpiled by a number of Trandoshan foot soldiers.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   A common spot in multi-man matches featuring The Giant, The Big Guy, World's Strongest Man or "Monsters". Multiple wrestlers will swarm on the big man, usually leading to the big man will throwing them all off and start kicking ass.

-   In Rugby, this is called a Maul.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition_: 3.5<sup>th</sup> splatbook _Cityscape_ introduces rules for rampaging mobs. While your typical mob is composed of ordinary citizens with no class levels, it is _way_ more dangerous than its individual parts. Even mid- to high-level characters caught in an angry mob are likely to be grabbed, pinned down, trampled and pummeled to death. By its very nature, a mob negates most defenses like armor, agility or invisibility, much like a swarm.

    Video Games 

-   The boss battle against Ra's al Ghul in _Batman: Arkham City_ includes sequences where a horde of ninjas leaps at Batman from all directions, with the action slowing down while they are still in mid-air. The player must rapidly press the "counter" button to account for every single ninja before they land; if this is done right, the player is rewarded with the sight of Batman exploding out of the dogpile.
-   In _God of War III_, enemies will frequently attempt this on Kratos, leading to him cutting his way free.
-   _Henry Stickmin Series_: On the Bounty/Rescue Route in _Completing The Mission_, one of options for getting past the Right Hand Man is a dogpile. If chosen, Henry and his team will dogpile on the Right Hand Man and then the Right Hand Man's own men become ecstatic and join in on the dogpile in excitement. The choice ends up being a fail though, as the Right Hand Man blows everybody off of him.
    
    **Fail Text:** Everyone! Pile on!
    
-   Mobs of enemies will often try this on Juliet in _Lollipop Chainsaw_ (which results in breaking free or dying depending on the player's actions), a clear case of Double Entendre considering the type of character she is.
-   _Mortal Kombat_: In _Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3_, one of Scorpion's fatalities is to teleport the opponent into Hell and dogpile them with countless doppelgangers of himself.
-   Ann odd variant occurs in _NieR: Automata_ where 2B and 9S are overwhelmed in this fashion, seconds after the dogpile completes everyone is destroyed by the two activating their self-destruct mechanisms just after finishing copying their minds elsewhere to backup bodies.
-   Mario and Goombella pull a slip out of one at the start of _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_, leaving Lord Crump to be pummeled in their place.
-   A cutscene in _\[PROTOTYPE\]_ has the basic infected do this to Alex and he busts out the Armor and Blade powers. In gameplay, you can do something similar with the Knuckle Shockwave and a decent-sized group of infected.
-   The average Mooks can dogpile you in _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game_, prompting you to button-mash your way out, which will immediately defeat them. The funniest one is Kim's, who shrugs as the enemies fly off her as if she had no idea what's going on.
-   In _Sengoku Basara 4_, some groups of enemy soldiers will attempt to do this. Since the character you're controlling is always a One-Man Army, this leads to breaking out a moment of button mashing later (assuming you don't just swat them away before they can even land on you).
-   One segment of _Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time_'s opening has Murray get dogpiled on by several of Le Paradox's Mooks. Considering he has Super-Strength, Murray ends up busting out after a brief Quick Time Event.

Strangely, nobody actually _wants_ this position, so everyone begins to run and try to escape. However, once Numbuh 13 gets tagged, everyone around him immediately dog-piles onto him, screaming, "ANYONE BUT HIM!" because they'd rather tag themselves than let him become their leader.

-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   On "Lesson Zero", a doll gets turned into an Apple of Discord <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Big Macintosh has it, and he gets dog-piled by nearly every background pony. Big Macintosh literally sends them flying over the horizon after it's taken by the Mayor. In fact, it doesn't even really work in the first place; Big Mac is clearly standing on the bottom half of the dog pile, and the top half can only cover him up to his neck.
