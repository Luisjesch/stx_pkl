Don't confuse him for a hack writer.

_"Metatron acts as the Voice of God. Any documented occasion when some yahoo claims that God has spoken to them, they're speaking to me. Or they're talking to themselves."_

Showing up in deuterocanonical and apocryphal text, Metatron is an angel that acts as the Voice of God. Believed to be Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah who Ascended to a Higher Plane of Existence in Biblical text, Metatron acts as the "Lesser YHWH", God's own Mouth of Sauron. Because of His tremendous power, Metatron will give out messages from Him as people are capable of withstanding Metatron's presence. Out of the angels Metatron is rather unique; he's one of few angels without an -el in his name, and one of the only times a human becomes an angel.

A popular figure in Judeo-Christian mysticism, Metatron may or may not be considered an archangel but he is usually depicted with a high position in the angelic hierarchy. He is sometimes used to explain God's judgement being harsher in the Old Testament; Metatron was more active then, and has a low opinion on humanity now that he has the purity of an angel. Besides being God's Mouth of Sauron, Metatron is seen as God's holy scribe and a figure of wisdom. Under the traditional characterization, Metatron is an Emissary from the Divine.

His name, in Greek, means "Next to the Throne", i.e. God's right-hand angel, though this etymology is disputed in some circles. Not to be confused with Name-Tron, or Megatron in particular. Also not to be confused with Mettaton.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Dogma_: Metatron is God's Translator Buddy, speaking on Their behalf because mere mortals cannot withstand God's true voice ("We went through five Adams before we figured that one out."). He shows up in Bethany's bedroom to warn of the impending end of the universe. With God incapacitated at the moment he serves as the Big Good, though is kind of a dick.

    Literature 

-   _Accel World_: She is one of The Four Saints, initially the Final Boss of Country Cathedral before being controlled by the Acceleration Research Society to guard the location of the ISS Kit Core. Her normal form is rather abstract and she admits to not having the same concept of good and evil as people, but she's capable of taking a cuter humanoid form.

-   _Good Omens_: Metatron serves as the spokesperson of God, and in the book appears to Adam after he cancels the apocalypse to start it back up. In the TV series, it's Gabriel who talks to Adam instead. It's also described as _the_ Metatron.
-   _His Dark Materials_: Metatron is the Regent for the Authority, the very first angel and the Demiurge figure of the franchise. Long ago he imprisoned the Authority and took control of the angels for himself. As Enoch he had a brother called Baruch, who became an angel too.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Good Omens (2019)_:
    -   Metatron returns from the book played by Derek Jacobi, however, his role is reduced, with him only appearing in the bookshop to confirm to Aziraphale that yes, Heaven is just as intent on starting Armageddon as Hell is. He looks like a glowing floating head, and states to speak to him is to speak to God, but his presence is really, as Aziraphale points out, akin to the Presidential Spokesperson when you want to speak to the President.
    -   Appears in season 2 as well, when he asks Aziraphale to become the new Supreme Archangel of All Heaven.
-   _Supernatural_: Metatron fills the roll of God's scribe. However with God being absentee and the archangels interesting in taking over the universe, he feels he can use his expertise to fill the God role himself. Unlike in the source material he wasn't human, but a glorified pencil pusher until God chose him to be his scribe. When he learns the level of God's apathy, he's rather offended. Also, like his brother Archangel Gabriel, he grows to genuinely appreciate humanity despite our many flaws, in contrast to the significantly more cynical views of his siblings (we're maggots) and Father (we're disappointments).

    Music 

-   _Darkwell_ has an album named "Metatr\[o\]n" that includes the song of the same name where the origin of the Nephilim is described from such character's POV.

He's described as a towering humanoid being of pure fire with countless wings constantly folding and unfolding behind it and constant electricity sparkling around it.

    Video Games 

-   _El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron_: While not called Metatron _yet_, the game is titled as such as it deals with Enoch serving as God's scribe and teaming up with the as-of-yet unfallen Lucifel to deal with the Nephilim causing chaos. The implication is this is Enoch half-way between assuming the identity of Metatron.
-   _Granblue Fantasy_: Metatron is one of the primarchs and Lucilius' final creations who first appears in "Light's Reverie" to test the protagonist. Having power over light, he was created with the purpose of counterbalancing Avatar and inhibiting his destructive impulses. He has power that rivals Lucifer, however his body is incapable of staying whole for long periods of time and he self-destructs when that time passes.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_: Metatron is a recurring boss that stands in for YHVH when He's not available. He's a robotic Winged Humanoid, reflecting his extreme dedication to YHVH even by the standards of other angels. According to Naoya in _Devil Survivor_ and Mido in _Shin Megami Tensei IV_, his backstory as a human called Enoch still stands, with Naoya calling him as such when he speaks back to him.
-   _Silent Hill_: The (fictional) Seal of Metatron appears throughout the franchise as one of the symbols associated with the Order. It is said to give its bearer incredible supernatural protection and dispelling abilities regardless of whether or not they are good or evil. It is a powerful sigil, though some see it as a piece of junk.

    Visual Novels

Not that she regretted it.

    Webcomics 

-   _Archipelago_: Deep in the underground tunnels of the islands, the ruins of a fallen civilization are filled with magical automatons called Metatrons which resemble pink balls of light with wings. The heroes encounter one which deems them trespassers and threatens to have them disintegrated if they don't provide the proper password. Once the correct password is entered into a console, it becomes completely friendly and leads them to an elevator.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: Metatron 1 was the scribe of YISUN, and privy to God's secrets. Originally thought slain with the rest of the Prime Angels by the Conquering King during his conquest of Throne, Metatron is later revealed to still be alive but trapped on the edge of death after the Conquering King tortured the 777,777 true voices of God out of him and forged the first Magus Key from them. Metatron is the creator and leader of the Thorn Knights, a faction of angels who seek to sterilize Throne of mortals and return the angels to watching over an empty Universe. Later revelations by Jagganoth puts this narrative in some question: According to Jagganoth, Metatron is the Greater-Scope Villain and _gave_ the voices of God to Zoss, and is currently forcing Zoss to trap existence in a "Groundhog Day" Loop while looking for a 'true successor' for some unknown reason. Even Jagganoth doesn't know why yet (and this doesn't explain why Metatron is trapped in his own shell), but he plans to take Zoss' Key to slay Metatron and end the cycle once and for all.
