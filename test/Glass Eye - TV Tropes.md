They don't call him "Mad-Eye" for nothing.

_"My grandfather had two glass eyes, and yet he could see. What happened was, he sadly lost one eye (he wasn't careless, he was ill). And he had a glass eye made, exactly like his other perfectly working, blue Scandinavian eye. Then he had one made that was bloodshot, and it was known as "Grandpa's Party Eye". He kept it in a box on the mantelpiece, and when he went out for the evening, he'd take out the false blue one and put in the bloodshot one, and he'd say, "I'm going out now, and I shan't be back 'til they match!"_

— **Sandi Toksvig**, _QI_, "Hypothetical"

Glass Eyes are effectively a slightly more technologically advanced version of the eyepatch but without some of the pirate overtones. So they often get the overtones of the Eyepatch of Power. This particularly happens if the glass eye is designed to not match the other eye.

However, another common use of the Glass Eye is for comedy. The eye ends up being ill-fitting, constantly rolls around in the head, perhaps falls out and rolls around on the floor, leading to some slapstick runaround. A common variation for comedy purposes is to make the eyes wooden. It's just inherently funnier somehow, though you might get the common courtesy of a joke where the wooden eye is going along with a pirate's wooden legs and wooden arms and wooden... other bits. Mention must also go to the common joke format of Ignore the Disability, where people take great pains to try to not stare at the deformity.

See also Electronic Eyes for when the concept gets a futuristic upgrade with some more exotic connotations.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Gauche Adlai in _Black Clover_ has a mirror where his left eye would be that lets him store mana for future use, boost the strength of his spells, and duplicate anyone he sees with it.
-   The protagonist of _Mushishi_, not that one can normally notice. It also serves as a constant reminder of the death that awaits him the moment his other eye disappears. At one point he uses it to make an actual eye for a little girl who lost both of her eyes thanks to a Mushi while her friend looks on and freaks out at the entire thing.
-   In _Descendants of Darkness_, Muraki's right eye is often drawn slightly wider than his left, adding to his unsettling appearance. No explanation is offered in the anime (aside from the fact that it glows with a weird blue or violet light when he's summoning familiars/casting curses/generally being freakish and supernatural), but in the manga, during a confrontation with Tsuzuki, it falls out, revealing it to be a glass eye.
-   An example of an attractive character with one — in _Valvrave the Liberator_, A-drei (A3), a handsome deposed Warrior Prince, gets his eye shot out in the second episode. Later, he comes back with a replacement, which matches his other eye in color, except it isn't drawn with as much detail. The eye and the scar around it are often seen, even though they're under his bangs. It doesn't take away at all from his beauty.
-   In _The Voynich Hotel_, Helena, one of the maids, has an artificial right eye that falls out when she and Taizou Kuzuki inspect the boiler room. She covers it up with a variety of eyepatches for a while, but Kuzuki, feeling guilty about watching her lose it, buys her a replacement.
-   _Fairy Tail_, Erza lost her eye as a young girl after being tortured by her jailers. She's eventually given an artificial eye that cannot shed tears (at first) but can also No-Sell illusions based on eye contact.
-   Remorseless hoodlum Muscular from _My Hero Academia_ lost an eye to the last Heroes he killed before being captured, and wears an odd lens-like prosthesis over his empty socket
-   _Lupin III: Part II_: during his second appearance, Phantoma Mark has both eyes made of glass, and in one scene his assistant pulls them out of their sockets and proceeds to wash them.

    Comic Books 

-   _Kabuki_: While kabuki is stuck in prison, a fellow agent switches her glass eye with a guard's. Her eye is smaller so the guard's eye falls out every time he bends over. It plays into their escape plan.
-   Teddy "Red" Herring, the title character of _Red Herring_, is said to have an obviously fake right eye. The artwork depicts both eyes as identical and they move in tandem, but it's so obvious to the other characters that he constantly fields questions about it — and gives a different answer each time.
-   Recurring ineffectual villain Doktor Kreuzer from _Alan Ford_ is revealed to have a glass eye when Alan elbows him in the abdomen, causing the eye to pop out. As part of a minor goof, which eye is the glass one seems to depend from story to story.
-   In _Maus_, Vladek discusses his glass eye and how he's losing vision in his remaining eye due to cataracts. He tells Art a story of how a young doctor told him that the glass eye looked perfectly healthy during an examination.

    Fan Works 

-   _Past Sins_: _Glimpses 2_: "Day": An Eye Scream that came out of fighting a Cult had the affected eye replaced by "a magically enhanced prosthetic". A _glass_ prosthetic.

    Films — Animation 

-   Ms. Crawley, the elderly lizard in _Sing_ has a glass eye, which kicks off the plot when it falls out and presses the "0" key on her keyboard twice, increasing the prize for the singing competition to 100,000 dollars.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Art of the Dead_, Father Mendale has a glass from when he gouged his own eye out to free himself from the influence of the Envy painting.
-   Michael Burry from _The Big Short_ lost an eye due to a childhood illness. He discusses it, to the discomfort of the candidate he's interviewing, and a flashback shows the eye popping out due to a hard tackle during a football game.
-   _Captain Marvel (2019)_ finally shows how Fury lost his eye, and in the end, Coulson presents him with a selection of glass eyes as a replacement. Given that all his other appearances show him with his trademark Eyepatch of Power, he apparently chose to forego using one.
    -   Which makes sense as _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ shows He still has the blinded eye under the patch to use as a backup secondary retinal scan
-   Captain Ron from the movie _Captain Ron_ has a glass eye, but he won it in a poker game and it doesn't fit properly, so he usually has it covered with an eyepatch to hold it in. Later in the movie, during a festival, he tries to remove the eyepatch to blend in, but then his eye spontaneously pops out and bounces away. After searching around for a while, he gives up and puts the eyepatch back on. Since it's Kurt Russell playing this character, it could be a comedic Shout-Out to his more famous character, Snake Plissken.
-   _Fools' Parade_: Appleyard has a bulging glass eye that is sometimes emphasized by the camera for comedic or dramatic effect, and which he claims gives him prophetic visions.
-   In _Gangs of New York_, Bill "The Butcher" Cutting put out his eye because it offended him when he lost to Priest Vallon in a street fight in early 19th-century New York City. He replaced it with a glass eye... with an _American Eagle for an iris_. He taps it with his steak knife to emphasize a point. Daniel Day-Lewis did the scene without blinking.
-   Mr. Benedict in _Last Action Hero_ has a selection of glass eyes, some of which double as bombs. Each of them with different motifs for the iris (such as a Happy Face or a target or a crosshair).
-   In _None Shall Escape_, Wilhelm gets one after losing his left eye to a stone thrown by Jan. It gives Marja an opportunity to snark at him.
    
    **Wilhelm:** What are you staring at?  
    **Marja:** I'm trying to see one spark of pity.  
    **Wilhelm:** In which eye?  
    **Marja:** The left one.  
    **Wilhelm:** _\[chuckles\]_ That's the glass one.  
    **Marja:** I know.
    
-   Ragetti in _Pirates of the Caribbean_ has a wooden eye that has a tendency to fall out a lot and/or "splinter something fierce" especially when he rubs it. He wants to spend his share of the treasure to buy a glass one that fits. In _At World's End_, it turns out to be one of the Pieces of Eight needed to free Calypso. He switches to a proper Eyepatch of Power after that.
-   _The Sons of Katie Elder_ has a Lovable Rogue as one of the sons. He has the trick of auctioning off his glass eye in a raffle at a bar in order to get money for drinks.
-   In _Valkyrie_, Stauffenberg wears a cosmetic eye on formal occasions and an Eyepatch of Power on normal ones.
-   The Smokers' leader in _Waterworld_ gets a plastic eye. Arguably, it looked more disgusting than the empty socket, so he switches to an eyepatch.
-   In _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, the Toon who really killed Marvin Acme uses two of these to cover up his ever-shifting red eyes as part of his Human Disguise. He fits the glass eyes into the eyeholes of his rubber mask, and he appears to have no trouble seeing through them.

    Jokes 

Jewish joke from bad days. A KZ. The SS man says to the jew: "Today is my birthday, and I spare your life if you solve a riddle. I have a glass eye. Left or right?" The jew answers without hesitation: "Right, Mr. SS man!" "Damn jew, how did you know?" "It stared so kindly, Mr. SS man!"

    Literature

-   _Discworld_
    -   A very creepy version is Mr. Teatime from _Hogfather_. He has a grey (black in the Film of the Book) glass eye that may actually be a crystal ball. As the author makes clear, though, it's Teatime's _real_ eye that is the scarier, with its pinhole-sized pupil.

His eye also has some particularly creepy abilities such as being able to see through things and turn around in his head to watch all behind him, as befits his ever-watchful, ever-paranoid personality.
-   Wednesday from _American Gods_ has one. The eye itself doesn't play an overly significant role in the plot (though it plays a role) but it's one of the clues to Wednesday's real identity.

-   In a WW2 novel set in Italian-occupied East Africa (can't remember the title), a British soldier tells the natives he'll leave his eye behind to make sure they don't get up to mischief. It doesn't work because one of them is a former sailor and knows all about glass eyes.
-   _Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe_ has Frank Bennett have one glass eye, which he got after a bullet destroyed the real one.

-   Two-Faced Bretan Braith Lantry of _Dying of the Light_ sports one, made of a material that glows blood red at night.

He can see with them at least as well as he could with his original eyes, even through the blindfold he wears over them.
