**Maude Lebowski:** The story's ludicrous. Good Lord, you can imagine where it goes from here...  
**The Dude:** He fixes the cable?  
**Maude Lebowski:** Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

If pornography is to be believed, no profession results in higher rates of sexual promiscuity than being a pizza delivery boy. Any mention of pizza in a pornographic movie will result in a pizza boy having sex. You'd be surprised that there aren't people clamoring to sign up with Pizza Hut or Domino's just for the _tips_ alone. Expect to hear some really cheesy dialogue about the "meat-lovers' special" or "extra sausage." Heaven help if they come up with witty dialogues for controversial toppings like pineapple<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and anchovies <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .

This trope applies to any profession which offers home delivery service. It gives viewers the thrill of supposedly _anonymous_, spur-of-the-moment sex with the production convenience of a simple living room or bedroom set. Plumbers are frequent candidates, complete with bad "cleaning out your pipes" jokes. Cable television installers are also portrayed as being sex-crazed, as their job will invariably require some screwing, and drills with unusually large bits. Back in the days when kitchens had literal iceboxes, it was frequently the iceman.

It is never explained how the delivery person avoids getting into trouble with their boss back at the office for taking so long to make a delivery, nor how they will explain the lack of tangible payment for services.

Incidentally, in actual pornography, pizza delivery (and cable repair, etc.) _girls_ are starting to become popular, possibly due to overexposure (as it were) of the male sex for this.

If the client is married, see Cheating with the Milkman. Sub-trope of Excuse Plot. Not to be confused with a Delivery Guy Infiltration (though it can easily happen in the work). This is a common scenario for a couple engaged in Kinky Role-Playing.

    Advertising 

-   Channel 4 parodied this in a launch advert for their "adult entertainment" channel, More 4. The advert features Ron Jeremy as a repairman who repairs the TV of a woman with his large, special tool (a large screwdriver).
-   Parodied in a pizza commercial, where an older (late-thirties) woman lures an older (early-forties) pizza delivery "boy" in, despite his protestations of "We're not supposed to go inside", and they enjoy the pizza together with hints of things to come, such as the woman cooing, "Now that's what I call delivery!" ...and then their kid walks in, as grossed out as any kid would be at a hint of parental sexuality. For even more irony? This was an advertisement for a _frozen_ pizza.
-   Visa commercial that raised some controversy: A young muscled plumber comes to repair housewife's bathtub. Then comes the time to pay: the woman smiles seductively and unbuttons the plumber's shirt... to reveal a card reader slot.
-   Parodied in an Australian Strongbow cider commercial where a man spies his neighbours about to make their own erotic video, dons a cheesy costume (complete with fake porn star moustache) and knocks on their door, announcing that he is "here to clean the pool". They invite him in.
-   Parodied in a commercial by PETA that has the dubious distinction of being rejected for the 2004 Superbowl.
-   Parodied in a British beer advert with the message that it's worth taking the time to do something properly — we're treated to a half-assed version of this trope in which the guy lacks a huge moustache and actually starts fixing the fridge. The line "I've come to fix your fridge!" delivered in a Joey-from-_Friends_ voice briefly became a Memetic Mutation.
-   Downplayed in an old TWA ad. The ad was a fairly normal ad talking about superior service and travel experience. Perfectly normal... except the lines were spoken by a trio of stewardess wearing tight short shorts and tight crop tops as they walk across the tarmac to a small plane. You know what they say, "I don't like TWA coffee, but I love TWA tea."
-   One ad for frozen pizza featured a man feeding a woman various foods while she was wearing a Sleep Mask. When he gets to the pizza, she takes off the blindfold, yells "You invited a pizza delivery boy here?! What kind of girl do you think I am?!", and storms off.
-   Citibank ran a series of commercials with people speaking in what was clearly someone else's voice — i.e. the voice of the person who had stolen their identity — bragging about all the stuff they bought with the victim's money. One ended with the line (from a woman's voice): "Tomorrow I'm getting a pool boy... and I don't even have a pool!"
-   Parodied in a Kohler commercial in which a guy sees a good-looking female plumber, and starts flushing stuff down the toilet in a (futile) attempt to stop it up and create an excuse to ask her in.
-   Liquid Plumber has a series of good-looking plumbers telling women that they've come to 'flush your pipes' or 'snake your drain.' In one, the woman says she only has 15 minutes, and he says, "I only need eight!"

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the first episode of _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_, an older woman offers the young plumber a drink and to inspect _her_ plumbing after he is finished with the job. Of course, after the angels show up and mistake him for a ghost, Panty runs off with him to the nearest hotel.
-   _The Wallflower:_ One scene in a montage showing why Kyohei refuses to get a part time job shows one of his (female) bosses expecting him to be a repairman of this variety. The English dub put some emphasis in the line, in case the entendre was too subtle: "I've got some **pipes** that need to get **laid**," indeed.

    Comic Books 

-   Subverted in a story in the pornographic comic book _XXXenophile_, where a vibrator repairman casually disregards the advances of his clients (while leaving them satisfied by doing his job). This ends with a Double Subversion — the repairman follows this trope when he visits a _male_ client. His friends call him Buzz.
-   Done multiple times in _Cherry Comics_: pool cleaner, delivery guy, washing machine repairman...
-   Apparently done in at least one issue of a Bat-family comic book, where it seems like every female villain in Gotham is convening... and then the pizza delivery boy shows up. Harley Quinn in particular is excited to see him. She then ties him up (or has him tied up) and uses him as a human spinner in a game of Truth or Dare. It was the third issue of Harley's own series. Memorable because of the fact that in the face of several beautiful villainesses, the pizza guy starts _screaming_.
-   In a short Stinky strip in _Hate_, he appears in a porno movie playing a pizza delivery boy.
-   In a strip in the Furry Comic _Genus_, a boyfriend has bought a porn video titled _Plumber's Helper_ at the request of his girlfriend. A plumber and a pool guy arrive at a woman's house and the guy assumes the woman is about to be double-teamed. However, when the lady of the house leaves and the plumber and pool guy start getting it on with each other, the guy realises — to his horror and his girlfriend's amusement — that he has accidentally bought a gay porn video.
-   Done deliberately in the _Ramba_ story "Humbling the Boss" where Ramba seduces a grocery delivery driver so she can plant a bomb in his next delivery.
-   Given an extremely dark twist in _The Milkman Murders_ in which a Stepford Smiler housewife with an absolutely dreadful family (abusive drug-addict husband, promiscuous and contemptful daughter sleeping with all her teachers, son who likes to skin small animals) encounters a sinister milk man apparently making a delivery to her home ... whereupon he proceeds to rape her. It leads her to descend into psychotic madness as a result.
-   A Running Gag in the "Fat Slags" strip in _Viz_, in which Sharon and/or Tracy will offer sex to just about any delivery man or tradesman who visits them, because they are perpetually broke and horny, and usually get taken up on it.
-   G-rated version in _Archie Comics_. In one story, the guys start ordering pizza for delivery so they can ogle and chat up the pretty, scantily-clad delivery girl. (According to the girl, her boss had her dress that way specifically to drum up business) Betty and Veronica become delivery girls for Pop Tate, and Hilarity Ensues. The cover for issue 3 of the _Cheryl Blossom: Get a Job_ mini series had Cheryl as a pizza girl for the love-struck Archie (With a ticked-off Veronica in the background to boot);
    
    **Cheryl:** Here it is, **hot and spicy!**  
    **Archie:** **Wow!** And **what** about the pizza?
    

    Comic Strips 

-   A one-panel strip made by Argentinian cartoonist Quino depicted a Fast Love Delivery Service.

    Fan Works 

-   The _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ story _Fluffershy_ has the porn video in the center of the plot kick off with this involving paying both a pizza guy and a package-delivery guy.
-   In _Luna's Plan_ Luna watched too much TV while staying in a Muggle hotel and starts acting out various sitcom situations at Hogwarts in an effort to seduce Harry. Her (successful) final attempt is a pretend pizza delivery complete with an appropriate soundtrack.
-   An _ER_ story has Doug playing this for Carol, even though she'd earlier derided the whole scenario, She rolls her eyes, but jumps his bones anyway.
-   Zig-zagged in _The Mechanic_ with Chloe, the titular mechanic. She's attracted to Max when she first meets her, and is implied to have deduced that Max is into women as well, but she otherwise acts completely professional, albeit friendly and with the occasional mild innuendo (Downplayed Trope). On the other hand, it's made clear that she doesn't mind if nothing comes of her and Max's interactions (Subverted Trope). She ultimately invites Max to her home/workplace for a "private maintenance lesson" a week later with the intent of bedding her (Inverted Trope and Double Subversion).
-   One chapter of an _Invader Zim_ smut collection has an adult Gaz invoking this trope, using her intense sex appeal to seduce pizza delivery guys so that they'll accept sex in lieu of payment for their deliveries. She acknowledges to herself that it's a cliche porno line.
-   In _With Pearl and Ruby Glowing: Part 4_, a commercial for Pizza Planet ends with a disclaimer not to use the delivery service for sexual purposes.
-   Chloé tries to invoke a non-sexual version of this in the _Scarlet Lady_ version of "Guitar Villain" by ordering a pizza and asking them to send their cutest delivery guy, all so she can flirt with him. Unfortunately for her, said pizza guy is Luka, whose opinion of her is already in the toilet and fails to improve when he realizes what she's planning.
-   _Now We Can Be Diamonds Together_: Cheshire invokes this at the end, disguising herself as a pizza delivery girl and offering to let Adam have sex with her instead of paying for the pizza she "accidentally" delivered to his house, all so she can get close enough to him to kill him for threatening her daughter.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Lampshaded in _The Beach Girls_.
    
    **Female character:** Is that a pepperoni in your pocket or are you happy to see me?  
    **Delivery Boy:** It's a pepperoni. (_pulling out a good-sized pepperoni sausage_)  
    **Female character:** (_sighs and grabs his shirt_) Come on...
    
-   Lampshaded in _The Big Lebowski_, as the Dude and Maude watch the intro to the subtly-titled film "LOGJAMMIN'", as quoted above.
-   The indie slasher flick _Breadcrumbs 2009_ indicates that this is basically the theme of the pornographic film the Monster Munch\-in-a-cabin characters are in that secluded cabin to shoot.

-   _Deep in the Valley_: As the protagonists are trapped in a porn movie, they see this happen with both a pizza delivery boy and a pool cleaner. On both occasions, Lester takes the opportunity to steal their vehicles.
-   Erika Lust's film _The Good Girl_, possibly the closest thing to a Deconstruction of porn that you can get, plays out this scenario from the woman's point of view. It starts with the woman discussing with her friend this particular porn trope, so when her pizza delivery boy arrives, she decides to act it out.
-   In _Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,_ one of the jewel thieves tells a pizza delivery man that she's in the mood for "a hot, thick Sicilian". He disappears with her off-screen.

-   The indie film _Pizza 2005_ follows a girl who spends her 18th birthday hanging out with a pizza delivery guy (played by Ethan Embry) because she has no friends. One of their deliveries is a horny housewife; there was no sex, but the girl calls him out on it later — he says he plays to it for the tips.
-   In _Eve's Bayou_, the title character's father Louis is a southern doctor who makes house calls, and doesn't really try to hide from his daughter the fact that he often has sex with his younger female patients.
    
    **Some Skank:** What can you do about... _the pain?_  
    **Louis:** Eve, go play outside. (_closes door_) So what kind of pain are you in?
    
-   _Deep Throat_ has the grocery delivery boy (yes there were such things in 1972 — and there still are in some places) giving oral sex to a woman seated on the kitchen table, and looking slightly bored. At one point she is going to light a cigarette and asks, "Do you mind if I smoke while you eat?"
-   This was the basic plot of all the "Confessions of an X" movies and their many imitators. See Awful British Sex Comedy for details.
-   _Extract_ has a variation with a pool cleaner, complete with a soft-focus scene and poorly-delivered lines.
-   _Machete_ has April and her mother June mistake Machete for the new gardener and invite him to join them in filming a Home Porn Movie. He accepts but afterwards kidnaps them.

His last call turns out to be for his own mother, although he runs away before she sees him.

-   _CarousHELL_: For some reason, when Joe the pizza boy shows up, Laurie decides that she absolutely must have sex with him.

    Folklore 

-   "Crazed sex with a stranger coming to your house" (in some cases, even played down to rape by/of a stranger) has been the subject of many urban myths, which the newspapers of questionable quality have used to increase audience, from the Anglophone countries to former Eastern Bloc.

    Jokes 

-   A common joke related to 18+ videos featuring this is about how _horrible_ a job the person involved is doing, with many jobs using tools either having them neatly arranged (and thus obviously unused), or not being present at all.

    Literature 

-   _Adrian Mole_
    
    _My father rang up from Matlock to say he has lost his Barclaycard and can't get home tonight, so Mr. Lucas and my mother were up all night trying to mend the boiler. I went down at ten o'clock to see if I could help but the door was jammed. Mr. Lucas said he couldn't open it just at that moment because he was at a crucial stage with the boiler and my mother was helping him and she had her hands full._
    
-   The "pool boy" version of the trope is mentioned disparagingly by the narrator of _The Wonder Spot_ when she's reading a lousy manuscript for her publishing job.
-   Played straight in _Fifty Shades of Grey_, when Ana finds out how Christian ended up being taken as Elena Lincoln's submissive. When he was fifteen, he was hired to clear out some rubble as a way to fund his drinking habit and, after he insulted her, she hit him and then kissed him.
-   _Wicked_:
    
    -   Melena's priest of a husband is often away from home. This pains her, especially since she was so promiscuous in her youth. She gets so lonely sometimes that she mentions wishing for this trope:
    
    _I would kill for some tinker to pass by and sell me more than a tin coffeepot! I would pay well for someone less godly and more imaginative!_
    
    -   This trope is Played for Drama. Melena invited a tinker (who turns out to be the future Wizard of Oz) to dinner while her husband was away. It was a simple platonic thing with no ulterior intentions. The man gave Melena an elixir and she passed out. All Melena remembers is having weird dreams of what is implied to be Earth. Nine months later, the Villain Protagonist Elphaba is born.
-   In _Middlesex_, Dr. Luce has Callie watch a low-budget porn film called "Annie Delivers To Your Door," in which the titular pizza girl has sex with a different man at each house, starting with a pool boy. Callie finds the film too raw and unpleasant-looking to be arousing, but she tells Dr. Luce that she's attracted to the pool boy because she knows that's what he wants to hear.
-   In _Martian Time-Slip_, Otto Zitte got kicked out of the repairmen's union for having sex with bored housewives on the job. He starts doing it again after he becomes a Traveling Salesman.
-   Subverted in _These Words Are True and Faithful_. Ernie makes an off-color suggestion for what he expects Sam to do for the pizza delivery guy, but it ultimately doesn't happen.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_
    -   The show once plays this relatively straight, except that the man is a poet inspector.
    -   A different sketch has a milkman lured into the house. The woman leads him to a back room and locks him in; he turns around and discovers that there are about a dozen milkmen already there, at least two of whom are dead.
-   Sloan and Ellen on _Slings & Arrows_ meet this way. He shows up delivering flowers, notices that her chameleon is dehydrated and misgendered, then they have sex.
-   In the first episode of _Torchwood_, Gwen pretends to be delivering a pizza to get into the base, and the existing members break down laughing. Jack gives the script for if they hadn't, which sounds a lot like one of these scenes, stopping right before the actual offer of sex.
-   Tested by Chas of _The Chaser's War On Everything_.
-   Referenced in _Friends_ when Chandler and Joey have been watching too much porn:
    
    **Joey:** Woman pizza delivery guy comes over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!  
    **Chandler:** What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
    
-   _Coupling_
    -   Done once with Jane doinking a pizza delivery guy. On someone else's floor. It led to a pregnancy scare.
    -   Another episode has Sally talking about doing the repairman version.
-   _Smallville_ has a pizza boy get invited inside, and then get in a hot tub, only to be devoured by a sorority of female vampires.
-   An episode of _Hannah Montana_ has a kid-friendly example (as most of the characters are in their early teens). Jackson orders pizza for a movie night with his friend Cooper, only for Cooper's younger sister to be caught kissing the pizza delivery man. When the pizza delivery man asks for tips, Jackson snarks that he seemingly already got his "tips".
-   _Charmed_ does the exact same thing in an early episode of the show. A pizza boy is invited into a bachelorette party only to get eaten by the demonic bridesmaids. Amusingly enough, he was actually a stripper playing out this trope.
-   The sitcom _Blossom_ had an episode about a "mature" woman who would arrange for a new pizza boy's schedule to be filled with phony deliveries, so they could have some "private time." Who, incidentally, was named "Mrs. Robertson".
-   In her first appearance on _Chuck_, Carina calls Chuck to fix her computer when _she doesn't even have one_ solely to seduce him. Chuck, naturally, was intimated by her advances and said no.
-   _The Daily Show_
    -   Pizza has meant Ho Yay since Election Night 2004, when Jon and Stephen shared a slice (tragically, no Spaghetti Kiss) and when Stephen interviewed Representative Brad Sherman for _The Colbert Report_, somehow the interview turned into _Fresh Hot Slice_.
    -   Also, when the show covered the SEC porn scandal - employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission were downloading Internet porn, while they should've been focusing on preventing the financial crisis - Samantha Bee suggested that in order to make finances more interesting, all financial documents should be delivered via "hunky pizza delivery guys". At this point, a guy appears, delivering a document to Sam:
        
        **Sam:** Oh my goodness, who could that be? I didn't order a collateralized debt obligation! Ooh, it's so long!
        
-   Roz toys with this twice on _Frasier_.
    -   In one episode, she comments that she intends to go home, put on some sexy underwear, and rip out her sink so as to have an excuse to invite the sexy new building superintendent over.
    -   In another episode, she invites Bulldog, who is working as a pizza man, up to her bedroom, making him think she wants to sleep with him; when she, instead, locks him out on her balcony naked, he thinks she's trying to invoke this trope and knocks on the door, calling out, "Pizza man!".
-   _Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!_ parodied the Pizza Boy trope, having David Cross deliver a pizza directly into the women's locker room — but alas, no bread sticks. When the woman he was delivering it to decided to chow down on something else, she discovered the pizza boy was built like a Ken doll. Cross explained there were many ways for a man and woman to show their love besides intercourse, and proceeded to sing a song about buying heart-shaped balloons and sending love notes. He closed by explaining to guys that if their partners are pushing them to go too far, they can just say no.
-   Played for horror in a _MA Dtv_ sketch involving Diana Ross calling cable men to fix her cable. Her lustful attitude seems to indicate this, but the cable guys are terrified of her and try not to anger her by pointing out her fading celebrity or recently canceled tour. With good reason, as she ends up biting the nipple off of one of them, then _spitting it out onto the guy's boss hours later when he comes to fix the cable_.
-   _All That_ had an ever-so-slightly more family-friendly version of this trope: In one sketch based around three girls at a sleepover, the girls ordered a pizza, hoping for an attractive delivery boy, but instead got a young man decked out in Nerd Glasses and an awkward personality. At some point, after he left, one of the girls, an overtly stereotypical "goth" character who also appears to be a witch, introduced a potion that would make anyone who touched it fall in love with the first person they saw. They end up spilling it all over each other. Guess who walks back in?
-   Played for laughs in _The X-Files_ episode "Empedocles". Mulder is offended when Scully answers her door expecting to see someone else. A slip-of-the-tongue remark about waiting for the pizza guy is made, and of course Mulder runs with it.
    
    **Scully:** I was just about to jump in the shower, but I was waiting for the pizza man.  
    **Mulder:** You got something going on with the pizza guy I should know about?  
    **Scully:** The pizza man?  
    **Mulder:** Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but you did just say you were waiting for the pizza man to jump in the shower.
    
-   _Top Gear_ featured a lengthy gag about how presenter James May's idea of a porn film would have the boiler repairman meet the lonely housewife in her negligee and... repair the boiler.
    
    **James May:** Might do. What's wrong with that?
    
-   Called back to in an episode of _James May's Man Lab_, where May builds a home theatre and then shoots a film to show as his premiere which consists of a woman's boiler going out, a plumber coming to fix it, and her towel falling off while he is trying to work.
    
    _Rule 3: Do not distract the workman._
    
-   An episode of _Malcolm in the Middle_ subverts this, with Francis forcing a porn director to shoot the delivery man actually delivering food (and attempting to act, while thoroughly confused) so as not to offend the owners of the hotel where the shoot is taking place.
-   One episode of _CSI_ featured the murder of a clown who entertained at children's birthday parties, both the kids and the mothers.
-   The parcel delivery driver in the _CSI: Miami_ episode "Special Delivery" was having affairs with many of the housewives along his route. It was thought this might have been the reason he was murdered. It wasn't.
-   In _Glee_, Puck uses his job as a pool cleaner as an opportunity to service older women.
-   Referenced in _Supernatural_ in a funny moment:
    
    **Castiel:** It's very complex.  
    **Dean:** Mmm-hmm.  
    **Castiel:** If the pizza man truly loves this babysitter, why does he keep slapping her rear? Perhaps she's done something wrong.  
    **Dean:** You're watching porn? Why?  
    **Castiel:** It was there.
    
-   Subverted on _Pee-wee's Playhouse_ when Jimmy Smits, as the Authorized Conky Repairman is asked by Miss Yvonne if that's a wrench in his pocket, to which he responds, "Oh there it is."
-   Fiona Conway does this (literally with the pizza boy) in the _Midsomer Murders_ episode "Not in My Back Yard".
-   In one episode of _Six Feet Under_, David has spontaneous sex with a plumber in the morgue. Later, he tells his boyfriend Keith about it and warns him that he might have to talk about plumbing if he wants any action that night.
-   _Community_
    -   In episode "The Art of Discourse", Troy and Abed are discussing Porn Names when porn-esque bass music starts playing and a studly pizza delivery guy enters asking in a suggestive manner who ordered the pizza with "extra sausage" he has. As Troy and Abed exchange a glance and proceed to flee the room, the music stops and the camera cuts to Leonard with a bass guitar saying he ordered the pizza.
    -   The episode "Remedial Chaos Theory" features seven different timelines, each having a different character go downstairs to let the pizza guy in. In the timeline where Pierce is the one to go, he comes back with the pizza and says: "Man, pizza guys are getting worse and worse looking. Guess all the good ones went into porn."
    -   "Basic Crisis Room Decorum" has Chang attempt to discredit Greendale City College by filming a porn video there. The video's plot features Chang as a plumber. And nobody else.
-   Invoked on an episode of _QI_ when the panel was discussing the problems of sex in space. Bill Bailey and Alan Davies started musing about what a porno set in space would be like:
    
    **Bill Bailey:** I'm here to fix the turbo-thrusters.  
    **Alan Davies:** Then you'd better come through to the sleeping module.
    
-   An old _Late Night with Conan O'Brien_ skit showed Frankenstein doing a porno like this aside from appearing in _Van Helsing_.
-   _Goodness Gracious Me_ parodied the trope in a Chunky Lafanga sketch where he is exposed as having starred in a porn film where he played a milkman being seduced by a housewife.
-   Parodied in _Chewin' the Fat_ when Ronald, an actor who cannot remember simple lines or take any form of direction, is hired to voice over a foreign-language porno about a housewife seducing a plumber. He seems to be unaware that the film is porn, and thinks his character is an _actual_ plumber, and ad-libs lines asking why the woman is trying to have sex with him when he's only there to fix the sink.
-   The Danish satire show _Bertelsen og De Uaktuelle Nyheder_ provides parodies this trope. A Christian film director shows the "Christian" porno movie he has made, where in a woman calls a plumber to clean her pipes. The plumber then shows up and proceeds to... actually fix her faulty plumbing. Afterwards, they both sit down on a couch, where they suddenly feel sweaty and take off their jackets, at which point they both proceed to... decide they should marry each other.
-   In one episode of _Lucifer (2016)_, the title character Invokes this for a pizza delivery boy who shows up at his club mid-bacchanal, shoving the confused young man into a hot tub with a Blonde, Brunette, Redhead trio of Brittanys as soon as he admits the trope has never happened to him.
    
    **Delivery Boy:** But... I'm still on the clock...
    
-   On _My Name Is Earl_, it's revealed that Darnell back when he was known as Harry Munroe used to have a roommate. That roommate is now the warden at Camden's prison and married to the governor. He used to be a porn star and is shown filming a porn movie involving a cable guy in his and Darnell's shared apartment. Darnell is unfazed, but requests to put a cloth over his pet parrot's cage so he won't have to hear the parrot talking about it all night. The warden agrees to let Earl out of prison in exchange for Darnell keeping quiet about his past.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_: In the season 1 episode "Speak of the Devil," Matt makes a joke about this trope when he approaches Wilson Fisk's girlfriend at her art gallery on the pretense of seeking art for his apartment:
    
    **Matt Murdock:** I'm told by my guests my apartment's a bit stark. I thought maybe some art would warm it up.  
    **Vanessa Marianna:** I'm going to go out on a limb and assume these "guests" were women?  
    **Matt Murdock:** _\[laughs\]_ Well, I'm not trying to impress the pizza guy.
    
-   _The Neighborhood_: In “Welcome To Jury Duty”, Malcolm and Martin give up their home to an independent film crew for a few days, only to learn the crew is shooting a pornographic movie. Interestingly Malcolm is more displeased to learn they are using the standard “pizza boy” plot, considering it cliché.
-   _Jessica Jones (2015)_:
    -   The second season opens with Jessica being hired by the owner of a pizzeria to follow her boyfriend, who works for her as a deliveryman because he's been taking unusually long to return on some of his pizza deliveries. Jessica follows the boyfriend and catches him in the act of having a clandestine tryst with another woman on a delivery run. The owner then tries to hire Jessica to kill the boyfriend once she delivers her the evidence. Jessica proceeds to tell the guy about his boss's plans. And when the owner insists that Jessica is a killer (due to Trish mentioning Jessica killing Kilgrave on _Trish Talk_), Jessica throws an unclaimed pizza still on its metal plate, embedding it on the wall and states, "a heroine would denounce you for planned murder, a vigilante would beat the shit out of you for it! Choose which one you want me to be?" She then proceeds to steal a pizza yet to be delivered, and later enjoys it with Trish.
    -   In the very next episode, Pryce Cheng shows up at Jeri Hogarth's apartment while she's having an orgy with some hired hookers, because Jeri hasn't been returning his calls in light of learning about her recent ALS diagnosis.
        
        **Hooker:** You are not the pizza.  
        **Pryce Cheng:** And you're not Jeri.
        
-   One _The Late Show with Stephen Colbert_ episode taped right in the midst of the Stormy Daniels scandal opens with a skit parodying this trope, with Amy Rutberg (Marci Stahl from _Daredevil (2015)_) as Stormy.
-   The _Miami Vice_ episode "Heart of Darkness" begins on the set of a porn film about a girl who can't afford to get her air conditioner fixed.
    
    **Penny**: Maybe you could take a personal check?  
    **Repairman**: Well, that depends on how personal you want to make it.
    
-   _Without a Trace_'s Martin Fitzgerald uses a mild version of this to visit Samantha Spade at the motel room where she's working undercover. Although they don't have sex, he clearly wants to check up on her as his girlfriend rather than a fellow agent.
-   _Bliss_: There is an episode involving a piano tuner in a similar set up.
-   Referenced in one episode of _Two and a Half Men_. Alan is feeling down and Charlie calls over twins to cheer him up, but Alan turns down the offer. Later, he's watching a porn film and realizes that the twins are starring in it, and Charlie points out that if Adam had made the right choice, he'd now (metaphorically) be delivering a pizza to the twins, implying that the film follows this trope.
-   _The Twilight Zone (2002)_: Deconstructed in "The Pool Guy". The main character is a professional pool maintenance man, and he's more than aware of the "Rich MILF bangs the pool boy" scenario. So when someone's Trophy Wife comes on to him, he's just annoyed, pointing out that he's there to do a job, which really isn't anywhere as glamorous as going to mansions and scoring with hot women all day. It later turns out that he and the wife _did_ have some sort of sexual encounter (it's ambiguous whether she tried to seduce him and he refused, or he tried to score with her after misreading her signals), and he murdered her husband to get rid of him.
-   _Saturday Night Live_:
    
    -   One sketch takes place in a porn called "Skank Babysitter 17," in which a hunky delivery boy (Chance the Rapper) surprises a "college-aged" babysitter with a "large sausage" pizza. Before they can do anything with the "sausage," the babysitter's child client (Aidy Bryant) walks in. She doesn't know what's going on and is just excited to have pizza... though she's confused about the hole in the middle in the pie. At the end of the sketch, the babysitter also gets visits from a plumber, a handyman, and a man delivering a "package."
    -   A Deconstructive Parody stars JJ Watts as a delivery guy in a 1970s porno, working for "Big Willie's Pizza." His boss (Kenan Thompson) fires him because despite how many orders he delivers, his customers never actually pay for the pizza, he always spends an hour at one house, and he's exhausted as soon as he finishes a delivery. The delivery guy is disgusted to hear that his boss ate one of his pizzas (one that had a hole through the middle).
    
    **Boss**: There wasn't even any sausage on it!  
    **Delivery Guy**: Well, there _was_!
    
-   _Year Of The Rabbit_, set in Victorian London, features an Anachronism Stew parody. Rabbit watches a play at a theatre involving a fully-dressed housewife teasing a plumber by flashing a bit of ankle.

    Music 

-   This trope is used in "Telephone Man", a '70s novelty hit by Meri Wilson. And in her sequel, "Peter the Meter Reader." What makes it a sequel? The last line: "Peter used to be my telephone man."
-   Also invoked in "Jolly Tinker", by Boiled in Lead.
-   The charmingly coy "Super Orgy Porno Party" by the Planet Smashers starts with an audio clip from such a porno.
-   Adam Sandler's "At a Medium Pace" used this as one of the many, _many_ sex gags in the song.
-   "I've Got Some Outside Help I Don't Need" by B.B. King references this, among many other kinds of infidelity the singer suspects his wife of.
    
    _The iceman came by this morning,_
    
    _And you know he didn't leave no ice._
    
    _The postman came by later baby,_
    
    _And he didn't even ring twice._
    
-   In the music video for Meghan Trainor's "Dear Future Husband" one of the final scenes involves the singer receiving a Pizza boy in her house, and her pulling him in through his tie presumably for some "special loving".
-   Ivor Biggun's "Toolbag Ted from Birkenhead"
    
    _Ripping my missus's drawers out,_
    
    _Banging on the bedroom floor,_
    
    _He's Toolbag Ted from Birkenhead, the randy handyman_
    
    ''He walks in when I walk out,
    
    _Does a bloody sight better than ever I can._
    
-   Pornosonic, a band who's gimmick is that all of their songs are themes to non-existent porno films, have a song entitled "Special Delivery" (best known as the music used during the "Let Us Fuck" segment of Kevin Smith's podcast _Jay and Silent Bob Get Old_), alluding to this trope. A promo for their first album, staring famous porn actor Ron Jeremy, who also performs spoken-word sound bites on the album, starts as a spoof of these.

    Puppet Shows 

-   Subverted when _The Funday Pawpet Show_ cast interviewed Jeff the Pizza Guy. When asked if he is ever greeted at the door by naked women, Jeff said he _has_ been in the past (there is a nudist colony on his route), but they are generally not the women you'd want to live out this trope with.
-   _Puppets Who Kill_ has an interesting exchange:
    
    **Dan:** Trust me, it hurts me to tell you this, I would love to believe in a world where beautiful sultry women in gowns are shtupping the pizza boy. But. It. Just. Ain't. So.  
    **Cuddles:** When she said she wanted a lot of melted cheese...?  
    **Dan:** She meant melted cheese.  
    **Cuddles:** And, and when she said she wanted a stick of pepperoni...?  
    **Dan:** She wants pepperoni.  
    (_later, when it turns out she was a horny lady who just liked pizza boys_)  
    **Cuddles:** You mean Dan when she said she liked melted cheese...?  
    **Dan:** It meant she wanted to have sex with you.  
    **Cuddles:** And, and when she said she liked pepperoni...?  
    **Dan:** It meant she wanted to have sex with you.  
    **Cuddles:** And when she said she'd like to be taken roughly from behind?  
    **Dan:** It meant... Oh shut up and watch TV.
    
-   Parodied with sock puppets in _Socksual Innuendoes_. Strange men show up unannounced to the protagonist's house one after the other, all making such innuendo.

    Theatre 

-   In _Legally Blonde_, Kyle is a UPS Delivery guy who Paulette attempts to use the Bend and Snap on. Subverted in that she accidentally breaks his nose, but double subverted in that the two spend some... ahem... _quality time_ together in the emergency room.
-   Shows up in _Lysistrata_, as part of an Athenian commissioner's rant that the women have been overindulged: shoe-makers or jewelers come to the house while the husband is away, on some paper-thin pretense of fixing the wife's sandal or bracelet. That makes this one Older Than Feudalism.
-   In _A Streetcar Named Desire_, a young newspaper fee collector receives a sudden kiss from Blanche, for no reason that to further establish her ephebophilia.
-   Thanks to Adaptational Consent, _Wicked_ turns Elphaba's conception into this. Her unnamed mother had a fling with a traveling salesman who would later become the Wizard of Oz.

    Video Games 

-   The flash-game Trilogy Creep _Kerics Komplex_ features a restaurant that actually caters to this trope (obviously sex sells, but this is ridiculous). It also features elves, a hormone-crazed teenaged Stalker with a Crush, a Manly Gay who works in the aforementioned pizza delivery, and a rather obscene Government Conspiracy. The author also does Rule 34 Anime Fan Art and Furry Fandom art.
-   Later editions of _The Sims_ allow this by allowing you to form relationships with various members of the NPC hired help. Pizza delivery was just the tip of the iceberg of typical situations, which include gardeners, technicians, maids, firefighters, police officers, and even thieves (provided you got to a good start by letting them out of the cop car after they tried to steal your stuff). Who cares about the next job, just invite them in, slip into something a little more comfortable and let your charms do the talking. In the process of a day after moving into a new lot, a lone sim was living with the postal woman. A week later they married. Done right, things can move... quickly.
-   In the "A New Life" mission of _Hitman: Blood Money_, 47 can disguise himself as the pool boy so that he can be alone with the target's perpetually inebriated wife, who's wearing a necklace that contains evidence required to complete the mission. She invites him up to her room and if he does so... then changes her mind and falls asleep. 47 can use this opportunity to nick the necklace without resorting to violence.
-   _The Pizza Boy_ is this trope with a slight science-fiction angle.

    Web Animation 

-   Averted in a cartoon short called, _Michael the Terrible Boyfriend_: Michael's trying to figure out how to see his girlfriend without her parents knowing. Upon seeing a pizza delivery boy, he turns to the audience and says, "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" It then cuts to the girl's bedroom, where Michael _bursts through the window on a pterodactyl that then eats his girlfriend._
-   In a _Sailor Moon_ parody, the pizza boy is unfortunate enough to arrive just after all the Sailor Scouts have killed themselves without any good reason.
-   Subverted and Parodied in one _Cyanide and Happiness_ short that first appears to be building up towards an obvious subversion with both the girl and pizza delivery guy making plenty of overt sexual innuendos and double entrendes but then makes a typical Cyanide and Happiness swerve: The girl gets a pizza from _another_ pizza delivery boy and no coitus ensues since that guy is not in on the whole "special delivery" thing while the _real_ "special delivery" is delivered to the kids party across the street, the delivery addresses having been mistakenly switched up.
-   This is the basis of the plot of the infamous adult video game _Plumbers Don't Wear Ties_. Instead of meeting the girl on a job in the traditional manner, the game zig-zags the trope with a wild plot where the plumber meets a damsel in distress in the parking lot of an office building. The girl, Jane, is fleeing a job interview where the Bad Boss has chased her outside as she attempts to flee his attempts to rape her. They fall in love after John saves the day, but as the program was marketed under the cover of a video game, they are never seen having sex.
-   YouTube animator Serarel used the audio from a popular Vine (mentioned below in Web Original) in an animated clip with Legoshi and Juno from _Beastars._ For those familiar with Legoshi and Juno's relationship in the source material... its pretty spot on.

    Webcomics 

-   Mildly subverted in _It's Walky!_ where the Martians try to torture Joyce by making her experience the scenario through mind control. It doesn't work because she can't figure out what she's supposed to pay with if she doesn't have any money. Several strips later, Joe shows her a movie which exhibits the trope and the truth darn near breaks her.
-   Altair Anunnaki in _Suicide for Hire_:
-   _Faulty Logic_ gives us a peek into Fox's mind. It starts with Krystal's exclusion from _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_ and devolves into Fox (no relation) not knowing when to stop talking.
-   Made fun of multiple times by _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_:
    -   In one strip, a woman's porn watching is ruined once she starts dating a plumber.
    -   In another, a woman tries to do this, but the pizza guy doesn't go for it because he's an English major who objects to her use of metaphor.
-   A strip from _Sabrina Online_ suggests<small>◊</small> that Zig Zag's actors were shooting one of these videos while Sabrina's sister Tabitha was visiting... but only the first part.
-   Parodied in a strip from _xkcd_, which has a pizza boy, a plumber, and a French Maid showing up at the same time due to a scheduling mix-up. They eventually decide to forget the whole thing and play Agricola instead.
-   In _Fur Will Fly_ Roxxy is a pizza _girl_ who uses "unconventional" tactics to get bigger tips. Though the only one of her customers she actually slept with was her girlfriend, Natalie.
-   Parodied in _Insecticomics_. The Insecticons and company are pretending to have really loud sex to mess with a whiny, repressed G1 fanboy — in reality, they're just having a party. When the pizza girl comes over, they pay her extra to pretend to be doing this to mess with the kid's head even further.
-   Averted in banner ads for the webcomic _Blaster Nation_. The two-panel ads show a half-dressed Rinnie telling a pizza delivery man she doesn't have any cash and asking if she can pay some other way. The second panel shows her writing the guy a check.
-   Averted in _Questionable Content_; when Hannelore realizes she doesn't have enough money to tip Dale for delivering a pizza, she invites him in for some other kind of tip, which he accepts reluctantly... only to find that she just wanted to let him have some of the pizza. Hanners is mortified to learn what Dale _thought_ she meant.
-   _Pv P_ once presented the panda equivalent of this trope.
-   Parodied in _Nerf NOW!!_, with Samus Aran wearing a skimpy nightie over her Zero suit.
-   A pornographic _Pokémon_ webcomic series by the artist Winick-Lim involves a _male_ Braixen (named Chris) sleeping with the mailman (a Zoroark named Zack). But neither is cheating on anyone; the affair actually goes on for a couple of days until the former's caught by his mother when he's in the middle of the act.

    Web Original 

-   Parodied in this _CollegeHumor_ video, where the trope plays out with a gas company guy coming to the house to check for a gas leak. After doing the deed, he then dies in bed of carbon monoxide poisoning. Then the trope rinses and repeats when a guy from the coroner's office shows up to collect the body.
-   Also from College Humor, this one does it with a "cable repair" guy.
-   Among the works of bloodninja is a subversion of this trope, as he makes the "special delivery" in the pizza.
-   Apparently, there's a porn website named "Big Sausage Pizza" (which as discussed in the link there, has a really stupid premise).
-   Played with in an older _SMBC Theater_ skit — he actually _is_ a plumber, but pretends to be a porn star as he fixes some leaky pipes.
-   This _Game of Thrones_ spoof where Daenerys and her handmaidens have their way with a Dothraki pizza guy.
-   One story on _FML_ has a pizza guy constantly having to put up with this from fat chicks with body acne.
-   One episode of _Camp Camp_ has the kids visiting the city and stumbling upon a film set, where one of the characters is a pizza boy and the other is "Anita Johnson", who's directed to redo her dialogue with "more cleavage".
-   In this vine, Subverted.
    
    **Man:** _(Holding pizza box close to his crotch)_ Did somebody order a baked sausage pizza?
    
    **Woman:** _(Winking coyly)_ I did, but I don't have any money.
    
    **Man:** _(Leaving)_ Why the fuck did you order—?
    
-   Among other erotic art settings that use the trope is Gats' Pizza Thot, a chain of pizza places that outright advertise their "special deliveries" as this trope. They even have an option for actually sending pizza with your order.
-   _The Onion_ gives this a modern update with Frisky Housewife Lets Revealing Robe Slip After Opening Door To Amazon Delivery Drone.
-   Parodied and subverted in the _Thomas Sanders_ video "My Life With A Narrator":
    
    **Pizza Delivery Guy:** Oops, I seem to have forgotten your pizza. \*throws empty pizza box away\* Is there anything I can do to... \*does a sexy pose\* make it up to you?
    
    **Thomas:** \*annoyed\* Yeah, refund my order. Thank you.
    
-   Parodied and subverted in this Porta dos Fundos video, where Carlos, the new pizza deliverer, discovers he can't do anything more with his clients than deliver pizza.
-   Parodied in this video, where the plumber is only interested in his work and the woman's come-ons keep suffering from Entendre Failure.
    
    **Woman:** Maybe if you take care of my pipes, _I_ can take care of _your_ pipe.  
    **Plumber:** ...Ma'am, I do my own plumbing.
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Robot Chicken_:
    -   Parodied, with Conan O'Brien playing an inept pizza boy who didn't realize that his customers were hitting on him.
        
        _He's Randy, the oblivious pizza delivery guy._
        
    -   Also happens in a "Frankenstein Wastes a Minute of Our Time" skit when Conan asks Frankenstein if he did any other films that year aside from _Van Helsing_.
    -   And again on another episode which is more a parody of screwed-up cable porn. While you can't see anything, a situation like this plays out with a Pizza Guy, then a Plumber, and a Pool-Cleaner end up in a massive orgy, and in the end, the first guy goes "Seriously, somebody has to pay for this pizza."
        
        "Oh~! We're all having sex~! With each other~!"
        
    -   One sketch has one of the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ attempt this, which thoroughly freaks out the delivery boy and causes him to leave without _any_ payment. The others come out and compliment him on his free pizza strategy, but it turns out he was genuinely hoping to find a relationship, and this is apparently the only way he knows how.
-   Subverted in an episode of _The Critic_. A young, Fabio-looking grocery delivery boy makes a stop at the elderly Mrs. Sherman's home, and proceeds to accidentally tear his shirt off on a nail (leaving only a Chippendale collar), ask where he can put his "hot buns", spill cooking oil over himself, and rub his hands over his torso to try and clean it off, all in rapid succession. While sexy dance music plays on the radio he accidentally turned on. Despite his efforts, Mrs. Sherman pays no attention to him and eventually pushes him out the door. Made even funnier due to the fact her friend suggested earlier to have an affair with a younger man since her own love life was lacking.
-   Parodied in _The Simpsons_ where Selma is indicated to have called out a TV repairman solely for the purpose of this trope. The door is slammed on the scene just as the repairman realises that the TV isn't broken, just unplugged.
-   There is an episode of _Rocko's Modern Life_ where Mrs. Bighead repeatedly calls Rocko over with things to fix trying to attempt the act as it were.
-   Parodied in _American Dad!_, where Roger is paid to write a porno script but is criticized for using pizza boys and pool boys, something which is seen as outdated. When he attempts to write another one, he uses a "pool boy/pizza delivery boy", which is immediately shot down by Steve. At one point, Steve suggests an updated scenario involving an IT support guy, which Roger's producer endorses, but ends up turning in a hard sci-fi script (which includes fifty pages of an orgy rocket refueling).
-   In _Family Guy_, one episode involves the porn film "Quest for Fur" that Lois Griffin acted in when she was younger. At the end of the episode, the film is shown and features a pizza delivery boy that strongly resembles Stewie Griffin (who had been worried about being conceived during the filming of the porno). All this, despite the film being about cavemen.
    
    **Stewie:** Now I'm really getting suspicious.  
    **Pizza delivery boy:** Did somebody order a pizza?
    
    -   In another episode Peter believes he's going to have an orgy with Lois and a couple of her friends. He then settles a few porn scenarios, the first of which is Peter the pizza boy delivering a pizza for a sorority house.
    -   And then there's the time when a program about how to extend life in canines is interrupted for "several episodes of _One Day At A Time_." (Brian is increasingly desperate to cut the power to the TV.)
        
        **Ann:** Dammit Schneider, I asked you to fix that damn sink two days ago!
        
        **Schneider:** Oh, I'll fix your sink Miss Romano. And by "fix your sink", I mean I'll have sex with you. And by "have sex with you", I mean I'll fix your sink. And by "sink", I mean your reproductive organ. And by "reproductive organ", I mean the thing between your knees. And by "the thing between your knees"... I guess that one's kinda self explanatory.
        
-   In the _South Park_ episode "Insecurity," the town's men suspect the UPS man (who appears innocent of any wrongdoing) of sleeping with their wives. Things... do not go well for the hapless delivery man after that.
-   In a G-rated version of this trope, the _Sonic Boom_ episode "Three Minutes or Less" has Sonic work as a delivery boy. One scene has Amy order a meal as an opportunity to set up a romantic dinner with him.
-   One episode of _Big Mouth_ has Nick watching one of these pornos, complete with a Ron Jeremy look-alike. It's Played for Laughs, as the pizza boy admits that he already ate the pizza and his co-star tells him to not burp into her vagina.
