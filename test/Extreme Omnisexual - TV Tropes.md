**Howard:** Jack just ate a happy ending!  
**Kreese:** Don't you mean Happy Onion?  
**Howard:** Clearly you've never had sex with an onion!

This is a character who would, could, or has bedded _anything_. By "anything" we mean _absolutely anything_, up to and including **the bed itself**.

The Extreme Omnisexual isn't necessarily limited to chasing after humans or humanoids; targets of their affections can also include other species, robots, or even animals and inanimate objects.

This person is often a Lovable Sex Maniac, a depraved villain or is just really, _really_ desperate.

Constrast Celibate Hero. See also Really Gets Around for the restricted to humans (or at most to humanoids) and usually-straight version. Compare Extreme Omnivore (the dietary counterpart).

    Anime & Manga 

-   Besides being a Depraved Bisexual, Anri of _Adekan_ also shows attraction to a male panda in one extra chapter. He's actually called this in the manga as well by two other characters.
-   _Black Butler_: Grell Sutcliff. She's is a chainsaw-wielding Transgender Dark Action Girl that is very forward about her attraction to Sebastian, within the same five minutes talking about both wanting to cut him into pieces and being the mother of his child. Her affections are not just limited to Sebastian; in general, she loves to flirt with anyone that takes her fancy so long as they are good looking, badass, and sadistic enough. For example, with William Spears and the Undertaker, she seems enamored by William's way of directing violence towards her and asks Undertaker to "make love with me" after she sees his pretty eyes and calls him good looking in the manga. She also expresses attraction towards Pluto both when he's in his human male form and dog form, Agni (in the Hamlet OVA), Alois (in the second season), and Kirito (in the first musical). She also initially fell in love with Madame Red due to her way of killing prostitutes and later killed her, and once commented that she thought Alois's Ninja Maid Hannah Anafeloz had a cute/pretty face — before stabbing her.
-   Ryusui Nanami from _Dr. STONE_ Has a Type when it comes to women... and that type is _every single woman in the world_. He also mentions being into men a few time. This fits his All-Loving Hero nature, as well as his Greed (which is treated as a positive quality by the narrative).
    
    **Ryusui:** I love all women, you see, so naturally that includes you. Men too!! I desire them all!!
    
-   Gantz:
    -   Kazuo Kuwabara will screw anything with a wet hole, to include _literally_ fucking Nurarihyon in the face when it became a giant woman composed of naked women.
    -   A Gantzer gets it on with a Giant in chapter 368. And then his friends from the British team kill the Giant when she throws the guy off for ejaculating in her.
-   Reiko of _Golden Boy_ is into men but after finding them not strong enough for her liking took to using her motorcycle to get off and acted like she was having sex with it. She even called it the only man for her.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    -   France is frequently shown molesting other countries, be they male or female (more the former than the latter, but probably only because almost every character on the show is a male), and not even being shot to the head by one of his victims will stop him. The author himself even mentions that France is attracted to beautiful men, women, "and even some non-humans." And he is not one bit picky about the age...
    -   Hungary shows shades of this as well. She's a Yaoi Fangirl who will coo at the sight of two little boys getting affectionate, drool at her husband getting molested, and also has a thing for Bara (she was upset when something "rosy" did not involve manly men making out) and she's been shown to get the Cuteness Proximity over cute girls too, as well as flirt with more mature women like Ukraine.
-   The Main Characters of the famously controversial _Interspecies Reviewers_ series take this trope to its logical extreme and beyond.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Sanji when comes to the female sex absolutely does not discriminate no matter what species, as he’s shown attraction to Fish-Women, female Minks (animal people), Giantesses, dinosaur-hybrid women (as seen Ulti) and female robots like Lilith. One cover spread depicts him being okay with female zombies gnawing him. He draws the line at very young girls and his own ironically very hot sister Reiju though and doesn’t appear to be attracted to men, barring some Ho Yay with Zoro.
    -   Big Mom has slept with numerous men from many different races (Long-Leg race, Long-Arm race, Three-Eyed race, Fish-Men and Dwarves) giving birth to 85 children. She definitely wanted to add Giants and Lunarins to that but never got the chance. It does help that she was incredibly attractive when she was younger.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ features _many_ of those, including Chuck, Panty, and Garter.
-   _Popee the Performer_: According to Word of Gay, Papi's sexuality is "everything in this world".
-   In the _Seraph of the End_ Light Novel _The Story of Vampire Mikaela_, Victor Roleine is this and is also Ambiguously Bi.
-   _Space☆Dandy_'s Dandy seems to fit this trope quite well, although he does seem to draw the line somewhere. Exactly where that line lies is a little unclear.
-   Swordfish from the yaoi manga _Under Grand Hotel_. As one inmate put it: "he's just a crazy bisexual homophobe that likes guys" and is obsessed with Sen. Also at one point Swordfish warns Sen that he better make sure he doesn't die while in prison because if he does he'll rape his corpse in full view of everyone.
-   _Yuureitou_: Marube. To start, Marube was in love with Tetsuo's real mother Onatsu. Now, he lusts after his biological child Tetsuo because of his great resemblance to her. Later we find out he wants to have a Brain Transplant with Tetsuo so he can "become" Onatsu and have sex with his own body. Not only that, if the surgery succeeds he plans to have child with Tetsuo so he can switch brains with his own children over and over again and thus create an "eternal love" with Onatsu by forever living on in a body with both her and his blood. Also, he has harassed and touched Taichi inappropriately when he was Disguised in Drag and when he was dressed normally as a guy, sexually abused his adopted daughter, and tried to sleep with his biological son. He later attempts to rape Taichi in order to drive him away from Tetsuo and is shown kissing and trying to sleep with the bones of his dead wife.

    Comic Books 

-   _Fables_: Played literally by Goldilocks. She admits to Bluebeard that she's no speciesist, and that she's open in having sex with any living being, and that included sleeping with Baby Boo Bear and a goblin butler.
-   _Deadpool_: Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, fits this trope, according to Word of God regarding his sex life. He hasn't slept with animals. But he seems to be open to anything else. Some of his relationships and sexcapades include regular women, other mutants, giant space aliens, demon queens / vampires, and the personification of Death herself. He has shown to flirt with other men, but thus far we haven't seen him actually date or sleep with a man yet.
    -   In _Spider-Man/Deadpool_, Deadpool reveals that while he's married, he has a free-pass list that his wife approved and signed years ago. Spider-Man was on his list.
    -   Spider-Man was also revealed to be his "heartmate." These student witches tried to summon his wife so they could use her body as a vessel for the revival of their mistress. They draw blood from Deadpool, to perform a spell which will bring forth his heartmate, who was assumed to be his wife, Shiklah. But she's not the one who appeared.
-   In _Hellblazer_, the Archangel Gabriel is no stranger to this. Among those he bedded and raped are the Virgin Mary (resulting in you know _who_) and a disguised succubus.
    -   Speaking of succubi, Eli has the powers of seduction for being one, which she used to seduce angels and a Vatican priest rather easily.
-   De Sade from _Preacher_ is presented an armadillo from the local zoo, as he's already sodomized every single other animal they have there, said to have "buggered his way through \[most of the large mammals\]". This is not played exclusively for comedy. He includes children in that list. His Gomorreans (all bored and depraved rich people) are just as licentious, from generously offering to use a cucumber on passersby (Tulip does not take this well) to getting their privates stomped on by sheep to pedophilia (Jesse does not take that well).
    -   From the same series, those two gay detectives, used either as Plucky Comic Relief or take thats.
    -   T.C. primarily focuses on animals of either gender, and is said to have had sex with a cake.
-   Tex Porneau and Anders Klimakks in _The Filth_: the former will try to have sex with anyone who comes to his door, has the motto "Fuck Or Be Fucked", and eventually creates a species of giant sperm so that he can lay THE ENTIRE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. The latter is a porn star/bio-engineered sex god whose black semen can impregnate anyone and whose record for women slept with is approaching the 900 mark.
-   _Transmetropolitan_ brings us the following epitaph on a sidewalk:
    
    **Spider Jerusalem:** "The Last Stand of Thierry Ngyuen, The Demon Whoremonger of Rangoon and satisfier of over Ten Thousand women, and Five Hundred Ninety Two men and Three Thousand Two Hundred and Five Zoological specimens and Eight Hundred things we're not sure about. Died laughing of explosive scrotal failure on this spot while pleasuring eighteen porn starlets, all of whom later committed suicide in grief." I still miss your columns, Thierry.
    
    -   Less flatteringly, Fred Christ.
        
        **Spider Jerusalem:** For fuck's sake, Fred. I swear you'd stick it in mud if you thought it'd wiggle.
        
-   _Bomb Queen_, who has stated she will have sex with pretty much anything, regardless of gender, age, species, legality, etc.
-   Tek Knight from _The Boys_ suddenly began having (and following through with) sexual urges towards a great deal of things including a telepathic android, a chinchilla, a meteorite, a cup of coffee and a Captain Ersatz of Catwoman named Talon. Turned out to be a symptom of a massive brain tumor.
-   Namor the _Sub-Mariner_, the King of Atlantis, beds a monstrous aquatic creature queen (sort of a hybrid of a sea-worm, squid and xenomorph) in an _Uncanny X-Men_ story, in order to secure a peace treaty between their peoples. He sees absolutely nothing at all perturbing about this encounter, and dismisses Hope's negative opinion as prejudiced and parochial. This is not the first time Namor has solved a problem this way. The only exception to his complete lack of standards is that he turns down Hope remarkably gently for someone with his brusqueness when she awkwardly hits on him immediately after because she is underaged. And, supposedly, he does not like redheads. (Though the redhead thing was likely a joke to tease Hope. Namor's had redheaded love interests before, most prominently his late-wife Dorma.)
-   Modern depictions of Starfox from _The Avengers_ tend to paint him as this, with _Thanos_ #1 even showing him in an orgy with aliens of various genders and species.
-   Thanos himself as seen in his origin _Thanos Rising_ has slept with hundreds of alien women of various different species across the universe. He’s also slept with at least one goddess: Hela as well as a Anthropomorphic Personification: Death.

    Fan Works 

-   In Lanipator's second episode of _Abrigimon_, Tai is not above trying to seduce any female, be it Sora, Kari or even _Gabumon_.
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: The Tales of Keeper Mercury's depravity are the stuff of legend. Features this as a running gag. Actually _averted_, but try telling anyone that...
-   _Dirty Potter_: _Absolutely every single character_, regardless of age, gender, blood relation, species, or _sentience_.
    
    **Ron.** Hagrid'll fuck anything if it stands still long enough, eh?
    
-   _Chemistry_: Played for Drama and deconstructed. Cadance being a Goddess of Love comes with a natural attraction to others. It's a medical condition she's had since she was a teenager.
-   _From Bajor to the Black_: Eleya's roommate at Starfleet Academy, Jasmine "Jazz" Velasquez. She goes for both male and female (at least once both at the same time), non-cadets as often as not, species other than human _more_ often than not, and rarely the same partner twice.
-   _The Life and Times of a Winning Pony_: Cloud Kicker. Also an Ethical Slut.
-   Prince Haiba from "The Lion King Adventures" is the embodiment of this trope. He has crushes on both Simba and Nala (to the point of kissing them in their sleep), constantly tries to win Sarafina's affections, and can often be found making out with bushes or rivers.
-   Sebastian mentions his father as this in _Mabel in Butterhurst_. At first he says that his father's goal was to bed every woman in Butterhurst, but then changes it to "everything", remembering rumors about his father and 'a few animals'.
-   In the comedic-yet insane _MLP_ fanfic _MLP: FML_, we get Rainbow Dash, who'll do anyone and anything, from Spike to...Granny Smith.
-   Alex Vaughn from _The Terminators: Army of Legend_ series of fanfics.
-   In _Final Fantasy VII: Machinabridged_, being the subject of Dr. Hojo's breeding experiments has evidently left its mark on Red XIII. His response to some sort of motorcycle monster is "I'm gonna f\*\*\* it," and when Cloud tells a story about a horrifying Jenova mutant, Red asks "was it hot?"
-   _The Bolt Chronicles_: Implied about Blaze in "The Cameo." He refers to himself as being "trisexual," meaning he'll try anything once — except have sex with cats, apparently.
-   _Hivefled_: Eridan had a phase of this in a ill-thought-out attempt to 'get over' his own Asexual asexuality. The Condesce and Grand Highblood are somewhat Squickier examples. Well, it's really more like 'anything that moves and some things that don't', in the latter's case.
-   Moonthistle from _Whispers_ is willing to hit on _anyone_, be they married or single, male or female, a complete stranger or her _best friend_.
-   Amaterasu from _Infinity_ displays varying levels of attraction to Arf, Signum, Chrono, Nanoha, Fate Yuuno, and... er... both of her own siblings.

    Films - Animated 

-   _Fritz the Cat_: The title character, Fritz. If he's not thinking of getting stoned or thinking of himself as some bold intellectual genius, he's thinking of (or actively having) sex. His romantic conquests include a trio of college girls, a heavy-set crow woman and a horse nun.
-   _Heavy Metal_: The space pirate captain Lincoln F. Stern. Not only has he been charged with a whopping _thirty-seven_ counts of rape, but it's also said that he ran a _child prostitution ring._

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Cheech & Chong's _The Corsican Brothers_ actually refers to this trope as a TRYsexual.
    
    **Cheech:** No, a trysexual, he'll try anything: mud, chickens, anything.
    
-   The Fat Idiot in _Famine_ has sex with a chocolate pastry, and mentions he once raped a girl's cat while spying on her changing.
-   _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_: Implied with Einhorn. When Ace outs Einhorn as a trans woman, every cop in attendance begins spitting in disgust because she made out with them. That includes at least one female cop and Snowflake who is a _dolphin_.
-   _Thor: Ragnarok_: The Grandmaster is an alien entity who is millions of years old, owns an orgy ship, and regularly hosts guests on his planet who are multiple different alien species. He also hits on Thor even though he doesn't know what gender he is, and seems to be attracted to Thor's brother, Loki.
-   Hansel from _Zoolander_: by the time of _Zoolander 2_, he's in a long-term relationship with an orgy involving multiple women, several men, Kiefer Sutherland and a goat, all of whom he somehow manages to impregnate. He then cheats on the first orgy with a second orgy whose participants include Susan Sarandon, a chicken and a hippopotamus.
-   _Art of the Dead_: Gina seems like a chaste, straight and Happily Married woman, but under the effects of Lust she starts lusting after anyone and anything, including Kim—her son's girlfriend—_her own daughter_.
-   The titular character in _Vixen_ says she'll have sex with anyone except black people and the disabled. She even has sex with her own brother.

    Jokes 

-   This old joke:
    
    **Airport Official:** Your name, sir?  
    **Immigrant:** Abdul Al Razhib.  
    **A.O.:** Sex?  
    **Immigrant:** Three to five times a week.  
    **A.O.:** No, no, I mean: male or female?  
    **Immigrant:** Yes... male, female, sometimes camel.  
    **A.O.:** Holy cow!  
    **Immigrant:** Yes... cow, dog, even sheep.  
    **A.O.:** But isn't that hostile?  
    **Immigrant:** Horse style, doggy style, any style!  
    **A.O.:** Oh dear!  
    **Immigrant:** No, no... deer run too fast!
    
-   Emo Phillips said "My schoolmates would make love to anything that moved, but I never saw any reason to limit myself."

    Literature 

-   Aogami Pierce from _A Certain Magical Index_ because of his enormous, but non-exhaustive list of tropes/fetishes he finds stimulating (see quotes section). It ends with a succinct "…any female is within my area of acceptance."
-   In _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ (set in 1943-4), Holly Golightly advocates this behavior:
    
    **Holly:** I'd settle for \[Greta\] Garbo any day. Why not? A person ought to be able to marry men or women or— listen, if you came to me and said you wanted to hitch up with a Man o' War, I'd respect your feeling. No, I'm serious. Love should be allowed. I'm all for it. Now that I know what it is.
    
-   Probably describes a large portion of the human population of the world of _Cerberon_, considering the number and variety of Half Human Hybrids encountered. George, from Regency England, might also qualify, as he's shamelessly attracted to a centauress.
-   In Tanya Huff's _Confederation of Valor_ series, Taykan in the di' phase are the most enthusiastically undiscriminating species in the known galaxy, and will gladly sleep with anyone they see. However, once their pheromone masker comes off, so does any choice on the other side. It goes to the point that a simple "Fuck you!" becomes an offer.
-   _Count to the Eschaton_: Nymph culture was based on sexual intercourse. They have words according to how often they copulate with someone—and no word at all for someone they haven't copulated with at all—especially since a formal greeting is an invitation to sexual intercourse. Normally, a man's first intercourse is with his mother. All partners appear to be human by some standard—though the extent of bioengineering makes it a very loose standard. (There are some people who do not fit. They are given a chance to cryogenically sleep until they are needed.)
-   Greebo in the _Discworld_ novels has been noted to give his amorous attentions to female members of species other than his own (cats), including several that should by all rights have some degree of say in the matter, such as wolves. Judging by his actions (and the reactions of other people) when he's temporarily transformed into a human, it's implied that he may just be _that good_ at it.
-   _Doctor Who New Adventures_:
    -   When Bernice Summerfield first gets together with future husband Jason Kane in _Death and Diplomacy_, they discuss their sex lives. Jason starts out saying that since he was taken halfway across the galaxy at the age of 15 and hasn't seen another human since, he doesn't know much about it... before listing 11 women and 5 men. And then it turns out not seeing another human didn't even slow him down.
        
        **Jason:** So anyway, then there was Rana, who was humanoid but more or less androgynous, and then I met Liva, who wasn't humanoid but was what you might call _definitively_ female; that was before Sali, of course...
        
    -   In a much later appearance, he's temporarily become an _extremely_ best-selling author; he set out to write his memoirs, but the publishers cut out the bits with his ex-wife in them and marketed the book as porn.
-   Gauron of _Full Metal Panic!_. It's pretty much canon that he raped the twins he adopted (who are female in the anime/manga and male in the novels), along with his perverted and obsessive love for Sousuke who he's had a thing for since the latter was eleven years old. He also revealed to Sousuke in the novels that he had always wanted to kill him and rape his corpse and he pretty much gets aroused while telling Sousuke this. Basically, the fandom is of the opinion that he would rape anyone. For kicks. Though the fandom is more justified in his case, considering how every single interaction he has with anyone has rapist vibes to it. He is also shown to get sexual arousal from violently cutting up and killing people as well as choking them.
-   Rika from _Haganai_ is a robosexual fujoshi that has also toyed with Yozora and Kodaka, among others.
-   Harry Coin from the _Illuminatus!_ trilogy claims to be willing to have sex with anything that moves and a few things that don't. His first appearance in the story involves him trying to Prison Rape George Dorn, and threatening to rape his corpse if he didn't submit willingly. Later on he does a Heel–Face Turn and joins the good guys, and explains that the weird sex acts cause him to see pure white light, implying that he achieved a partial illumination through them!
-   _Kyo Kara Maoh!_: Conrad was already likely bisexual given his history with Julia and present interactions with Yuuri and Jozak, but then it's also revealed in the manga that he once dated a woman who was a _"reverse mermaid"._ Yuuri even lampshades this with a joke about how wide Conrad's "strike range" is.
-   Hapsiel from _Magician's Academy_. Invulnerable and undefeatable, anyone or anything who gets near him, be it a cute little girl or a ravenous werewolf, is going to walk away with nothing less than a giant hickey. His appearance is always accompanied by a modification of the Flash Gordon music.
-   _Magic University_: The Esoterics have this as their job qualification, as it requires them to be able to have sex with everyone for ritualistic proposes. It eventually gets deconstructed by the relationship between Dean Bell and Master Brandish: while he is capable of having sex with women for professional reasons, he isn't actually attracted to them, and after Brandish transitions to female, they can't keep their relationship going, and he becomes so traumatized that he quits Esoterics and becomes a Blood Mage, who are essentially celibate.
-   Magnus Bane from _The Mortal Instruments_ and _The Infernal Devices_ has been with men, women, warlocks, vampires, humans, fey, and the occasional djinn, which does show that he does go for anything. Except mermaids. They smell like seaweed.
-   The Lady Faire, from the _Secret Histories_, was a male/female merged creation _designed_ to be this by Baron Frankenstein. The annual Ball s/he throws for his/her numerous ex-lovers is attended by men, women, elves, demons, aliens, robots, assorted humanoid or not-so-humanoid fantastic creatures, and even the Living Shroud, who doesn't seem corporeal enough to _have_ sex.
-   In the novelization of _Star Trek (2009)_, there's a scene where Uhura tells Gaila about Kirk's sexual reputation, mentioning that "some of them weren't even humanoid!" Kirk's response is that they were _all_ humanoid… he thinks.
-   Elliot from the web novel _The Turn of the Story_ is a mild version of this. He doesn't hit on everyone, but he's open-minded about potential romantic/sexual partners and _extremely_ comfortable with fantastical cross-species flings, much to the bafflement of his friends.
    
    **Luke:** Oh, my God. Don't tell me you would let one of those creatures touch you!
    
-   In _The Tyrant's Tomb_, the fourth installment to _The Trials of Apollo_, the eponymous Greco-Roman god admits that he "had spoken of love to women before. And men. And gods. And nymphs. And the occasional attractive statue before I realized it was a statue."
-   The protagonist in _The War Against the Chtorr_ has this to say about an incidental character.
    
    Clayton Jones—big and beefy; he'd been a college football star or something. He was always grinning and slapping people on the back, and fucking everything that moved or even looked like it was capable of movement or had maybe thought about moving once.
    
    -   Jim McCarthy himself becomes this during the time he spends with a cult.
-   _White Jazz_: Wardell Henry Knox. Another character remarks that "he'd fuck a woodpile on the off chance that there was a snake in it".
-   In _The Witcher_ novels and games, sorcerers and sorceresses tend to be this way, due to a combination of their magic enhancing their libidos, as well as making them sterile, and also making them extremely long-lived. As a result, strong magic-users tend to go through cycles of rabid sexuality, including with the same sex and more unusual partners, all in an effort to have new experiences and relieve boredom. Most wizards and sorceresses thus have infamous and storied love lives.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Blackadder II_: The Baby-eating Bishop of Bath and Wells.
    
    **Bishop:** You see, I am a colossal pervert. No form of sexual depravity is too low for me. Animal, vegetable or mineral—I'll _do_ anything _to_ anything.  
    **Blackadder:** Fine words for a bishop. Nice to hear the church speaking out for a change on social issues.
    
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Doctor themself, with varying levels of this depending on the regeneration. They've flirted with a sentient tree and a Dalek (albeit one with the consciousness of a cute human girl), they're bonded with their sapient spaceship to the point where the show calls her their wife and they call her Sexy, and they note that although they find Zygons physically repugnant, they're surprisingly good kissers.
    -   The episode "The Empty Child" introduces Captain Jack Harkness, a rogue time agent from the 51st century. When describing him to Rose, the Doctor explains in a Hurricane of Euphemisms that people from Jack's time are a bit more flexible when it comes to "dancing", with the classic observation, "So many species, so little time." Over his multi-season appearances on the series, Jack flirts or makes out with males, females, aliens, and androids. In fact, he provides the TV show's first male-on-male kiss when he snogs the Doctor in "The Parting of the Ways".
        -   _Torchwood_ — Captain Jack's Hotter and Sexier spinoff from _Doctor Who_ — pushes this trope to its natural limit.
        -   Jack himself, same as ever. Though he does eventually get in a committed relationship with a human man.
            
            **Gwen:** Have you ever eaten alien meat?  
            **Jack:** Sure.  
            **Gwen:** What was it like?  
            **Jack:** He seemed to enjoy it.
            
        -   There's also Captain Jack's ex-boyfriend, John Hart.
            
            **Capt. John:** _\[eager\]_ Oh, that's _gorgeous!_  
            **Gwen:** That's a poodle.
            
    -   Professor River Song, who appears from the fourth season onward, is a Downplayed version, casually stating that she's dated androids and a guy made of plastic. Word of God states that she's attracted to all genders. Becomes Really Gets Around during her run-in with the 12th Doctor, where she reveals she's currently married to 5 people and has over a dozen ex-husbands and -wives. Averted in that many of them were actually just steps in her plan as The Chessmaster to kill King Hydroflax, and she admitted that there was one person she really loved (the Doctor) while the rest were part of her ploy. Or maybe semi-averted, since she also hinted she enjoyed the "variety" available to her.
-   _Scrubs_: The Todd "appreciates hotness, regardless of gender" and "accepts all applicants, regardless of age or disability". And if he can't find a bedmate to do it with, he'll just _do it with the bed itself_. And then _cheat on it with other beds_.
    
    **The Todd:** Sometimes when I'm banging _this_ mattress, I'm thinking about banging _that_ one.
    
-   _Sex and the City_: Samantha also used the trysexual line.
-   _Sons of Anarchy_: Tig. Women, drag queens, horses, the _dead_, you name it.
-   _Star Trek:_
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_: William Shatner has joked that Kirk's list of sexual prerequisites did not necessarily include "humanoid." Well, if anyone can figure out how to score a bodiless Energy Being it would be James Tiberius Kirk.
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: Jonathan Frakes joked that Riker was "Try-sexual" as in "He'll try anything once!" One of Riker's most intense on-screen relationships was with a member of a genderless species.
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_
        -   Intendant Kira from the mirror universe. She even tries to seduce herself (well, her mirror self) at one point.
            
            **Nana Visitor:** When she meets Kira, she falls in love with Kira. My intention always was that it was pure narcissism. Here was simply someone who looked like her, it had nothing to do with being a woman. But in subsequent episodes, it became, you know, it just didn't matter. I assume lizards would have been all right with her too.
            
        -   Jadzia Dax. Besides her assorted on-screen liaisons, there's a running gag about her being attracted to aliens who aren't even particularly humanoid. (Morn actually _turned her down._)
            
            **Dax**: I'm having dinner with Captain Boday.  
            **Kira**: The Gallamite? You're going out on a date with him?  
            **Dax**: Is something wrong with that?  
            **Kira**: No, not at all.  
            **Dax**: He happens to be brilliant. His brain is twice the size of yours and mine.  
            **Kira**: I know. I've seen it.
            
        -   According to Wordof God of actor Andrew Robinson, Garak was meant to be omnisexual, hence his flirtation with Doctor Bashir in his first episode.
            
            **One interview:** I think that he was multisexual, essentially that anything that moves is fair game for Garak. He has a voracious sexual appetite.  
            **Another interview:** I can't speak for the sexuality of the character of Dr. Bashir, but I can tell you about Garak. It was the one ripple moment of the weekend. I said, "Garak's attitude is that if it moves, go for it!"
            
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_
        -   Q makes a play for Janeway. Keep in mind that while Q appears as a human when interacting with them, he is really an extradimensional being from a reality humans cannot comprehend in its natural state. His own explanation of the situation makes Jack Harkness sound positively Victorian in comparison when it comes to flexibility in the matter...
            
            **Q:** Now I see. You think I'm interested in some tawdry one night stand. That's because I haven't told you why I'm here yet. Out of all the females of all the species in all the galaxies, I have chosen you to be the mother of my child.  
            **Janeway:** Oh!  
            **Q:** I know that you're probably asking yourself, why would a brilliant, handsome, dashingly omnipotent being like Q want to mate with a scrawny little bipedal specimen like me?  
            **Janeway:** Let me guess. No one else in the universe will have you.  
            **Q:** Nonsense. I could have chosen a Klingon Targ, the Romulan empress, a Cyrillian microbe.  
            **Janeway:** Really? I beat out a single-celled organism? How flattering.
            
        -   When filming the finale of _Star Trek: Voyager_, when Alice Krige returned as the Borg Queen, she told the producer that in _Star Trek: First Contact_ all her scenes had been with Picard and Data and played as seductions (which would be enough to qualify her for this trope on its own; a semi-disembodied cyborg flirting with a human and an android), so she wasn't sure how to play scenes against Janeway and Seven. The producer told her, "She's omnisexual."
-   _The Witcher (2019)_: Downplayed Trope with Jaskier, who's somewhere between this and Really Gets Around. Their world is full of species like elves and dwarves, which are not _strictly human_ but are _people_ in any meaningful sense — they have human-like minds and humanoid bodies. The only thing that would deter a human from getting with them is Fantastic Racism. Jaskier doesn't mind, and clearly this is not _that_ unique since there are quite a few mixed-blood human-elves running around the Continent.
    
    **Vespula:** I've cursed you for chasing tail of every kind. Men, women, dwarves, elves, polymorphs...  
    **Jaskier:** That was one time and I... regret nothing. It was amazing.
    

    Music 

-   Every single member of GWAR is this, especially Oderus Urungus, Pustulus Maximus and (naturally) the Sexecutioner. In the song "Lust in Space", Oderus claims that the number of his sexploits is in the _billions_ and that, were it not for his overwhelming bloodlust, he would have gladly gone into porn.
-   Ninja Sex Party: Dan Avidan's stage persona, Danny Y. Sexbang, certainly counts. His middle initial stands for "you" as in "enveloping _you_ in a sensual manner."
-   "O Evangelho Segundo Serguei" by Brazilian comedy rock band U.D.R., has Serguei (a z-list music celebrity best known for claiming to have had an affair with Janis Joplin) wandering around the Garden of Eden and banging everything there: the lamb of God, the llama of God, the panda of God, the jacaranda tree of God, the _concrete mixer_ of God...

    Mythology & Religion 

-   Older Than Feudalism: Zeus in Greek Mythology. Due to his wife's constant jealousy and vindictive streak he often found it necessary to arrange unusual methods to carry out his liaisons. He once seduced a woman as an _ant_, so yeah, literally _anything_. Honourable mention to this list of the five things he _wouldn't_ do.
    
    05 CNN... they're always flashing sparkly lights all over the screen. Only one partner gets to explode in sparkly lights during sex, and that partner is the Z-man.
    
-   Loki in Norse Mythology—banged other giants, fathered many monsters, and once had sex with a _male_ horse in the form of a mare, and _gave birth to its foal_ (which became Sleipnir, the eight-legged horse of Odin). If Odin's claim in the _Lokasenna_ is true, Loki spent eight years on earth having sex with men as a woman. And yes, having their children too. Loki doesn't actually deny it, he just claims that Odin going around in the form of a female fortune teller is just as bad.

    Podcasts 

-   _Random Assault_: Matt will have sex with/ masturbate to pretty much anything.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Dragons are infamous for being able to breed with damn near anything, and the old Half-Dragon template could be applied to "any living, corporeal creature." Humanoids, animals, plants, _oozes?_ All rules-legal. Some dragons learn how to shapeshift in order to accomodate their partners, others, particularly evil ones, prefer to make an attempt in their natural forms.
    -   Outsiders are nearly as flexible, so there are several templates to represent celestial, fiendish, or other extraplanar ancestry. One Half-Human Hybrid, for example, is the Mechanatrix, an indication that at some point someone did the nasty with a clockwork embodiment of pure Law. Of the outsiders, fiends are most willing to have a go with anything they feel like, hence why Malcanthet, Queen of the Succubi, is this trope rather than a Depraved Bisexual - she doesn't restrict herself to male and female _humanoids_.
    -   Humans are jokingly referred to this, given the number of Half-Human Hybrids in the game, as well as all the races that are mostly human with a hint of the supernatural: Aasimars, Tieflings, Spellscales, Genasi, Mephlings, and so forth.
-   The _Exalted_ RPG plays with this trope a lot. The First Age Solars created new forms of life just to have sex with them, the Lunars routinely have sex with animals to breed new Beastmen, the Sidereals have relations with gods, the Dragonblooded are currently enjoying all the perks of being decadent imperial nobility, and the Abyssals have sex with the dead (Ick!). Fanon has further expanded on this concept.
    -   In canon, ordinary mortals can interbreed with gods, ghosts, demons, and The Fair Folk. Creation's a very flexible place like that.
    -   Also, Ma-Ha-Suchi in the First Age. His motivation is along the lines of having sex with every single Celestial Exalt in Creation...
-   In _RuneQuest_, the broo — goat-headed humanoid creations of the Chaotic goddess of perverted fertility — can and will mate with anything, and pregnancy will always result, and the offspring will always be a broo, and bad luck to you if you wouldn't normally have been anatomically capable of carrying and birthing a live broo.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Followers of Slaanesh in both 40K and _Warhammer_. Their whole Hat is that they are obsessed with the pursuit of sensations of any sort, to as extreme a measure as they can. When it comes to sex, there's no coupling that they will not try—not just because it's encouraged, but because it may be the only way to actually stimulate their burned-out senses and desires. Men, women, children, animals, corpses, daemons, aliens... if it's got a hole or a pole, they'll do it. Or they'll _make_ something they can screw, even if it kills their partner(s) to do so. Needless to say, the fluff avoids dwelling too deeply on their "habits".
    -   The practices of the Dark Eldar simply a continuation of the practices of their ancient forebears; whose excesses were so extreme that they gave birth to a new chaos god, Slaanesh. While their craftworld cousin eschew such extremes; those who leave as outcasts and corsairs often fall back into the ancient ways. Even the craftworld kin are not totally immune to this; after all, when your lifespan is measured in millennia, things like gender, age, familial ties, and even species tend to lose importance.

    Video Games 

-   From _Baldur's Gate_, we have Bhaal, Lord of Murder, who seems to have slept with anyone and anything that was capable of sexual reproduction to ensure that either he would be resurrected or replaced when he was finally felled. This is not an exaggeration. Some of the Bhaalspawn in the game include humans, half-orcs, elves, giants, dragons, and a chinchilla. Yes, that last one is something you find in the game.
-   The player character in pretty much any given BioWare game—increasingly so as time goes on and writers expand the variety of potential romantic interests.
-   _Chulip_: The protagonist kisses many people in order to win the heart of his love interest, whether they be his love interest's middle-aged father, an amnesiac zombie girl, an alien who looks like a macaque underneath his helmet or a Notzilla.
-   Dylan Fuentes from _Dead Rising 3_ will have sex with anyone and anything whether it be man, woman, dead or undead.
-   From the _Dragon Age_ series:
    -   Zevran, from _Origins_, claims that "my only rule about sex is that it be done well". He is an avid flirt with people of virtually every race and gender, and has some quite impressive tales of his promiscuity.
    -   Leliana has elements of this trope; though she is the most difficult party member to romance, she is very flirtatious with both men and women, of all ages, and in her Back Story, was much more sexually promiscuous.
    -   Isabela, both in her appearance in the first game (where she's an Optional Sexual Encounter for both a male and female Warden, and can be solicited for a threesome with Alistair, Zevran or Leliana, or a foursome with both Zevran and Leliana), and throughout the second.
        
        **Hawke:** How do you know Isabela?  
        **Zevran:** How does anyone _know_ Isabela?
        
    -   The Warden him/herself, much like Shepard, can express interest in a wide variety of individuals. The game gives him/her the opportunity to sleep with members of both genders, all four major humanoid races, a crossdressing dwarf, and even possibly a nug or two. You can even have the Warden flirt with a _golem_, although the golem is not particularly receptive.
    -   Hawke in _Dragon Age II_, can flirt with men, women, elves and dwarves, though the latter race is not a romance option, unfortunately.
    -   The Iron Bull from _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ is romanceable by players of any species or gender, and is willing to sleep with anyone interested who he's reasonably sure he won't break.
-   _Duke Nukem Forever_ depicts the famous Manly Man protagonist encountering an earth-invading alien queen monster, complete with explicitly detailed Multi Boobage, and Duke shamelessly has to note that he'd still hit that.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   Througout the series, Nymphs are said to be this in-universe. Nymphs are a type of nature spirit who take the form of beautiful, naked, long-haired women. The stereotype in-universe is that they are Brainless Beauties who run around having lots of indiscriminate sex. Ultimately Subverted, however, as most are rather shy and rarely approach mortals on their own.
    -   _Morrowind_:
        -   The Nerevarine can choose to "Admire" in the Persuasion Minigame. Though you don't get to see what your character actually says, the NPC responses are frequently responses to pick-up lines or come-ons. This happens regardless of their race or gender.
        -   Great House Hlaalu Councilor Crassus Curio has Camp Gay dialogue and shows obvious interest in the Player Character regardless of sex, wanting to see them naked before he'll help them advance in the House and wanting a kiss (or a sizable bribe) before supporting them as Hortator. He does this regardless of the player character's sex, be it human, elf, Khajiit, or even Argonian. In fact, he's famous as the author of the In-Game Novel "The Lusty Argonian Maid", in which a character named "Crantus Colto" gets his "spear" polished by the titular maid... Despite all of this, he's easily the most downright moral councilor in the House and quite the Guile Hero when it comes to fighting corruption within the House.
-   Reaver from the _Fable_ series always has several lovers of both genders, and in the third game, every "bedfellow" at a party of his is revealed to be a werewolf, which... you probably shouldn't think about too much.
    -   Not to mention in the third game, where you can enter his bedroom and find, sitting right next to each other, underwear, condoms... and Summon Creature potions. Again, don't think too hard about it. Please.
-   _Fallout 2_ allows the player to go this route (although it is generally easier with a female character, as Most Writers Are Male, and there is only handful of homosexual men in the game, but not vice versa) and awards the player a reputation based on it (regardless of sex): Gigolo. Oddly, you only have to sleep with one person to do it. However, if you sleep with 10 or more people, you get another one, Sexpert, which effectively gives you the benefit of a sex-related perk (Kama Sutra Master) for free.
    
    **Gigolo:** Let's be honest: You sleep with anything that walks on two legs. Sometimes, you're not even that discriminating.
    
    -   _Fallout 3_ gives a less-sexual version of the same with the "Lady Killer" and "Black Widow" perks, which give you a damage boost against and some unique interactions with members of the opposite sex - and then _New Vegas_ also adds "Confirmed Bachelor" and "Cherchez la Femme" to get the same boosts for members of the same sex, with nothing preventing you from taking both for your character's gender. They're not _completely_ ridiculous, though - they don't work against super mutants or feral ghouls, since neither really have genders, either in-story (for mutants) or in the programming (for the feral ghouls; sane ghouls are affected by them).
    -   Not only that, but there's one part in the game where you have the option to have sex with a robot. Named _Fisto._ And while you program it to be a Sexbot, it's physically a Tin-Can Robot. The guy who tasks you to find said robot is also _very_ excited that you've managed to acquire it, despite his insistence it's for someone else.
    -   _Old World Blues_ ups it by letting you hit on a _disembodied brain_. Specifically, _your own brain_. It's disturbed, to say the least.
    -   A Fiend leader known as Cook-Cook is considered one of the most vile and depraved characters in the game (being one of a handful of people with "Very Evil" karma), in no small part due to his napalm fetish, heavily implied cannibalism, and willingness to rape anyone or anything with an orifice. His track record includes men, women, children, and his favorite two-headed mutant cow. Based on his personality, the only reason he doesn't seem inclined add 'robot' to that list is that robots don't feel pain.
    -   Across _Fallout 4_ and its _Far Harbor_ and _Nuka-World_ add-ons, the player character is able to flirt and/or romance and mess around with: a reporter, a lounge singer, a paramilitary militia member, a drug-addled cage fighter, a hitman, a synth that previously existed as a robot, a soldier that as far as we know, _never takes off their suit of Power Armor_, a ghoul chem junkie, an ambitious raider, and a former actress-turned-_robobrain_ (as in a human brain put into a clunky robot body).
-   In _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, a few characters believe Sylvain to be this - Ingrid accuses him of hitting on her grandmother when he was eight and making eyes at a scarecrow one time (in the Japanese version, this was a cross-dressing man, likely changed due to Values Dissonance), and according to Flayn, Seteth told her that he's willing to go after men, women, and even chickens. Sylvain contradicts the chicken part, but all the rest seems to be accurate. But in practice, outside of his paired ending with Felix we really only see him hit on typically attractive looking women, and he explicitly doesn't flirt with Leonie because he mistakes her for a boy.
-   _Grand Theft Auto IV_: Eddie Low. Being assaulted by his father as a youth led to him developing a twisted personality that is bisexual and has almost every sexual fetish under the sun, including, but not limited to, torture and mutilation, sexual assault, necrophilia, incest (he has touched his grandfather inappropriately as well as being attracted to his mother), breast-feeding, cross-dressing, bestiality and public masturbation. He appears for a second time in a dark alleyway in western Berchem (at the same time again) and attempts to make small talk. Niko is taken aback by Low's strange and disturbing comments, including asking Niko if he enjoys being spanked. Niko sternly tells Eddie to "fuck off", and that his behavior is "not cool." An enraged Eddie launches into a tirade about how exactly he's tortured and killed children. For example, he says that he once kidnapped a quarterback, conducted anal rape, "strangled him into knots," and pulled out the intestines of another girl "just to see if he could feel anything. But he couldn't," Eddie states. This prompts Niko to respond with, "You should get laid or something." Eddie says that he already did; "a little jogger down by the water, but you know what, handsome, I got a hunger tonight that can't be sated, come here!" Low then takes out a knife and attacks Niko, who kills him in self-defense.
-   Howard "Buckshot" Holmes from _MadWorld_, who takes this trope into disturbing new extremes—sex _with plants_, for example:
    
    **Howard:** Jack just ate a happy ending!  
    **Kreese:** Don't you mean Happy Onion?  
    **Howard:** Clearly you've never had sex with an onion!
    
    -   Alternatively:
        
        **Howard:** I can't tell if that alien is a man or a woman, but Jack sure made it his _bitch!_  
        **Kreese:** How do you sex an alien, anyway?  
        **Howard:** As often as I can!
        
-   The asari from _Mass Effect_ are all female — that is, all potentially child-bearing — and can use the DNA from any other species to ensure genetic variance in their offspring. Only other asari are frowned upon as partners, such pairings having parallels with inbreeding in human culture. However, this is not reflective of individual asari, who have their own preferences and are no more or less promiscuous than anyone might be.
    -   More traditionally, the Ardat-Yakshi, which are asari born with a rare genetic condition that makes them akin to succubi or vampires, killing anyone with whom they have sexual intercourse and receiving a narcotic rush of pleasure and biotic power from the act. Most choose to live lives in solitude within special complexes with the option of supervised reintroduction into asari society if the demonstrate both the desire and the willpower to control themselves; the rest are considered psychopathic serial murderers who rack up horrifying bodycounts. Notably, the condition only appears in individuals with asari fathers, which is suggested to be the real reason that asari are discouraged from mating with each other.
    -   The second game also gives us Yeoman Kelly Chambers, who, in addition to being the only bisexual romance option in the second game, also cheerfully expresses an interest in _almost every known sentient species_. Any gender, and almost any alien, that's Kelly. Many speculate based on dialogue from Mordin that she doesn't necessarily stop with _sentient_ species.
        
        **Mordin:** Perhaps later. Trying to determine how scale-itch got onto Normandy. Sexually-transmitted disease. Only carried by varren. Implications unpleasant.
        
    -   Commander Shepard counts as well. S/he can sleep with men, women, and aliens. While the player may choose only one love interest or none, the fact that the options are there at all makes him/her fit the trope.
    -   Joker may fit as well. He watches alien porn and starts dating EDI, the _Normandy_'s AI, in ME3 after she gets a "hot robot body". Granted, he always had kind of a weird attachment to the Normandy; EDI just allowed it to be reciprocated. Credit for showing interest in a type of sentient being that Shepard doesn't.
-   _Monster Prom_: Normally, the player character is a Lovable Sex Maniac that can go for anyone as long as it's a monster, but accounting with the secret endings, they're also into computers, blobs, Eldritch Abomination and human-like characters.
-   The _Pokémon_ series has Ditto. It will do it with any other species in the game, aside from legendary and baby Pokémon, and oddly other Ditto (and of course humans, though no one really knows what would happen with that pairing). It will even do it with a few species like Rotom that won't breed with anything else. Of course, many Pokémon are a lot like this since they're able to breed with any other species in their Egg Group (well-known example: Skitty/Wailord).
    -   Justified in Ditto's case, since its gimmick is being able to transform into a copy of the Pokémon opposite it.
-   Not only has Tybir from _Torment: Tides of Numenera_ Seen It All, he also seems to have _slept with_ it all. Early on he just mentions that being a captain has a way of "lifting skirts and dropping trousers", but other tales clearly indicate participating in several multi-species orgies.
-   The protagonist of _Undertale_ can be an innocent Precocious Crush take on this trope: they can flirt with a female goat monster, a fish lady, a male skeleton, a genderless ghost, a plane, and a curvaceous slime mold, among others.

    Web Animation 

-   According to the Bard episode of JoCat's _A Crap Guide to D&D_, all Bards must be played as lust compelled sexual deviants who can and will attempt to seduce anything with a pulse, and any attempt to defy this stereotype will result in Matthew Mercer sneaking into your house to throw foam noodles at you from the corner of your living room.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Rather ironically, Felicia, the representative of the Bard class throughout the series, seems to only have eyes for Sasha (the Paladin).
-   Spike's description of Pinkie Pie in _PONY.MOV_.
    
    **Spike:** Oh, she'd fuck anything. Chicks, dudes, didn't matter. Fat guys, skinny guys, guys who climb on rocks, dogs, cats, squirrels... bugs... snails... She fucked a snail. I watched her fuck a snail once! That sounds weird, right, just hearing me say it? Imagine how weird it was to see it! She _FUCKED!_ A _SNAIL!_
    
-   _Sonic for Hire_:
    -   The eponymous Sonic has been shown to have limits, such as refusing sex from Tyris and Candy Kong, but Sonic still banged a wide variety of characters of different species in the series and overall is a highly perverted individual.
    -   Thunderhead is a straighter example; half of his screentime is devoted to his obsession with sex, including mentions of sex with animals and even zombies.
-   Tomelirolla from _Mundo Canibal_ is constantly horny and tries to hump anyone and anything that he sees in front of him, which often leads to a Running Gag of him humping a line of multiple people. His several victims include Santa Claus, Chuq Nóia (a Chuck Norris parody, although he gave his comeuppance), multiple kids at an orphanage, and _the Moon_.

    Webcomics 

-   Kate Beaton's _Hark! A Vagrant_ depicted Lord Byron like this. Remember, noun means "person, _place_, thing or idea". Once you're done with one, you can move on to the next.
-   Marena of _Keychain of Creation_—keep in mind, she's a Lunar Exalt (see Tabletop Games above). When asked how many people she has had sex with, Marena has to ask Secret to "Define 'people'." Her first answer was nine, because she was distracted and thought the question referred to 'at once'.
-   Both Eridan and his ancestor Cronus from _Homestuck_ count as examples of this. Eridan hits on everyone he sees, and his first conversation with a human ends with him trying to hit on her. His ancestor Cronus is even worse, trying to get people to pity him in increasingly desperate ways, to the extent that even Eridan thinks he's pathetic (that does not stop him, however, from going on a date with him). Justifiably, neither of them has gotten any.
-   _Oglaf_: Most of the cast operate on a sexual preference basis ranging from bisexuality to this trope. Special mention goes to Sandoval, the Ambassador of Xoan, if only because he did once, very explicitly, fuck a literal dessert.
    
    **Sandoval:** Ahh, croquembouche, my little gustatory coquette, are you trying to seduce me? Because, if so, mission accomplished.  
    **Servant:** Ah, excuse me, sir— are you fucking the dessert?  
    **Sandoval:** Oh, no no nooo. I really can't see anybody eating this now.
    
-   Denmark from _Scandinavia and the World_. Word of God says that he's an "everythingsexual", though he seems to lean more towards men.
-   _Sore Thumbs_: Rondel Mayflower IV is a self-described "multi-sexual", claiming bisexuality was "too limiting." He has been known to (spoilered for squick) eat buckets of horse semen.
-   Dmitri of _Spacetrawler_ will sleep with anything that has a sexual compatibility of over 50%, no matter how strange it may seem to everyone else. (Oddly, his conquests—so to speak—have been female so far, or close enough.)
-   Joel Calley from _Concession_ has tried to have sex, consensual or otherwise, with practically anything sexually mature. A couple times a Noodle Incident with a feral dog was brought up.
-   In _Skin Horse_, Tip Wilkin broadens his horizons considerably after hooking up with Artie, an attractive male shape-shifting rodent, and eventually falls into this trope. By this strip, he has reached the point where he sees nothing at all strange about propositioning a winged cyborg and her shapeless protoplasmic ur-entity husband for a threesome.
-   Bonabelle Fuzzmuffin III from _Corgi Quest_ is willing to flirt with anyone and anything, including a room.
-   _The Cummoner_: Vilga. To date, her lovers include various men, at least two women, a pair of satyrs and a demon plant. Also a group of shadow guardian hands, an eagle man (while escaping from a dragon!) and openly discusses the possibility of designing a trap that would keep her prisoner in constant orgasm until she dies. _She finds that last idea intriguing._
-   _Grrl Power_ has this exchange (in jest... probably).
    
    **Dabbler:** I find complex women arousing.  
    **Maxima:** _\[deadpan\]_ You find _stairs_ arousing.
    
-   _Mr. Boop_: Betty and Alec seem willing to have sex with anyone. Except for Betty's father:

_"This is one problem you can't threesome your way out of."_

-   Subverted in _Shadow Star_—when Norio finds out about Takero having seven kids from different relationships (he's no older than eighteen), he suspects him for being one of that kind of people, and even that he could take 'anything' literally and have sex with his Shadow Dragon. Takero Jossed it saying he's interested only in girls because only they can have children.

    Web Original 

-   In the BuzzFeed video "Questions Gay People Have for Bisexual People", one of the questions is "Do bisexual people have more three ways?", and in discussing stereotypes, a couple of the bi people mention "bi people are greedy".
-   _Dimension 20_'s _Fantasy High_ has Large Ham Pirate Bill Seacaster whom apparently slept with countless people no matter whether they were human, elf or orc. In his final moments with his son Fabian, Bill takes some pride in his tremendous sexuality noting “I had sex with a lot of people, it was always great, I was good at it, everybody came”.
-   _Dr. Havoc's Diary_: The Minions are always keen on fucking things. Even inanimate objects, and dead things. Even in the middle of a battle.
-   _The Most Popular Girls in School_: Episode 65 reveals that Mackenzie is willing to sleep with the main _Twilight_ boys. And not just that; with their faces on _balloons_. Guess how she pops one of the said balloons.
    
    **Mackenzie:** _\[in her video, to a balloon with Edward Cullen's face on it\]_ Oh I can't wait to be a vampire so we can finally make _loove_. Oh, can't we do it now, I can't wait! I want your glistening vampire penis inside of my human vagina! Edward, I'm not afraid.  
    **Shay:** _\[to Brittnay\]_ Oh God, she's gonna fuck those balloons.
    
-   Team Four Star's _Dragon Ball Xenoverse_ OC, Dumplin, is described as this although his method of having "sex" is likely far different from everyone else on this list's. Rather than the traditional, methods, Dumplin absorbs his partners and transports them to another plane of existence known as the Fuckbox.
    -   Coincidentally, the Fuckbox is also the name of Dumplin's nigh unbreakable combo, which increases the size of Dumplin's little black book exponentially. By the end of the series, he's "had sex" with every combatant in the DBZ universe (most of them multiple times, thanks to multiverse theory and diverging timelines), including a demon god, two Shadow Dragons and Omega Shenron, Kirran and Lani, "Fuckbox" Geoff, an obscene amount of alcohol and plastic cups, several video game systems, and if the guys' predictions are correct, _the entirety of the earth_ in at least one timeline. They also joked that he fertilized Tokitoki's egg in the sequel.
    -   Furthermore, because he can shapeshift, Dumplin's options are unlimited. He could turn into a key and fuck KaiserNeko's door.
        
        **Dumplin:** Open up, Kaiser. Let me in. _Knock. Knock._
        
    -   Puddin, Dumplin's daughter with Towa and the team's _Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2_ OC, was eventually confirmed to be omnisexual like her father... after a great deal of reluctance thanks to the guys playing overprotective dads.
-   _Tales of MU_:
    -   Mackenzie, as she's fallen in lust with women, men, and a Wholesome Crossdresser, and had sex with several more individuals that point. This includes a pair of mermaids trying to eat her, a devoutly religious woman who wants her dead, and a fox-girl that thinks she's in a magical girl anime. She does seem to prefer women, but that really does not stop her.
    -   Amaranth is a nymph who will have sex with any intelligent being whatsoever, so long as they consent. And she's trying to prove that animals are intelligent beings.
-   Agent Luxury from _Protectors of the Plot Continuum_. She's slept with men, women, possibly corpses and an anthropomorphic tiger-leopard, that last while in rabbit form.
-   Quoth _Uncyclopedia_:
    
    "Much has been made of Oscar's passion in 'putting it about,' whilst his sexual orientation has variously been classified as Bisexual, Homosexual, Metrosexual, Robofetishist and Cunning Linguist. Oscar himself described his sexuality as 'opportunistic'."
    
-   Duke Devlin from _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_, he's shown interest in robots, girls possessed by A.I's, guys, pretty much anything the characters come across while he's around. He answered "maybe" upon being asked if he wanted to be anal probed by aliens, groped Tristan's butt, flirts constantly with women, woke up in bed with Tristan and Joey, and when seeing Mai in a coma made the statement, "Wanna know the best thing about unconscious chicks? They can't say 'no'". He apparently classifies Piccolo from _Dragon Ball Z_ as a MILF.
-   Puppy in _Retarded Animal Babies._ In one episode, he claims his goal in life is to have sex with everything in existance, claiming that he's already had sex with 16% of everything in existance.
-   Ask That Guy apparently had sex with everything in his room, including the Christmas decorations and the books.
    -   Although Benzaie himself is usually more bisexual, his Bate persona shagged a coat because it was vaguely human shaped, which is apparently enough for him.
-   Lady Thae'lynn N'Quy, the Big Bad of _The Wulf Archives_. She's perhaps the most depraved character of the entire saga, even by Xeshite standards.
-   A common feature of Frederik K.T. Andersson's art gallery on Elfwood is a character known only as "The Bard," who has bedded (and had a kid with) pretty much every female fantasy creature in existence, to the point where it is a Running Gag. About the only female creature he _hasn't_ bedded is his elven traveling companion, who is quite annoyed at his antics.
    -   Including a rock. Including _having a kid with_ a rock.
    -   It turns out the main reason he hadn't gone for his travelling companion is because _he didn't realise she was a girl_, this is despite her clearly having breasts.
-   Princess Molestia has gone after other ponies, a gryphon, a minotaur, a tree, a fluffy pony (despite not finding holes on the thing), an in-setting fictional character, an unwilling tentacle monster, her own clones, and a loaf of bread. She's molested her own sister and tried to set up foursomes including her student, her student's brother, and his wife (who is also her niece). We've also seen her fantasize about the Changeling Queen and vegan mayonnaise, change ponies physical sexes against their will with a “Rule 63 ray gun” and do ''something'' with an alicorn-sized jar of jelly. There are things she won't do, but they're pretty far out there. The only no-no’s we know about are necrophilia and Pinkie-pie. Possibly because she’s _worse._
-   Elizas/Elisaz of _Einsteinian Roulette_ had sex with a tiger, tried to fondle a cyborg while wrestling it and was considered guilty of being an all-around pervert.
-   Ken Shardik has been accused of genegeneering new species just so he could have sex with them. It isn't really the case, as he has sex with a lot of beings he didn't genegeneer as well and he's actually fairly selective (he meets a LOT of people over the first 35000 years of his life).
-   Ryuk in _Death Note: The Abridged Series (kpts4tv)_. He'll hit that be it Light, Misa, Matsuda, or a dirty apple. There's also an awkward moment between Ryuk and Light's dad.
-   Sonic from _Sonic for Hire_, who has had sex with practically female he's seen... including a Birdo, a giant brain monster (drunk though), a bunch of humans, and even Wreck-it Ralph's sister! The only thing Sonic refuses to fuck is Candy Kong...
-   Sam Bradford in NFL Quarterbacks On Facebook is one as well. In addition to women, men, and his sister, Bradford has also supposedly fucked a horse, a calf, a baby rhino, and wrote a guide to his sexual exploits in the future, known as the Kama Samtra.
-   Micheal Swaim from _Agents of Cracked_ is a Depraved Bisexual who called a barstool "hot" and asked people to bring it back to his place for an orgy. He also got kicked off a horse-enthusiast blog for trying to debate which one had the biggest slong.
-   Spark from _Floating Point_ is a living A.I. inside an entirely digital world. As a result, she could care less what shape another Program's avatar takes... male, female, furry, robot, tentacle monster, superintelligent shade of the color blue, doesn't matter for her Lovable Sex Maniac lifestyle. Others in her world don't quite feel the same way, preferring specifically gendered humanoid shapes.
-   _The Jenkinsverse_ 's Rylee Jackson would happily experiment in interspecies sex if A) any of the aliens were up for it and B) if it wouldn't inevitably result in massive internal injuries for her partner.
-   Jay in _Deep Space 69_. He has had sex with burritos, a dragon, and attempted to have sex with a _female-shaped planet_. Yes, a planet.
-   _Tails From The Federation_:
    -   Darkblade, full-stop. Even from his introduction, his one-track mind is pretty clear: flirt (and _sleep_) with anyone he finds attractive (regardless of gender or species). He does have a long list, and a certain raccoon lady is on that list.
    -   _Bloody Cutlass_, the Hotter and Sexier story of the collection, has a lot more "sexcapades" (naturally, since Darkblade is the protagonist here).
-   Slenderman's brother, Sexual Offenderman will have sex with men, women, animals, corpses, children, inanimate objects, and the undead.
-   _Caillou_ is often portrayed this way in Youtube Poops, as he has had (often non-consensual) sex with his parents, his younger sister, his grandfather, his classmates, his cat, his teddy bear, his rubber ducky, his fireman's hat, his father's car, and that's just for starters.
-   _Inglip_: The Dark Lord Inglip has expressed interest in feminine lesbians, a "man-knot", and stocking his harem with "the nonalive."

    Western Animation 

-   _All Hail King Julien_: Julien definitely isn't picky. In one of the first episodes he's willing to marry and mate with a fossa, not caring about the fact that he doesn't know the fossa's gender. And also ignoring the fact that fossas repeatedly attack his kingdom and kill countless lemurs.
-   _American Dad!_:
    -   Roger the alien. In one episode, he actually referred to himself as a pansexual. "The Great Space Roaster" features a running gag of Roger having sex with books. The family even jokes about it towards the end of the episode.
        
        **Steve:** Hey, Roger, go take some euphoria and rape the data journal!  
        **Roger:** I've been eyeing it, I'm not gonna lie.
        
    -   Andy Dick, who acts like the human version of Roger, is said to have sex with groceries.
-   _Big Mouth_:
    -   Jay is only thirteen, but is incredibly horny and willing to have sex with anything. He regularly fucks inanimate objects, though some turn out to be anthropomorphic, such as his pillow, which he somehow _knocks up_. He also eventually comes out as bisexual and embraces his sexual (and romantic) attraction to boys _and_ girls.'' His eagerness is justified in part by his troubling Parental Neglect, as he's left to his own devices a lot and has to learn sexual boundaries on his own.
    -   Hormone Monsters by their very nature are willing to have sex with absolutely anything, especially Maury. Maury has even fucked a decapitated head and a hole he punched in Andrew's wall (which he drew around to resemble a lady).
-   Although she's too young to actually _do_ anything beyond kissing, Tina Belcher of _Bob's Burgers_ is attracted to anything and anyone that moves, whether they're boys, zombies, geese or the words "bumper-to-bumper", and has written sexually-explicit fanfiction on everything from _The Twilight Saga_ to _The Simpsons_ to _Sesame Street_ of all things.
-   _Drawn Together_: Most of the characters to some degree, but especially Captain Hero, who is the absolute incarnation of this trope, having had sex with/raped (by) everything from women, men, robots, dead bodies, children, animals, family members, his own Bizarro twin etc. (he is a very twisted individual). Honestly, he goes _beyond_ this trope, since "moves" isn't one of his requirements, and the inability to is in fact one of his preferences. According to Word of God, his preference is "Anything, especially if it's helpless."
-   _Ducktales 2017_: Aside from girlfriends of various different species, Launchpad McQuack's past paramours also include a clone of himself, a sapient cloud, and a were-duck whose concept artist described as being non-binary.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Stewie's sexual advances on Brian the family male dog, attraction to women (older and his age as well as a brief attraction to his own mother) daydreaming of a buffed up Rupert (his teddy bear) and acting pissed off when a replacement dog humps Rupert acting much like his love of his life was assaulted and killing the one responsible; and a scene where he was hinted to have slept with a doll.
    -   Peter is attracted to women, has had sexual relationships with men (Bill Clinton for example), is Ambiguously Bi and in one instance was shown to have intentions of wanting to have sex with a tiny female rat and also was in an abusive sexual relationship with a male bull who had raped him. There are even unfortunate implications that he's sexually attracted to minors (has a crush on Connie D'Amico, once told Lois that he shouldn't nag him about being a kids' show host as he "...can have any 3-year-old \[he\] wants", told a kid on a little leagues team that he had "the best ass on the field" and the reveal that he collects pictures of baby genitalia) "Fresh Heir" also implies he'll go as far as incest and ephebophillia, as it's heavily implied he wanted to do more than just marry Chris for his father-in-laws inheritance and checked out another kid which made Chris jealous, and was willing to promise an obscene sex with Chris when he was taking Lois's place while she was away. He also once requested that his daughter Meg kiss him on the lips after he found out she was dating a perfect guy and one gag showed them in bed together. He also had sex with the Surfing Bird record. He's also implied to have put his penis in a whale/dolphin's blowhole, saying that it's the reason he can never go back to Sea World. Also, when he thought Lois was hotter fat and enjoyed sex with her more. However, she had a heart attack and had the fat removed. Cue a store closet opening to reveal Peter _trying to have sex with Lois's removed fat_. There was also a cutaway gag where he had sex with a lamb and requested they move in together.
    -   Meg is implied to be this. She's primarily attracted to men but has also shown interest in woman, particularly Connie (stubbornly stating she was going to masturbate to Connie while in the bath and once kissed her after knocking her unconscious), was hinted to be interested in going all the way with her brother Chris even after he took off his halloween costume and made his identity known to her, implied she's be willing to pleasure herself to her mother Lois's modelling photos as she wanted to "fit in" with the rest of the family, and once developed a Yandere crush on the family dog Brian. She also masturbated using hot dogs once saying she was going to pretend they were the New York Knicks.
    -   Quagmire is said to "bang anything" and is once seeing doing exactly that to meatloaf. While he's also primarily into women, he also has Ambiguously Bi tendencies towards men, particularly Peter. One episode revolved around his 1000th sexual encounter being a cooked large mouth sea bass. A couple scenes implies he’s into incest with his family, he’s into necrophilia, and he engages in sexual activities with animals even.
        
        **Quagmire:** Hello 911? It's Quagmire. _\[beat\]_ No, it's stuck in a _window_ this time...
        
-   Yivo from _Futurama_: The Beast With A Billion Backs. Shkle (Yivo's pronoun of choice) is an oddly powerful being who "merges" with trillions of life forms across the universe. What planet they are from does not matter—as long as they are organic, and have a person-level mind to "connect" with.
    -   Types of things Bender has slept with or otherwise shown attraction to: fembots, human women, heads in jars, spaceships, and non-sentient appliances.
    -   Though there's occasionally taboos against robots and humans having intercourse, this is generally crossed. Then there's the many ...close encounters... between species and planets, especially the species Zapp has bedded (or claimed to). Finally, that time Fry made out with the radiator woman from the Radiator Planet. It was normal radiator.
-   Scanlan of _The Legend of Vox Machina_ notes when asked that his life goal is "to bed every being in the realm"...in a fantasy land based heavily on Dungeons & Dragons. The mind boggles. Most of his conquests aren't shown on-screen, though he's shown flirting or going further with several women, men, and a grotesque two-headed Humanoid Abomination.
-   _American Dragon: Jake Long_: Fu Dog could be the poster child for this trope, he has flirted with and dated numerous women from different races, ages, and looks (beauty isn’t the most important thing for him it seems). These women include a hunchback, elves, cyclopses, a pixie, arachnid-human (Veronica), a female Cerberus, other magical dogs, humans, a centaur, Ms. Hades (yes it is indeed a female version of Disney Hades), a gargoyle, normal dogs, and an individual with two humanoid upper bodies sharing a lizard’s lower body, just to name a few.
-   _The Ren & Stimpy Show_: Stimpy. In the original series (unlike Ren, he was never portrayed as attracted to any female character, though the very first episode showed Stimpy as a chick magnet when he became famous). In 'The House of Next Tuesday' he uses a gadget to envision himself surrounded by sexy women. And in 'A Visit To Anthony' both characters are seen to have wives. Also both have a heavy Ho Yay filled relationship of sorts with each other complete with an almost sex scene. Both have openly declared love for each other and Stimpy is a humanoid cat and Ren a humanoid chihuahua. Also, Stimpy once fell for and married an actual raw chicken, and later a chuck roast of sorts, after Ren got jealous (and hungry) and ate the chicken.
-   Rick Sanchez from _Rick and Morty_ is shown to be pansexual in the episode, "Auto Erotic Assimilation," where he rekindles a past relationship with his genderless hivemind lover, Unity, who has assimilated an entire alien planet of which Rick then proceeds to have sex with regardless of gender or species, which includes coalminers who may have sexually transmitted infections and the alien equivalent of a giraffe. He is also shown in past episodes to flirt with aliens and to have memories of having sex with a grotesque monster-woman hybrid with an inhuman appearance, not to mention the time he thought he impregnated a planet.
-   Princess Entrapta from _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_. Her "diet" includes aliens, robots and, on one memorable occassion, a spaceship.
-   Helen Klench from _Sit Down, Shut Up_ is occasionally attracted to humans, but usually only when they are dressed up to resemble inanimate objects. More often, she's depicted as having romances with things like a coat rack, a toilet brush, a moose, or one of those arm-flailing tube men set up in front of a store for advertising. This is implied to be related to her Ambiguous Gender.
-   _Total Drama_: Rodney admits in his audition tape for Pahkitew Island that one of the girls that he had a crush on might not have have actually been a girl but may have been a mannequin and despite this fact still says it is true love.
-   _Ugly Americans_: Randall, Mark's zombie roommate, shows a disturbing willingness to sleep with pretty much anyone, and _anything_. Some of his conquests include three pig women, a walking talking brain creature, a big fat blob thing, a robot (Which turned out to just be the toaster) and so on. His dick actually _quit_ because of this.
-   Emperor Awesome (a shark man) from _Wander over Yonder_ has hit on Sylvia, a sandwich (who was possessed by a body-snatching parasite, It Makes Sense in Context) and a boa constrictor. Word of God states he is pansexual.
