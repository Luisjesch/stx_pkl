Even if they get away with it, they'll rob a bank too.

**Doc Brown:** Freeze!  
**Engineer:** Is this a hold-up?  
**Doc Brown:** _\[Beat\]_... It's a science experiment!

A staple of The Western, an outlaw gang with bandanas over their faces boards a train to rob it. This was especially common during the period that payroll shipments were sent by train. If the railroad itself or the railroad industry in general is an antagonist in the movie, expect to see at least one of these. In addition to stealing high-value cargo, they demand that passengers surrender their jewelry and money.

A common Caper for films set in the right period. The earliest train robbery was probably the Great Gold Robbery of 1855 - the earliest one in the USA (outside the Civil War) occurred in 1866. So it's basically as old as railways themselves. May eventually lead to a Traintop Battle or to a posse chasing the robbers.

While mainly associated with westerns, train robberies can be set in the modern day with diesel locomotives or subways, or in science fiction settings with futuristic mag-lev trains.

The video game equivalent is the Locomotive Level.

See also Armed Blag, which is a robbery of an armored car.

-   In _Back to the Future Part III_, Doc hijacks a local train. When asked if this was a train robbery, he responds that it's a "science experiment." In some ways, this is an inversion of the trope. Other robbers would take valuables from the train and leave the train itself undamaged. Doc and Marty took the engine (and destroyed it); the valuables on the train weren't even discussed, much less taken. Although considering the comparative value of gold to that of a locomotive at the time, they actually destroyed something worth a lot more than regular robbers would have taken from anything short of a bank transport train.

Then they grease the tracks to stop the engine. Knock out th engineer and brakeman, and shoot any of the Union soldiers in the baggage car (with the gold) who try to come out and fight. Then they detach the rest of the train from the engine, to go rolling down the tracks, while tossing a hornets nest into the car to force all of the Union guards to jump out (tossing in a torch to smoke out the hornets once all of them are gone). Several miles down the track, more of the Confederates have tied lots of ropes across the track, to trees, which are pulled out of their roots when the train hits home, serving as an anchor which stops the train.
