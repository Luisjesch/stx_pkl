_"The sun's fire makes a garden grow,  
A forge fire tempers steel.  
Why then are you surprised to find  
A fire that can heal?"_

Fire burns, and has been used as a weapon since before recorded history, but sometimes that gets turned around and fire is instead used to heal or treat wounds.

In works that tend towards realism, this most often takes the form of cauterization: the medical practice of searing a wound to prevent blood loss and reduce the likelihood of infection.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In more fantastical works, fire may heal by means of the concept of "purity", burning away contamination and leaving the essence of a thing behind.

A common element with both mundane and fantastic uses of fire to heal is that it causes a great deal of pain in the process, thus lending itself to metaphors about enduring temporary hardship for long-term gain. For similar reasons, it can be an expression of Bad Powers, Good People, with a power that's typically used for harm turned around to heal instead. In other cases, a being who is cursed to be unable to use their power for good may use this form of healing as a kind of Loophole Abuse.

Some attacks, like a Laser Blade or Frickin' Laser Beams, may cauterize wounds in the process of being employed, but that's not typically a case of this trope so much as it is a justification for Bloodless Carnage. Real life laser wounds would actually be a lot nastier than fiction anyway, since they would not cauterize in any helpful way, and there would be gruesome damage from water inside the flesh explosively vaporizing.

Compare Feed It with Fire, where fire or lightning _in and of itself_ has a curative effect.

Related to The Flame of Life, where fire symbolizes life.

Contrast Kill It with Fire. See also Fire Purifies and Worst Aid. See also Heal It with Water and Healing Winds.

Can be an ability of Sacred Flames.

As noted above, the practice of cauterization to close wounds has been largely discredited in modern medicine, so **Don't Try This at Home**.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Alice in Borderland_, Akane gets impaled through the abdomen and, lacking any other means of first aid, has to cauterise the wound using a hot pipe.
-   _Baki the Grappler_ has Baki sterilizing the bite Ando got from the Yasha Ape by spreading gunpowder on it and setting it off.
-   Fana from _Black Clover_ has the Flame Magic recovery spell Phoenix Robe (that she got from the body of the human Fana), that produces flames able to heal herself and others.
-   _Blue Exorcist_ the Impure King arc shows Rin using his blue flames in this way. His way is more interesting and most likely valid; he _burns_ away the disease and every piece of the Impure King specifically targeting it while leaving all the exorcists, plants and whatnot unharmed. He had to use a purification mantra and needed help from a high ranked demon as well, but the targeting was all him.
-   Natsu of _Fairy Tail_ does this to one of his guildmates (only in the manga).
-   At the climax of the final arc in _Flame of Recca_, Recca uses the ability of the final flame dragon, Resshin, whose power is to turn the soul of any human he chooses into his own flames, reviving Yanagi, whose soul was about to be devoured by the Tendou Jigoku, as part of his flame. As Yanagi’s ability in life was that of healing, Recca’s flame gains the power to heal, which he uses not only to cure the injuries of all his friends, but also cures the tortured souls of the people used to create the Tendou Jigoku, effectively destroying its source of regeneration and making it vulnerable enough to be destroyed.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, Roy Mustang sears his own wound closed after getting stabbed by Lust. It's only a temporary measure, though, and he winds up collapsing shortly afterwards and has to go to the hospital, and he even admits that in doing so, he almost passed out from the pain.
-   In the fifth _The Garden of Sinners_ movie Paradox Spiral, Enjou Tomoe presses the stub left over after his arm fell off against a very hot slab of metal to seal it up. Even if the act itself is somewhat worthless since he's a fake human, and the stub wasn't even bleeding... it's the thought that counts.
    -   Possibly trying to burn shut his shoulder to stop the gears inside falling out.
-   "Flame Hero", Endeavor from _My Hero Academia_ has used his powers to cauterize life threatening injuries occasionally to keep people alive long enough for proper medical personell to arrive.
-   _One Piece_, Marco the phoenix has a devil fruit that lets him transform into a phoenix made out of blue fire that heals injuries.
    -   "Foxfire" Kin'emon uses his flaming sword technique to cauterize a severed arm at one point.
-   In _Pokémon Adventures_, Entei's flames apparently have some kind of healing power as it cured Blaine of his Mewtwo cancer.
-   _Promare_: The Burnish can regenerate which protects them from dangers such as being encased ice, burned or shot, but they will die and turn to ash if their flames go out. To prevent this, Burnish can perform a sort of CPR by blowing their flames into a dying person, akin to mouth-to-mouth. A successful attempt can allow a Burnish to regenerate their entire body even if they are already turning to ash, though the procedure is not guaranteed to work, as seen when Lio fails to save Thyma.

    Comic Books

-   In the third volume of _New Mutants_, Doctor Nemesis triggers Magma's molten form in order to cauterize some wounds she'd suffered earlier.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In one _Superman/Batman_ issue, a Serial Killer cuts off a thief's hand and Superman uses his heat vision to cauterize the wound.
    -   In _Supergirl (2005)_ story arc _Girl Power_, Supergirl uses her heat vision to cauterize a gunshot wound on Starfire's right shoulder.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: In this _Godzilla_ MonsterVerse fanfiction, during the battle on Yonaguni, Rodan's bio-volcanic heat cauterizes Monster X's fresh injuries.
-   The fanfic _Book 5: Legends_ we're introduced to a firebender healer by the name of Temuji.
-   In the _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ fanfic _Embers (Vathara)_, Zuko rediscovers techniques where fire bending can be used to heal. When he uses it during his travels through the Earth Kingdom, he has to disguise it as massages with hot stones or steaming water treatments.
-   In _Fates Collide_, Mordred impales Edmond Dantes and warns him not to pull the sword out or else he will bleed to death. He gets so angry that he pulls it out anyway and seals the wound shut with a blast of fire. Martha calls him a moron and says he's lucky he didn't die.
-   Used in an emergency to stem Tercio's bleeding in _Just Before the Dawn_, until he's able to receive proper medical care for his wounds.
-   _Phoenix's Tear: Reignition_: The Tear gives Hare healing abilities that take the form of magical flames. While this isn't generally presented as painful, described as a soothing heat, _Eigengrau_ has him explicitly sealing Gray Wolf's wounds through cauterization.
-   _Triptych Continuum_:
    -   Celestia's connection to SUN allows her to channel heat to burn out infection or sickness. It's noted that the only reason this doesn't do more harm than good is that Celestia's control of the channeled heat is precise enough to only burn the infection, while leaving the healthy tissue surrounding it untouched.
    -   In _Glimmer_, Spike is suffering from a buildup of fluid in his lungs (dragons are built for hot, _dry_ climates, and they're in the middle of a rainforest). To help treat this, Twilight starts a fire and has Spike sit in it. Superheating his body in this way doesn't hurt him, but it does literally boil the excess fluid out of his lungs.
-   In _War and Peace in Mind_, this becomes a new aspect of Warren's power. However, overusage of it can possibly put him out or worse.

    Film — Animation 

-   _Batman: Gotham Knight_. In "Working Through Pain", Batman uses some kind of glowing disc from his utility belt to seal a gunshot wound.

-   In _Braveheart_, Hamish's father needs to have a wound cauterized with a red hot iron after receiving an arrow to the shoulder. In a nice nod to how such a thing might have played out in those days, alcohol gets a lot of use both as an anesthetic and disinfectant. Unusually for this sort of scene, it's played more for laughs than drama, as a whole line of brave Scottish warriors get handed the iron and told that they're going to be the one to use it, only to immediately pass it on to the next guy, saying "You do it... I'll hold him down". When they finally get some poor sap to actually do it, there are at least half a dozen men holding the patient down. Sure enough, the first thing dad does when he gets up after the treatment is to punch the guy who applied the iron, even though the guy is in the middle of frantically apologizing.
-   _Clash of the Titans (2010)_: The Djinni summons up an eerie blue flame to purify Perseus' poisoned wound. It's extremely painful and he doesn't bother to _warn_ Perseus in advance, so he has to fight off several of Perseus' companions before they realize he's actually healed him.
-   In _Day of the Dead (1985)_, one of the protagonist's arms is cut off after he is bitten by a zombie. His friends then cauterize the stump with a makeshift torch. Whether or not this saved him from infection is unknown, as he was devoured by zombies soon after.

-   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_: Godzilla's retreat where he recharges his energy is revealed to be a highly-radioactive subterranean cave with geothermal activity, hot enough to potentially kill any human who steps foot inside. What's more, after Godzilla is severely crippled due to the Oxygen Destroyer's effects, the heroes massiely speed up his regeneration from years to a few seconds by detonating a nuclear warhead right in front of him.
-   In _Hidalgo_, after falling into a concealed trap in the sand filled with wooden stakes, the titular character seals the stab wound his horse suffers using his heated knife.

-   In _John Carpenter's Vampires_, Montoya does this pretty much every time he's wounded, once with a lighter, and once by firing his sub-machine gun into the air then holding the hot barrel to the wound. It is unclear whether this is to prevent vampirism from being transmitted or to attempt to heal the wound itself.

-   _The Killer (1989)_ does this with gunpowder from a shotgun shell. Being as neither of the heroes has anesthesia, the cop gives the title character a big stick to bite down on before igniting the powder.
-   B-Western _The Last Outlaw_ features the leader of an outlaw group who pours gunpowder into a shoulder wound and lights it on fire to cauterize it. Quite squicky and cringe inducing because we see the flames spouting out of both sides of his shoulder since the bullet went straight through.
-   In _Man of Steel_, Lois is injured by a Kryptonian security robot when she discovers the ship. Clark notes that she's hemorrhaging internally and proceeds to cauterize the injury with his heat vision.
-   Whatever the hell that blue stuff is that the Predator puts in his wounds to stop the bleeding. In the second movie, it appears to seal off the stump of his severed hand quite efficiently, and it clearly hurts like hell.
-   In _Out of Reach_ William Lansing heals Irena's gunshot wound with a knife heated over a burning stove. After digging the bullet out, of course.
-   In _Rambo III_, Rambo gets impaled through the stomach with a bit of wooden shrapnel; leaving both an entry and exit wound. After pulling the remaining shrapnel out he cuts off a tip of a bullet, pours the gunpowder into the wound and then sets it alight; with flames coming out of both sides. With this being Rambo, the wound barely slows him down, and fortunately for Rambo, setting off a gunpowder explosion inside of an open wound going deep through his body did not cause him to die of gangrene and sepsis less than a week later.
-   In _The Revenant_, Glass seals his throat wound by covering it with gun powder and then igniting it.
-   In _Revenge (2017)_, Jen heals her injuries by cutting open and flattening an aluminum beer can, holding it over the fire and then pressing it against her wound. In doing so she inadvertently brands the beer can's logo on her flesh, which happens to be The Phoenix. (The film has a lot of phoenix symbolism in it.)

-   Doctor Gordon is shown to have survived his wounds thanks to this technique in _Saw 3D_.
-   The Headless Horseman from _Sleepy Hollow (1999)_ decapitated his victims, and it was noted that the head wounds were cauterized instantly, as though the blade used was red hot. Constable Crane wondered how this could be possible, due to the absence of blistering of the skin or scorch marks on the clothing. The superstitious believed it to have been caused by "the Devil's fire."
    -   Constable Crane himself survives and recovers from a stab wound much more quickly than he should have due to this effect.
-   _Star Trek Beyond_. Bones uses a captured energy weapon to heat up a shard of metal, using it to cauterize Spock's wound. This is only a holding action, as they have to walk to a place that fortunately has more advanced medical equipment.
-   Lightsabers in the _Star Wars_ franchise appear to automatically cauterize flesh as they cut, with one exception: In _A New Hope_, there's a bit of blood when Obi-wan cuts off Ponda Baba's arm in the cantina (may have been a very, very minor example of Early-Installment Weirdness).
    -   The Expanded Universe attempts to justify it by saying his species' biology is just weird like that.
-   The main character of _Ultraviolet (2006)_ cauterizes one of her wounds with the heat generated by firing her gun.

    Literature 

-   Ciaphas Cain, **HERO OF THE IMPERIUM**, has mentioned several times that since lasgun shots cauterize the wound, it's better to be hit with a lasgun than a solid-slug weapon.
-   Inverted in _Codex Alera_: in this setting, Elemental Powers are capable of many things that they aren't capable of in some magic systems. Control over water includes the ability to heal people, possibly because most of the human body is water. However, Elemental Rock-Paper-Scissors is also in effect, and touching or being near one element prevents the other from being used. Therefore, cauterization makes it nigh impossible for a watercrafter to heal the wound.
-   In the first book of the _Coldfire Trilogy_, the Hunter uses coldfire (fae generated blue flames that are as cold as real fire is hot) to cleanse Senzei's gangrenous wound.
-   Similarly to the above, the dragon Firedrake demonstrates that his firebreath, which is also blue, actually heals people instead of burning them in the book _Dragon Rider_ by Cornelia Funke.
-   In Ed Greenwood's _Forgotten Realms_ novel _Spellfire_, it's eventually discovered that the eponymous fire can in fact be used to heal, not just to burn. Justified here in that what it really is is the barely controlled raw essence of magic itself, not just any old fire spell or mundane form of combustion.
-   In _Green Hills and Dragon Tales_, John amputates Ellis' rotting leg by burning it off with dragonfire.
-   In _The House of Hades_, Percy and Annabeth drink from the River Phlegethon, a river of literal fire, to heal themselves from the poison of Tartarus. It works.
-   The dragons and Dragonlords in Joanne Bertin's _The Last Dragonlord_ and _Dragon and Phoenix_ can channel their fire breath into a healing ability. It Makes Sense in Context.
-   In _Misery_ by Stephen King, Anne Wilkes uses a blow torch to prevent blood loss when she amputates the protagonist's foot.
-   The ending of _Making Money_ had Moist cauterizing the gangrenous finger of Cosmo by bringing his imitation Vetinari ring under the sun, making its stygium components white-hot.

-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, Victorion Greyjoy has to have his hand cauterized by a red priest to save him from blood poisoning. However, this priest worships a god of fire and has received a power boost due to dragons reemerging from extinction, and as a result, Victorion's arm becomes superhumanly strong.
    -   Boiling wine is a standard treatment to simultaneously cauterize and sterilize wounds.
-   How Mackenzie Calhoun of the _Star Trek: New Frontier_ series by Peter David got his facial scar: self-cauterization while seriously injured and lying alone in the desert with a laser welder.
-   Happens a few times in Barbara Hambly's _Sun Wolf and Starhawk_ books, usually after nuuwa attacks. And then, there's Sun Wolf gouging out his own eye and cauterizing the socket in _The Ladies of Mandrigyn_.
-   Kantri of _Tales of Kolmar_ flame their own wounds clean, especially when they've been fighting demons, which leave a kind of taint otherwise.
-   In _The Tenets of Futilism,_ Joe cauterizes the enormous wounds cut into Sasha's arms and stomach with a lighter, saving her from bleeding out.
-   Joelle Charbonneau's _The Testing_ has Cia cauterizing Tomas's wound with a hot piece of metal.
-   Kaladin from _The Way Of Kings_ by Brandon Sanderson uses such techniques several times, generally when working in sub-par conditions or with suboptimal equipment - which is standard in the bridge crew.
-   In _The Wheel of Time_, the Weaves for Healing traditionally only use Air, Water, and Spirit. Until Nynaeve discovers that the most powerful form of Healing includes the two other elements, Fire and Earth, which can accomplish many more powerful feats of Healing, such as reversing the effects of those who have been severed of the One Power.
-   In _Wings of Fire_, Peril uses her burning scales to heal Clay when he is bitten by a venomous dragon bite viper. It _is_ noted that he would have died from his burns if he wasn't virtually immune to fire and heat, and he still was permanently crippled by the injury.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The 100_ makes frequent use of this since the characters are living in the wild on earth with no real medical supplies. On one instance after the character applying the red hot iron has just acknowledged that the wound has _already_ been cauterized and is likewise already infected. The only reason none of the patients die from infection is because there is a local species of seaweed that has powerful antibiotic properties, and it is readily available.
-   In the pilot of _Animal Kingdom_ Craig cauterizes his gunshot wound. He still almost dies of infection before a doctor in Mexico cures him.
-   _The Boys (2019)_. In "The Bloody Doors Off", Starlight uses her energy superpowers to cauterize Hughie's wound so he won't bleed out before they can get him to a hospital. Though she's delayed in doing so because she needs a working power source to draw energy from.
-   _Burn Notice_ inverted this by having Michael use a liquid nitrogen gun to both cauterize a wound (which he secretly had planned) and to sabotage the bad guys pistol.
-   Subverted in _Charmed (1998)_. Colonial era witches were about to cauterize someone's wound, but Piper instructs them to just use hot water and soap.
-   _Chris Ryan's Strike Back_. The protagonist does this in Zimbabwe, also using the powder from a cartridge.
-   _Cowboy Bebop (2021)_. A medical device emitting a laser beam is shown being used to treat bullet wounds, such as when Jet Black patches up Faye Valentine in "Callisto Soul". Presumably however it's backed up by other treatments like antibiotics.
-   Spoofed in _Danger 5_. Jackson gets impaled by a splinter, so he fires his Luger into the wound to sterilize it.
-   In season one of _Daredevil (2015)_ Matt Murdock uses a road flare to cauterize a Russian mob leader's bullet wound as per the advice of Claire Temple, a nurse with a talent for on-the-fly medical assistance. He's in an Abandoned Warehouse with no first aid kit, and has to keep the mobster from bleeding out long enough to spill the goods on the mysterious man he's been working with. The mobster had earlier had Claire tortured in an effort to find out Matt's Secret Identity, so she's not particularly bothered how much it hurts the man.
-   _Forever_: In the first episode, a suspect throws poison on Jo's hand. It's already started to penetrate Jo's skin, so Henry neutralizes it by squirting ethanol over the area, then _setting it on fire_ and not letting her put it out for several seconds.
-   In _Frontier (2016)_ Declan Harp has been tortured (but don't worry, "Torture Is Ineffective") and is examining his wounds. It doesn't look all that bad and in fact seems to be healing nicely, but a hot blade is still called for.
-   _Game of Thrones_.
    -   Averted in "Mockingbird" when Sandor Clegane is bitten on the neck, yet refuses to allow Arya Stark to cauterize the wound due to his fear of fire. Arya cleans it with water, but it still gets infected, hampering Sandor's fighting skill later on.

-   _Halo (2022)_. In the Season One finale, Riz gets half her chest blown away by a plasma grenade. Master Chief disconnects a fuel line, ignites it with a spark and turns it directly on the wound. Anyone but a SPARTAN Super-Soldier would likely have died of shock.
-   In the 2020 miniseries _The Head_, the doctor on an isolated Antarctic research station gets shot accidentally and has to advise her boyfriend on how to treat her injuries, including cauterizing a vein. In this case he uses the proper surgical tool for this trope—the problem however being that the doctor can't take anything except a local anaesthetic as she has to be fully conscious.
-   In the _Lost_ season 1 finale, Sayid cauterizes Charlie's wound by opening a bullet and igniting the gunpowder. This wound is on Charlie's forehead, just above his eye. Yee-ouch!
-   There's another example in _MacGyver_. In the episode "To be a Man" Macgyver's gunshot wound is cauterized with a red hot poker. He passes out from the pain.
-   _The Mandalorian_. In the second episode the title character shows he's Not So Stoic as he's heard groaning in pain as he cauterizes a wound he received from a Trandoshan's vibro-axe. Unknown to The Mandalorian, The Child he just rescued could have healed him a lot less painfully.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ 5<sup>th</sup> Edition: The Circle of Wildfire druid subclass plays into this heavily. Half of their always-prepared spells deal fire damage while the other half heal; their 6<sup>th</sup>\-level ability can give them a bonus to either healing or fire damage rolls; and their 10<sup>th</sup>\-level ability lets them create a flame which can either heal or harm.
-   _Magi-Nation_ provides the page quote, from the flavor text of one of the cards. Many of the spells and creature abilities from the Cald (the fire domain) deal with healing your creatures or rearranging their energy in general. However, this trope is averted in the Gameboy Color game based on the TCG.
-   _Pathfinder_ 1<sup>st</sup> Edition: Sorcerers of the Phoenix Bloodline can choose to cast Fire spells so they heal half the amount of Hit Points they would ordinarily damage.
-   In _Princess: The Hopeful_, Princesses of Swords have access to Charms that can literally burn sickness or poison away, while leaving the body unharmed. Similarly, the Princesses of Storms can burn away their traumas rather than having to recover in the regular fashion.
-   _Rotted Capes_ takes place in a Zombie Apocalypse, where the only sure way to keep from being infected once bitten is to cauterize the wound ASAP.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_ 4<sup>th</sup> Edition: Pyromancers can instantly heal wounds with the "Cauterize" spell. If the lucky recipient fails a saving throw, they pass out from the pain and heal with permanent scarring.

    Video Games 

-   In the \[adult swim\].com game _Amateur Surgeon_, Alan Probe, the titular pizza delivery guy turned brilliant unlicensed physician, uses a disposable lighter (and in the sequel, a match) to cauterize wounds after stapling them shut. Also to attach transplanted organs. He must be a genius, because he somehow makes it WORK.
-   In _The Binding of Isaac Rebirth_, you can get an item called Pyromaniac, which allows you to heal half a heart each time you get hit by an explosion, including your own bombs.
-   In _Borderlands_ the Soldier class has a talent called "Cauterize". It allows him to heal allies by shooting them.
-   The Thermal powerset used by Controllers and Corruptors in _City of Heroes_, which has powers like "Warmth" and "Cauterize". Aside from the names, they work like any other healing powers.
-   The Fire powerset in _DC Universe Online_ is generally more of the Kill It with Fire variety, but it does have a few abilities that heal the user, though _only_ the user as Fire is one of the Tank roles instead of a Healer.
-   One of the many lovely healing animations in _Far Cry_ involves lighting a bundle of matches and jamming it into the wound.
-   _Dark Souls II_ has the Warmth pyromancy, which places a floating ball of fire that periodically heals everything in a small radius around it, including enemies. In the _Crown of the Old Iron King_ DLC, some of the Ashen Idols use a much stronger version of this pyromancy that _only_ heals the enemies. Four of them must be neutralized in order to properly challenge the Fume Knight.
-   _Elden Ring_ has the "Flame, Cleanse Me" incantation. It cures both ordinary Poison and, more importantly, is one of the few cures for the Scarlet Rot. It's partially Cast from Hit Points, violently burning the toxins away, but it's far less damaging than the status effects it cures. It also has the unadvertised (and probably unintended) effect of healing Frostbite, since it does that tiny bit of Fire damage to you.
-   _Final Fantasy Tactics Advance_ and its sequel have an Elementalist spell that counts as Fire-elemental healing. This let it heal undead units (due to not being Holy-elemental) and heal more if the unit was weak to Fire attacks.
-   _Golden Sun_
    -   The Mars Adept Jenna possess the unique Aura line of spells that heal the entire party and fellow Mars Adept Karst uses it when she is fought. These spells were introduced in the second game to fix an oddity in the first where Karst's sister Menardi used the water-elemental spell Wish to heal herself and her partner despite fire and water being opposite elements.

-   In _Injustice 2_, Supergirl uses her heat vision to cauterize Harley Quinn's stab wound inflicted on her by Wonder Woman.
-   _League of Legends_:
    -   This is the whole thematic shtick with Milio, a support-based champion who uses his fire to heal, cleanse, and empower his allies _far_ more than using it offensively. He places fiery barriers around his allies to buff up their speed and empower their attacks with flame, creates mobile campfires that empowers their attack range, and his Limit Break releases a burst of flame that instantly heals surrounding allies and frees them from whatever status effects are inflicted on them.
    -   To a lesser extent, Kayle has the "Celestial Blessing" ability, which heals herself or an ally and gives them a useful burst of speed through purifying starfire.
-   _Lords of Magic_ gives the cauterize wound spell, which provides healing.
-   Leila Ibuki in _Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story_ can summon flames that can be either used to harm or heal; mechanically, she’s a Fire-type unit with a healing Connect.

-   In _Warlords Battlecry_, the Pyromancy spell list has an AoE healing spell called "Cauterize". It heals for 25 HP per spell level within the casting hero's command radius.
-   In _World of Warcraft_, Fire Mages have a passive ability called "Cauterize". It negates an attack that would kill the mage, heals them to 35%, and puts a Fire-typed Damage Over Time effect on them that deals 45% of their maximum health. So, basically, what would be a lethal blow is prevented, but they'll need healing soon anyway. Mages also used to have a spell called Mage Ward (formerly Fire Ward) that absorbed Fire damage, so they could prevent the damage from Cauterize.

-   Although many people used it in fanfiction already (such as _Embers_ and _Book Five: Legends_, mentioned above), in the _The Legend of Korra_ episode "Beginnings, part 1" included a Firebender using their powers to heal Korra, when that had previously been considered exclusive to Waterbending. However, there's a difference, that being that Waterbending heals people physically as well, while Firebending healing is apparently exclusively spiritual, reading chi paths and spiritual energy in a person to diagnose a problem.

    Real Life 

-   According to The Other Wiki, cauterization is mentioned in the Hippocratic Corpus. Since Hippocrates was born after 500 B.C., this one is Older Than Feudalism.
-   Cauterization exists in real life, of course, but what makes this stand out as a TV / film trope is how it is so overused. Often it is shown in situations where a real attempt to cauterize would do far more harm than good, in terms of destroying healthy tissue and increasing the risk of infection.
    -   In Real Life this was the standard practice before the technique of suturing the veins was rediscovered. More often than not, it killed the patient even if the wound wouldn't have. Pouring boiling oil into open wounds is counterproductive, most of the time.
    -   Among the main problems with cauterization is the very real risk of gangrene. The wound isn't merely closed; the veins and arteries in the area are sealed shut. This can cause more tissues to die from lack of blood, which can turn gangrenous and ultimately require amputation. What it does do, however, is buy the wounded individual time to get to a hospital, which they still have to do.
    -   Burn wounds are often treated with special military bandages and open holes in, say, the lungs are treated with bandages that seal around the wound preventing air from escaping the lung. While cauterization may help if your hand was cut off, military medical kits have tourniquets for that kind of thing. Cauterization isn't even a last resort for medics nowadays mostly because a tourniquet, while incredibly painful, can usually stay on just long enough <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  for the patient to be evacuated to a field hospital. The best-case scenario for cauterization would be you have alcohol, a blade, some burn salve and/or burn bandages, a way to heat the blade, no time to wait or any place to evacuate to, no tourniquet or sutures, and a missing appendage. In other words, extremely specific circumstances.
    -   When modern cauterization is used, it is generally electrocauterization - a probe is touched to the indicated spot and heated with an electric current. This avoids things like waving around hot metal next to an oxygen tank. There is also chemical cauterization, where the "burning" is from a reaction between the chemical and the area it is applied to.
-   One method that people use to remove leeches from themselves is to burn the leech with a lit cigarette or a cigarette lighter, which will cause it to let go. This is not recommended, since the burned leech will regurgitate its stomach contents into the bite, which creates a risk of infection. It’s better to either pry the leech off VERY gently (you do not want its teeth to be left in the wound) or just wait until it's eaten its fill and drops off by itself.
-   The tragic story of David (originally Bruce) Reimer began when Bruce and twin brother Brian's parents noticed that the infant twins were having difficulty urinating. Following a diagnosis of phimosis; the two were scheduled for circumcision, but the doctor in charge elected to use an irregular procedure of electrocauterization, only for the procedure to go wrong and end up burning Bruce's penis to a crisp; leading to the string of events that led the Reimers to Dr. John Money and the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to raise Bruce as a girl named Brenda. As it turned out; Brian was not subjected to the circumcision effort, and as things ended up; the urination problems that led to Bruce's botched circumcision ended up clearing up on its own.
