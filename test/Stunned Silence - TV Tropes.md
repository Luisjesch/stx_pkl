Azula has that effect on people.

_"A full minute of stunned silence means 'My God what did you do?' not 'Please continue'."_

Exactly What It Says on the Tin. Someone is shocked or stunned into silence.

There are two major types: Stunned amazement or stunned horror.

Often, stunned amazement causes the performer to think the audience's initial silence means they dislike the performance. The truth becomes apparent when they burst into applause. Often will lead to a Slow Clap. If in comedic fiction, bonus points if the sound of Chirping Crickets is the only audible thing.

Stunned horror can be further divided into stunned by stupidity, stunned by surreality, or stunned by realization of just how bad the situation is. The first two occur when a character says (or does) something so stupid or off the wall other characters are rendered unable to talk or limited to a single word, often a Flat "What". See also Chirping Crickets, Loudspeaker Truck (a passing vehicle makes a very loud noise to indicate awkwardness), Face Fault, and Idiot Crows. The third, obviously, is a manifestation of Oh, Crap!, often a Mass "Oh, Crap!".

If the stunned character is known as a Deadpan Snarker, it becomes an example of Sarcasm Failure.

See also Deer in the Headlights when someone is stunned by immediate, personal danger, and Shutting Up Now for a possible follow up. If this happens during a radio broadcast, it can lead to Dead Air. This usually accompanies the subject having Stopped Dead in Their Tracks.

Compare Change the Uncomfortable Subject, Shell-Shock Silence and Visible Silence.

        **Batman:** So you two got into... **trouble**? **You**? **Trouble**?

        **Batman:** ...

    A dozen camera feeds were brought up, showing a curious sight. A fleet of RC cars painted red and kitbashed to look like post-apocalyptic raider vehicles manned by Minisukas. This was accompanied by a large flock of mismatched birds of different breeds ridden by even more Minisukas.

The command center was engulfed by a stunned silence, once again due to the arrival of the tiny reinforcements.
    
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ fanfiction _Role-Playing (Evangelion)_: Neither Gendo nor Fuyutsuki are able to talk after watching Shinji reenacting the conversation where he told his father off.
    
    The commanders watched in complete silence.  
    Shock might have been an accurate description.  
    Just a total stunned pause in their daily routine.
    
-   _Invader Zim_ fanfiction _Top of the Line (Editor-Bug)_: When Zim declares his belief that Tak is in love with him in an attempt to publicly humiliate her, the whole tournament goes completely quiet and stares at him.

    -   Blue, Delta, and Echo have this reaction in Chapter 25 after Owen attempts to use the _Velociraptor_ resonating chamber to recreate their vocalizations.
    
    Owen pressed his lips when Blue turned back to him. She opened her mouth like she was going to reply, but closed her mouth as she seemed to think, then she opened it again. It was clear she was at a loss for words. Owen caught Echo and Delta sharing a brief glance before quietly staring at him. The silence was deafening to Owen. Dr. Grant finally let out a snorted laugh as he quietly said, "You have stunned your raptors into pure silence. I am truly amazed."

    Film — Animated 

-   Happens at the final performance in _Cats Don't Dance_, before the audience bursts into applause. Somewhat justified, as the audience had taken considerable abuse during the show.
-   _How to Train Your Dragon_. Gobber and most of the kids in dragon training are rendered completely speechless when Hiccup is able to force a Hideous Zippleback to get back into its cage, seemingly by just commanding it to do so.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The ending of _Babe_ has the entire crowd silent after watching Babe herd the sheep perfectly. They then erupt into thunderous applause.
-   Godzilla, of all creatures, gets one in the original _Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla_. He attacks what appears to be his exact twin with his radioactive flame. Only for the thing to have metal under its skin. Godzilla actually tilts his entire upper body in shock to one side with a general sense of his body language and expression more or less screaming _"What the Hell?!"_ Mechagodzilla gets one a few moments before when Godzilla shows up and gets a _second_ one near the climax of the film when Godzilla emerges from the ocean for round two. Despite being a machine, Mechagodzilla's sudden reaction to the churning water shows that this Mechagodzilla had some level of AI as it was almost as if it was startled by the noise. When Godzilla himself emerges, Mechagodzilla just kinda _stands there_ for a few moments. One has to wonder if it would have reacted at all if the aliens who built it hadn't then told the thing to "Beat Godzilla to Death."

Even Arthur stares at Venec in a stunned silence, but it works.
-   In _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_, when Sauron falls the main characters who are fighting at the Black Gate are literally stunned into silence. It makes more sense in the extended editions because it is revealed that the Mouth of Sauron told everyone Frodo was dead (or in the books, captured and awaiting death); it's to be expected that his victory would bring on a "Holy freaking crap, Frodo's alive!" as well as a "Holy freaking crap, we actually won!"
-   Ting's first "fight" in the underground fight club in _Ong-Bak_ results in this. Ting, who didn't even want to fight and stepped into the ring by accident, takes his opponent down with a single unbelievably fast knee to the chest. Everyone watching is shocked and speechless, aside from a crime boss who won a big bet on the fight with another kingpin.
-   Happens at the performance of _Romeo and Juliet_ in _Shakespeare in Love_ before the audience bursts into applause.
-   In _Sherlock Holmes (2009)_, Holmes is seen participating in a bare-fisted boxing match watched by a crowd loudly and savagely baying for blood. However, after Holmes — who has previously been holding back — completely beats the crap out of his opponent in six seconds in response to his opponent's ill-advised decision to spit at the back of Holmes' head, the crowd immediately goes silent with shock, except for one chap who indignantly mutters, "Where the hell did _that_ come from?!"
-   In _Spotlight_, when a psychologist says that roughly 6 percent of priests are pedophiles, the Spotlight team does some quick math and comes up with a whopping _ninety_ priests in Boston alone.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, Coulson has learned about Project T.A.H.I.T.I, an incredibly risky procedure capable of bringing a person back from death involving aliens and surgery, and which was used on him, and talks with Nick Fury about it.
    
    **Fury:** It was a "break glass in case of emergency" situation.  
    **Coulson:** Yes, but that emergency was supposed to be the fall of an Avenger!  
    **Fury:** Exactly.  
    **Coulson:** ...  
    **Fury:** And I'm damn glad I did it, too.
    
-   _Angel_: An effective use of both tension and comedy at the same time is found in the Series 4 finale. For several long moments at the start of the episode, absolutely no-one speaks. The camera pans around all six characters as each one shifts position or opens their mouth as though about to speak, but no-one does. It's clear the entire cast is absolutely stunned by whatever Lilah has just said. Lilah herself doesn't speak just waits, smug and amused, as Angel's team try and gather their wits and find their voices. Word of God reveals that it was deliberately timed to coincide with the length of time it takes for the credits to scroll across the screen as they'd once observed how long it takes and thought it would be funny to have absolutely no talking for that long if they could ever think of a plot. They thought of one.
-   _Cheers:_ The first sign that Dr. Lilith Sternin's Diane-assisted makeover has had the intended effect on poor Frasier and _more_ is that, after she's entered their TV interview, we see Fras just sitting there, staring slack-jawed at her.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_: In the season 2 finale, when Matt meets with Karen in the shuttered Nelson & Murdock office.
    
    **Matt Murdock:** Thanks for seeing me.  
    **Karen Page:** What am I doing here, Matt?  
    **Matt Murdock:** I, uh, have something...  
    **Karen Page:** No. I don't want...  
    **Matt Murdock:** I have something that I _need_ you to see.  
    _\[Matt pulls his Daredevil helmet out of a paper bag. Karen looks at him, first in confusion and then in dawning realization and shock\]_  
    **Matt Murdock:** ...I'm Daredevil.
    
-   _Doctor Who_: In "Journey's End", the Tenth Doctor has been shot by a Dalek! You know what that means! He'll regenerate, and change into a completely different person! The Doctor's companions Rose, Donna and Jack back away as he begins to glow and change — only for him to redirect his energy into his old hand and just stand there, smiling, looking completely the same. They just stare in stunned amazement.
-   _Game of Thrones_
    -   Jorah is rendered utterly speechless when he sees Daario leaving Daenerys' quarters in the morning. By the time he gets his audience with Dany, he's recovered enough to deliver a snarky comment.
    -   And there's the Mass "Oh, Crap!" moment when a drunken Tyrion Lannister, pushed to the limit by King Joffrey's petty cruelty, threatens to geld His Grace. The entire room falls silent and only Lord Tywin Lannister dares speak to defuse the situation.
-   _Sesame Street_: In the Season 17 premiere, the adults are reduced to about a half minute of amazed silence (complete with some jaw drops) when they finally get a look at Mr. Snuffleupagus in the flesh (or fur) after almost 15 seasons of being oblivious and none the wiser to his existence.
-   _Star Trek: Picard_:
    -   In "Absolute Candor", when Elnor sees Jean-Luc Picard again for the first time in fourteen years, he's so shocked that he freezes in his tracks and gapes, unable to speak.
    -   In "Broken Pieces", Rios is so stunned when Soji beams aboard _La Sirena_ that he doesn't even hear Picard's voice.

    Pinball 

-   _Pinball Magic_ incorporates this into a mode: "Silence the Critics".

    Poetry 

-   In "The Mountain Whippoorwill," a poem by Stephen Vincent Benet, the skill of the fiddler is determined by how loud the crowd applauds. Hillbilly Jim gets complete silence. When he goes to congratulate Old Man Dan, whom he thinks is the winner, Dan hands his own fiddle over, and _then_ the crowd starts to applaud. They were stunned by how good he was..

    Video Games 

-   This is extremely common in the _Ace Attorney_ games, usually when a witness says something that is either incredibly stupid or implausible or that casts supreme suspicion on them.
-   Apparently happens at the beginning of _Bioshock Infinite_ to Booker Dewitt when he first witnesses Columbia, judging from this scene.
-   In _Enslaved: Odyssey to the West_ Trip reacts that way when she sees Monkey battling Mechs for the first time.
-   In _Jak II: Renegade_, the titular character just looks on at the girl behind the curtain (later revealed to be Keira) in a romantic trance, with his mouth wide open, while Daxter attempts to get him to snap out of it.
-   _Mass Effect 2_: After Mordin Solus shows he is the very model of a scientist salarian, regardless of the player's choice of response, there's a pause between it and Shepard actually saying something, suggesting s/he's having one of these.
    
    **Mordin:** ... still prefer patter songs.

Within twelve hours of the Kickstarter opening, the critters had raised more than three million dollars, completing all of the stretch goals in less than half a day. This even got _Critical Role_ the world record for the most-funded film project ever in the site's history at the time. The result? A planned FAQ stream started with Matthew Mercer, Travis Willingham, and Marisha Ray sitting in silence, just staring at the camera. This lasts until Travis finally lets out some Tension-Cutting Laughter, causing them all to break down laughing, barely able to process what's just happened.

## Stunned Horror

    Anime & Manga

-   _Steins;Gate_: When Okabe loudly makes light of Ruka's androgynous appearance in front of the whole lab in a mid-series episode, he gets this trope as a response because in this World Line, Ruka was born a girl, making what is usually an in-joke between the two of them come off as incredibly mean spirited instead.
-   _Tenchi Muyo!_: A regular element of being around Mihoshi.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: During Joey's duel with Marik, Joey plays a card that lets him summon the bottom-most monster in his graveyard (as in, the monster that was sent to the graveyard first) unless his opponent can guess the name of it. Since Marik had earlier played a card that sends cards from Joey's hand to his graveyard at random, he has no idea what the card might be and doesn't even make an attempt, leading Joey to mention this trope by name.
    
    "Oh, I'm sorry! 'Stunned silence' was not the answer we were looking for!"
    

    Comic Books 

-   _The Avengers:_ Hawkeye's reaction to Scarlet Witch informing him, _after_ he'd forcibly kissed her, that in the time he was off having his own adventures in space she and the Vision realized they loved one another.

-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_, Keiko Nagare becomes too horrified to speak when Asuka reveals she thought about killing herself after beating Keiko up (which only happened because her mind was being tampered with, but Asuka does not know that).
    
    The words fell on Keiko's chest like an anvil. She gasped, her left hand clutching the front of her gown as if to brace herself. Her mouth hung open but she couldn't speak, leaving her to stare in terrified silence at the girl she admired—the girl whom she wanted to emulate, to grow up and be like. The haughty, beautiful, popular, courageous Asuka Langley Soryu… thought about killing herself?

    "The basic idea of it is correct," Iva agreed.  
    "This has all been done to make you into the perfect fighting machine. Would you agree with that?"  
    Iva looked as though she were being drawn into a trap, but couldn't bring herself to avoid it. "Not in those precise words, but the gist of it is valid."  
    "So what happens when they want an even more perfect fighting machine, and throw you to her as a sacrifice?"  
    Iva's jaw was open. No sound came out.
    
-   _Read the Fine Print (Evangelion)_: Shinji and Asuka become unable to speak when Rei casually says she is completely expendable.

Unfortunately, Hiro is unable to say no due to being too stunned to speak, prompting Cass to take his silence as consent.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   ECW once did a storyline involving Raven tying The Sandman to a wooden cross, then placing a crown of barbed wire upon his head. This marks the only time the ECW mutants were ever not cheering, chanting, or screaming for blood. Definitely the "silent horror" variety. They had to send Raven (who was supposed to be the bad guy in all this, keep in mind) out to apologize to the crowd afterwards. Raven, to this day, doesn't get why anyone saw a problem with it. By the way, Kurt Angle, a few months after winning an Olympic Gold Medal with a BROKEN FREAKING NECK, was there that night as a guest of Taz. He turned around and walked out on seeing this.
-   At the 2016 _Death Before Dishonor_ match, maker Nigel McGuinness, who was on commentary for the night, was at a loss for words at the sight of the bloody shards of broken table that resulted from Adam Page's "anything goes" match with Jay Briscoe.

    Video Games 

-   When the Bkjhfjdgelkans nuke themselves in _Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War_, all radio chatter stops for thirty seconds. Even the BGM stops and is replaced with quiet white noise for the rest of the mission. Coupled with the Interface Screw from the nukes' EMP, the end result is _scary_.
-   If you chose to save Doug in episode one of _The Walking Dead: Season One,_ once episode three rolls around and Lily is at the tipping point of violent suspicion as to who in the group was slipping supplies to the bandits, she quietly draws her gun and attempts to shoot Ben when no one is looking, but Doug sees it just in time to pull Ben out of the way and get shot instead. Lily goes completely still, with a look of complete shock on her face while staring at Doug's body, and silently shakes her head.

    **Shepard**: (silent facial expression of utter horror)  
    **EDI**: That was a joke.
    
-   _Mass Effect: Andromeda:_ Should Ryder nominate Nakmor Morda, a krogan so bad-tempered other krogan call her a hardass, to be an ambassador, and then go to speak to Initiative Director Tann afterward, Tann is so horrified (in part because of his _severe_ Fantastic Racism toward krogan) he can't even speak, just sputtering at Ryder.

-   Shuichi Saihara goes completely silent in _Dangan Ronpa V 3 Killing Harmony_ in Case 1 when he's accused of being the killer. Ironically, the reason he's stunned into silence isn't because he's being accused, but because he's figured out that the killer was (supposedly) Kaede Akamatsu and _really_ doesn't want to reveal the truth of her crime since they've become good friends. Kaede herself eventually talks him out of it.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links_: Played for Laughs when Serena (Celina) tells Reiji (Declan) that since she is the partial reincarnation of his older half-sister Ray, that makes Reiji her younger brother.

-   When Todd in the Shadows reviewed Chris Brown's "Deuces", Kevin McCall's line "Like Tina did to Ike in the limo, it finally hit me" caused this. And follows by asking how it remained on the song (complete with a mock conversation where Brown asks to remove the lyric because they compare him enough already with Ike Turner). He has since had more instances of that, such as another Chris Brown-related song, Lil Dicky's "Freaky Friday" ("ain't nobody judging 'cause I'm black, or my controversial past." Todd describes the subsequent silence as his brain crashing.) and Liz Phair singing "You're being a penis- colada, that is" (where his only response is a wrestling tap out).

-   When reviewing the _Are You Afraid of the Dark?_ episode "The Tale of the Dark Music", JonTron is initially confused by the ending, where the hero locks the bully in the basement with a monster.

The commercial appears to leave Critic in horrified silence, mouth agape. Subverted, in that it's actually just a cardboard cutout of Critic.
-   In _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_, in Episode 8, while the Millennium and Crusader armies are fighting and Anderson is having a stand-off with Seras, everyone abruptly halts when they hear the opening to "Ready To Die" suddenly start playing in the distance... as that's being blasted at full volume from the speakers on an aircraft carrier being sailed up the Thames River by Alucard. Everyone stops and stares in shock and fear (except Integra and Seras) because Alucard is back.
-   Happened thrice to the Producer in _Screen Rant Pitch Meetings_, upon hearing that the villains of _John Wick_ kill the eponymous character's dog (followed by "...OK, some people better die for that."), that the climactic battle of _Twilight Breaking Dawn_ was just a vision ("...what are we doing here, man?") and James Bond dying in _No Time to Die_ ("...what?!").

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Batman Beyond_ episode "Out of the Past", Terry calls Ra's al Ghul a psychopath, which results in a horrified stare by Talia — which is a hint that Ra's al Ghul had possessed Talia's body and would have _every reason_ to be horrified at the notion that people see him as a psychopath. If Terry called Ra's al Ghul in front of the _real_ Talia, she would have given him a Death Glare and more due to Talia's loyalty to Ra's al Ghul.

-   _Diabolik_: Once in a while the creators drop an episode to remind everyone that in this series everything can happen and Anyone Can Die. When they do, reader and character are left too stunned to speak. Some examples:
    -   In "Mocking Diabolik", this happens thrice: first when Diabolik and Eva learn that Ginko has moved the gold statues to the museum without Diabolik even realizing, then when they learns _how_ he did (with Eva trying to not laugh at the sheer audacity), and then, as the final panel of the issue when Ginko learns of _how_ Diabolik was listening on him (Ginko _knew_ Diabolik was listening on him and used this knowledge in his plan, but he didn't expect that Diabolik would bug the last round of his gun).
    -   In "A Killer for Ginko", we get Altea and Ginko's break-up. Something considered impossible.
    -   In "The Return of Gustavo Garian", this happens when Gustavo reveals who hired the hitmen who had (apparently) killed Diabolik: himself. Diabolik (disguised as Ginko) and the readers were left speechless... _Then_ Gustavo revealed he was terminally ill and the killers were supposed to kill him too had they been still alive, asked who he believed Ginko for his gun, and then he killed himself. Mind you, Gustavo was the oldest recurring character and the first named character to appear, even introducing Diabolik to the reader, so him being used to prove that in this series Anyone Can Die surprised even the oldest and most jaded readers.

-   Truth in Television: A particularly moving piece of music gets silence from the house. Can be a powerful, powerful compliment. On one occasion a clap began, but most of the house didn't join in, and it subsided again (it was a tribute to a dead member of the orchestra, and applause just didn't seem appropriate).

    New Media 

-   Long ago, there was a YKTTW entry with this name which described the way dramatic arguments in shows would end: one person would raise their voice and deliver a final cutting line, then simply walk out, leaving the other in stunned silence.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   This occurred when Bruno Sammartino dropped the title after a historic reign that lasted just shy of eight years, to Ivan Koloff at Madison Square Garden. Witnesses say that one could hear a pin drop after the referee made the three count, and Sammartino himself claims that the room was so silent, he thought he had gone deaf.
-   Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling's English commentary team of suggested the crowds tended to be relatively silent during matches, particularly the garbage matches, due to being stunned at what they were seeing.
-   "Stone Cold" Steve Austin had this reaction when R-Truth came out to the ring dressed as a Confederate soldier. Austin, a man who obviously never aspired to any political correctness, clearly recognized the perversity of a black man dressed up as a Confederate soldier. Considering everything that's happened in his career, that says a _lot_ about the skit.
-   Cheerleader Melissa had been on every SHIMMER volume, consistently coming ever so close to a title belt, gaining crowd sympathy in the process. After seven years she beat Madison Eagles, regarded by some to be the best wrestler in the world, for her first SHIMMER title, only to lose it two days later after Sweet Saraya ambushed her before their match. It was a bit of a buzz kill.
-   WrestleMania 30. Just these five words: Brock Lesnar Broke The Streak. _The entire arena_ was silent, and one fan's reaction even went viral; the referee and Paul Heyman even played up being shocked (or, at least, that was what it was thought at the time; as it turns out, no one but Lesnar, 'Taker, Vince, Hunter, and Steph knew the ending of the match, so their reactions were legitimate), and there was a lengthy delay before Brock's theme music hit, just to let things sink in. The crowd was virtually dead for the rest of the night, only perking up once Daniel Bryan won.
    
    Two years later at WrestleMania 32, both the crowd and even _THE UNDERTAKER_ had a mixture of this reaction and the Stunned Horror variation after Shane McMahon actually **willingly** jumped off the 20ft Cell in their "Hell in A Cell" match, trying to elbow drop Taker, only for said wrestler to roll out of the way in time. While the crowd did jump at the jump itself, the silence came as medics came to Shane, wondering if he finally managed to kill himself, all while Taker watched, eyes wide at the sight. Keep in mind, Shane's wife and three sons (The latter three having come out with him during Shane's entrance) was in the crowd in the front row.
    
-   When Jay Briscoe beat Michael Elgin in his own hometown of Toronto for the Ring of Honor World Title at ROH _All Star Extravaganza VI_, the viewers didn't know what to make of it. There was some halfhearted cheering and booing but most in attendance simply could not decide which emotion to express other than sheer disbelief, which translated to silence. Thankfully, the main event was next and the crowd was soon fired back up to see reDRagon vs The Young Bucks.
-   On October 22, 2018 _Roman Reigns_ of all wrestlers, caught everyone off guard when he revealed that he had to relinquish his Universal Title because of leukemia and that he had been fighting it for _eleven years_. By the time he revealed that the disease had returned, a person could have heard a pin drop in that arena. Doubles as a real-life example because he explicitly broke Kayfabe to make this announcement.
-   _Hell in a Cell_ 2022 had _Cody Rhodes_ begin the match by removing his Badass Longcoat...to reveal his torn pec that was completely bruised and purple like a zombie bit him. The crowd was _completely_ shocked at the severity of the injury.

    Theatre 

-   _Avenue Q_: Rod spends a whole song going on about how he is totally straight and definitely has a Girlfriend in Canada. In the end, he lets out a near-hysterical "_And I can't wait to eat her pussy again!_" For about 30 straight seconds all of the other characters, as well as the orchestra and conductor, stare at him in shock and awkwardness.

    Video Games 

-   This classic review of _Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing_ shows Alex Navarro (then working for Gamespot) losing his mind over the game's pre-pre-Alpha status.

-   _Devil May Cry 5_: Nero is stunned into silence for a few seconds when Dante reveals that Vergil (half of whom was also the Big Bad of the game) is Nero's father.
-   _Mass Effect 2_: At one point, fast-talking alien scientist Mordin performs a filk of the Major-General's Song from _The Pirates of Penzance_. Shepard stares at him in absolute stunned disbelief for quite some time. Doubly hilarious because the _Mass Effect_ series is notorious for its paused interruptions, and it looks like that's what's happening - until Mordin coughs at the end of the line.

    Web Animation 

-   _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_: The Emperor has a moment of shocked silence after Kitten's Little "No" of defiance.
-   _RWBY_: When Ozpin tries to explain that he has reasons for keeping secrets, Yang insists that they're in this together so he can share the truth with them because they'll never turn their backs on him. Ozpin demands to know if they really think that this was his first betrayal, and everything stops. The camera close-up jerks back to a long-shot of the entire group, the heroes stop arguing with him, they stop walking and even the music stops. Only the wind howls and the snow swirls in the silence that follows. Ozpin then turns to face them, revealing that another had once said the exact same words Yang had just stated; the heroes remain frozen and utterly silent.
    
    **Yang:** Look, we're supposed to be in this together! You can trust us! We're not going to turn our backs on you.  
    **Ozpin:** Do you really think Leo was the first?! That he didn't say those exact same words to me?!

    Web Original 

-   _Dream High School_ has a ton of these, mostly from Corliss.
-   In _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_, Shenron does this in _Dead Zone Abridged_ when Garlic Jr. wishes for immortality, because he can't remember the last time someone "nutted up and asked for that."
-   What happens in _Red vs. Blue_ when Washington discovers that, unbelievably, the Alpha AI was right alongside them the entire time, the revelation causes a **huge** minute of momentous silence between them both, the silence being nearly deafening during the scene after the realization that **truly embodies** this trope exquisitely...
    -   Also happens to Felix when he realizes the fight at the radio tower was a set-up for Tucker to pull an Engineered Public Confession on him. Tucker lampshades that it's the first time he's seen Felix in a state of Sarcasm Failure.
-   _The Spoony Experiment_: In his review of the cheesy 1980s movie _Ragewar_, Dr. Insano gets a look that combines annoyance with weariness when he learns that this movie is the origin of the phrase "I reject your reality and substitute my own."
-   Todd in the Shadows has at least two big cases, in "Deuces" to the line "Like Tina did to Ike in the limo, it finally hit me" (along with missing the point, rapping this when the main artist was accused of domestic abuse is very inadequate), and _Funstyle_ to the line "Uh oh, you're being a peñis\\Colada, that is" (Todd proceeds to do a wrestling tapout in his piano).

    _\[Beat\]_

    _\[Extended Beat\]_

-   _Hey Arnold!_: In "Arnold Betrays Iggy", Arnold has found out a secret about Iggy, and Sid and Stinky badger him to tell them what it was. Arnold refuses to break his promise not to tell, simply saying that it's something he wears, and Sid quips "It's wasn't like he was wearing bunny pajamas or something". This leaves Arnold struck silent, cluing them that they guessed correct.
-   _Kaeloo_: This is the others' typical reaction to Stumpy's stupidity, usually accompanied by a Sweat Drop. In Mr. Cat's case, this is also accompanied by a Twitchy Eye.
-   _Lite Sprites_: Meadow suggesting they teach a slug to do The Worm gets this response. She remembers it differently.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_ has two examples:
    -   "The Puppeteer": Hawk Moth remains paralyzed in shock for about a minute before shouting it's impossible when Ladybug defeats the titular villain against apparently impossible odds (the Puppeteer having taken control of three past villains and Cat Noir, and already having the doll she needs to do the same to Ladybug).
    -   "Santa Claws": Ladybug has this reaction when she sees the Santa Claus who she had accidentally accused to be an Akumatized villain was turned into an Akumatized villain literally _seconds after she looked the other way_. Could have been horror, as it was her fault, except she didn't get over the surprise in time before she was attacked.
-   _The Simpsons_:

    **Wander:** ...I just thought someone's foot might get cold.
    

    Real Life 

-   Subverted with Ludwig van Beethoven at the premiere of his Symphony No.9: He thought he was getting this from the crowd. Then one of the sopranos turned him around, and he saw he was getting a standing ovation, which he couldn't hear because he'd gone deaf by that point.
-   Used effectively by honor guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery. If someone/a group of people is disrespecting the tomb or area around it in any way, they will break from their walk and address them directly in a loud shout, "It is requested that everyone maintains a level of silence and **respect**!"
-   Reportedly, this was the reaction of the crowd at the end of the final match of the 1950 World Cup. The Brazilian team had been heavily favoured to win, so when Uruguay came from behind to win 2-1, the spectators (practically all Brazilian, since Brazil was hosting and the match was in Rio) were so shocked they couldn’t say anything. FIFA president Jules Rimet said that as he left the luxury box to prepare for the awarding ceremony, everyone was screaming and jubilant, but by the time he hit the pitch, it was a gravely silence. To this day the match is often called the _Maracanaço_—roughly "The Agony of Maracanã" (after the great stadium where the match was played).
-   _Star Wars_: There is an anecdote about _A New Hope_ (then known simply as _Star Wars_) in America. When people saw the first spaceship come into view, they cheered. When they saw the second one (the Imperial Star Destroyer, which never seemed to end in that shot), they all went silent.
