The Tramp: from street-smart hobo to family dog in the span of 75 minutes!

A person finds a dog or cat on its own and decides to keep it. Occasionally the animal will be someone else's who got loose, however usually they're a stray.

In real life, it is not advised to interact with stray (and especially feral) animals due to the risk of them having diseases or because they might harm you. The latter applies far more to dogs than to cats and domestic birds (such as pigeons). Dogs are more inherently and realistically dangerous and capable of killing a human, whereas the other two, the more avoidant of conflict and relatively harmless cats and the although unwary of humans and disease-carrying in high concentrations but mostly harmless pigeons, aren't.

Pets Versus Strays is not always but is very often involved in such stories.

    Animation 

-   The finale of _A Kitten Named Woof_ ends with both Woof and his best friend the puppy being adopted by two children in the city. In prior episodes, the house they live in seems occupied but we hardly see the owners, and the final episode hints that they left, abandoning the animals living there in the process.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Chi from _Chi's Sweet Home_ is a stray kitten adopted by a family. In the manga, it's subverted in that her cat family had owners to begin with, and they've been looking for their lost kitten for a while.
-   _Nuko Duke_ begins with Kei and Sasame starting their new lives in this way.
-   _My Roommate is a Cat_ explores some of the consequences of this, though both cat (Haru) and owner (Subaru) are lucky enough that the worse possible ones didn't actually happen:
    -   One of the potential problems with Subaru not taking Haru to the vet immediately was that she could be sick from living on the streets, which fortunately turned out to not be the case.
    -   Because Haru is used to food being scarce and eating what she can find immediately, Subaru ends up accidentally overfeeding her because he just fills her bowl whenever it's empty.
    -   The hyper-vigilance Haru acquired while on the streets results in her being a little hostile towards the more smothering displays of affection coming from humans, notably the youngest siblings of Subaru's childhood friend and Subaru's Manchild editor who loves cats but married a woman who's allergic to them.
    -   One of Haru's siblings also ends up becoming this and is named Hachi by his new owners.
-   _Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon_: The more pet-like Pokemon can come off as adopted pets, but almost none as strongly as Litten. It was rather fierce toward Ash (and pretty much everyone but Moani the fruit stand owner), not wanting to leave its surrogate Stoutland parent. Once the elderly dog died and the kitten had a day to work through its grief, it accepted Ash's offer to be "adopted" into his team.
-   _Josee, The Tiger, and The Fish_: The stray black cat that often wanders into Josee's house for food is named Yukichi by Tsuneo and stays in Josee's house.

    Comic Books 

-   Supergirl is prone to adopt stray cats. In _Action Comics_ #261, Kara finds a stray tabby cat and takes him in, naming him "Streaky" on the spot because of the lightning bolt-like yellow streaks on his sides. Unbeknownst to her, Streaky had been given powers because of a bizarre Kryptonite-related accident, and would become her Action Pet for several years. _Several years later_, Kara found another stray kitten scrounging around her apartment, and she right away took him to her house, naming him "Streaky" after her first cat.
-   _Asterix_: Obelix's beloved Canine Companion Dogmatix was once a stray on the streets of Lutetia (modern-day Paris), until the events of _Asterix And the Banquet_, when he spotted Asterix and Obelix coming out of a butcher shop, and followed them throughout the rest of the adventure as a Funny Background Event. Obelix didn't even notice him until the ending feast, when Dogmatix barked for the first time, and happily fed him. By the next album, Obelix had officially adopted him as a pet, and Dogmatix has been part of their adventures ever since.

-   In _Little Orphan Annie_, Annie finds a stray dog who won't leave her alone. She takes him in and names him "Sandy" to avoid him being sent to the pound.
