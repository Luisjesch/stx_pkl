_"YES! You win!_  
_NO! We don't have anything awesome to give you._  
_BUT... maybe we could assign you some random title."_

Sometimes, just beating a game isn't enough. Some of the more obsessive gamers want to know how they did. If only there was some sort of ranking system...

In comes the End-Game Results Screen, which is exactly that — a screen at the end of a game that informs you of how you did. Usually, it'll give you a letter grade or nickname or number total or something of that sort, but other times it'll just show you your stats.

Oftentimes, it just gives you your total time, which is nifty for speedrunners.

**NOTE:** This is _not_ a Gameplay Grading screen after the final boss. This is a special screen around or after the end of the game calculating your total rank.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Action Adventure 

-   _Disney's Hide & Sneak_ shows the total amount of star containers, the overall playing time and how many trick cutscenes you unlocked after the credits finished rolling.
-   _Luigi's Mansion_ gives a letter grade at the end, along with a mansion that suits said rank - ranging from a gorgeous manor to nothing at all. The Nintendo 3DS remake follows this up with an additional scene featuring future Professor E. Gadd, which judges Gooigi's performance in the new co-op mode, depending on how many ghosts he's caught and how much gold he's collected. If the player never played through the co-op, E. Gadd will instead encourage Luigi to take Gooigi along whenever he gets the chance.
-   In _Ōkami_ and _Ōkamiden_, the player gets an overall ranking after the epilogue, with grading criteria including the number of continues used and the total amount of money collected. Getting the top rank in each category unlocks goodies for New Game Plus.
-   This is a staple in the _Pikmin_ series, where a screen that pops up after the credits shows you various stats, like your playing time, how many days it took you to complete the game, how many Pikmin were born, died (and how), or survived, and in the first game, how many parts you collected.
-   _Tails Adventure_ gives your item completion percent after the credits.
-   In the _Tomb Raider_ series, from _Tomb Raider II_ to _The Last Revelation_, players are shown their final statistics at the end of the game. It was dropped afterwards.

    Action Game 

-   _Project: Horned Owl_ also has a letter grading scale at the end.

    Adventure Game 

-   _The Colonel's Bequest_ finishes with your total score, and then suggests what you could have missed. Some are easy like finding the true killer; others are a total Guide Dang It!.
-   _Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse_: After the credits, the screen displays the overall playing time, amount of tricks triggered, mirror shards collected and bonus items obtained; the latter of which can be interacted with in Mickey's room as a post-game bonus.
-   _Inculcation_ ends with a sheet of paper grading you on your completion time, amount of deaths, and amount of syringes you injected. It goes all the way to an S, as Retsupurae discovered.
-   _Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures_ shows you your "Indy Quotient" (IQ) at the end of the game, affected not only by how fast you've completed the game, but also by the difficulty level you chose.
-   _Keineged an nor_: The end screen shows you how many endings you've discovered, how many times you died, and your best time.
-   _Maptroid_: The ending screen displays your map percentage, item percentage, and clear time.
-   The _Riddle School_ games from _3_ onward give you your total time after the credits.

    Beat 'em Up 

-   The arcade _Battletoads_ gave the players their total mission time at the end.

    First-Person Shooter 

-   After Yet Another Stupid Death in _Tower of Guns_, it shows how many stat ups you got, your guns with their levels and properties, current item, character stats and more.
-   Completing an episode of _Wolfenstein 3-D_ gives you an average percentage of killed enemies, found secret rooms and collected treasure throughout the episode.

    Four X 

-   In _Civilization_, your score is presented at the end of the game and is based on a complex metric based on the difficulty and how long it took you to finish. It's used for high score ranking.

    Hack and Slash 

-   Every _Devil May Cry_ game does this, usually with a slower remix of the current game's theme playing in the background.

    Other 

-   _Nintendo World Championships_ ends by tallying your individual scores to give your final results. It's justified due to its original use in a competition.
-   _The Simpsons: Bart's Nightmare_ was all about collecting pages of Bart's report before dawn. Thus, when the game ended (either through collecting all the pages or getting a Game Over), the player is presented with Bart's letter grade (determined by how many points he got throughout the adventure), segueing into a scene with the family all looking at his grade with various reactions — an F causes all of them to angrily stare at Bart, who himself looks depressed, while an A+ causes Homer and Marge to look proud while Lisa stares in disbelief. (Maggie looks on indifferently regardless.) It should be noted, however, that getting a grade higher than B+ can only be achieved by getting all the pages with at least a score of 109,000 or more.

    Party Game 

-   At the end of a board game session in _Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival_, pressing the X button brings up a results screen that shows how many Happy Points you got throughout the game, as well as the total spaces you walked over, how many pink or purple spaces you walked over, how many Bells you earned selling turnips, and the cumulative number of Happy Points and Bells you gained or lost in Tarot Cards (which can go into the negatives if you were quite unlucky).
-   Some games in the _Mario Party_ series show line graphs showing players' statistics over the course of the board. More of the games allow you to see the number of stars/coins at the end of the game, the number of coins won in minigames, the highest number of coins reached, and the number of each space landed on by each player.
    
    -   _Wii Party_ also uses the line graph, which leads to a hilarious moment when The Runaway Guys play Spin Off and ProtonJon (who had trounced the competition) has his line _spike_ absurdly high around the time he got his big break.
    
    **Jon**: Take that, _math_!
    

    Platform Game 

-   _The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures_ and its sequel end each by showing your total time and deaths.
-   _Exit Path_ gives you your completion time and a nickname after the Mini-Game Credits.
-   _Jumper_ and _Jumper Three_ end with a screen tallying up your death counts for each sector (and in case of the first game, types of death). _Jumper Redux_ has a much more sophisticated one that shows your ranking and a jump count.
-   At the end of every _Metal Slug_ game, you're shown your score, the number of hostages you officially rescued,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and how many continues you used up.
-   The _Metroid_ series grades those who complete the game by their times and how many power-ups they have collected. _Metroid: Zero Mission_ has a special note by having different pieces of artwork shown for completing the game with less than 15% of the power-ups collected.
-   _Mighty Bomb Jack_ and _Solomon's Key_ for the NES give players a Game Deviation Value at the end of the game to measure how well they played, whether they win or lose. For some reason, 47 is the least possible value.
-   After the credits roll on _Pizza Tower_, Peppino will give the player his judgment based on your completion percentage. The higher your percentage, the more impressed he is, with "WOW" being the highest at 95%. Completing the game in under two hours gives you the "You are quick as hell!"<small>◊</small> judgment, while completing it in less than four with 95% or more gives you "HOLY SHIT!!"<small>◊</small>.
-   The Time Attack mode of _Robotnik's Revenge_ ends by giving you a letter grade based on your time.
-   _Rockman 4 Minus Infinity_ uses number totals in a variety of categories to judge your overall "hero score". Proto Man also makes a comment based on what you'd done wrong (_if_ you did anything wrong).
-   _Rockman 7 EP_ has a ratings screen during the credits just like _Minus Infinity_ to display completion and stage times, along with new screens detailing how many resources (and therefore money) you had to go through during the game.
-   The 8-bit version of _Sonic the Hedgehog_ tallies your score based on your Chaos Emerald count, lives remaining, and a bonus for going into the Special Stages (which did _not_ hold Chaos Emeralds).
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Super Mario Bros. 2_: The game's ending shows the number of levels cleared by each of the playable character. There are 20 levels in total, though it's possible to clear the game with fewer by using Warp Zones.
    -   _Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3_: The "castle" Wario ends up getting is determined by the number of coins and treasures Wario has collected over the course of the game, ranging from a birdhouse to a planet.
    -   _Super Mario Galaxy 2_: After getting _all_ the stars, the game sends a "mail" to your Wii with a congratulatory message and how much time it took.
    -   The aptly-named _Super Mario Flash_ has a variant on this — it shows all of your level scores at the end of the game.
-   _VVVVVV_ has one right before the ending that shows your trinket total, your play time, the total amount of flips and deaths, and the room with the most deaths in the game.

    Role-Playing Game 

-   The HD version of _Final Fantasy X-2_ shows the final levels of the permanent party members, number of game clears, as well as the percent completion of story quests and the creature creator. Obtaining 100% Completion will show a special thank you message.
-   This is a staple of _Kingdom Hearts_, and is referred to there as "Battle Report". In the first few games once you were here, you couldn't leave, forcing you to restart the system to reload. Later games allow you to save your game and return to the main menu.
-   _Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals_ has one after the final credits that showcases play time, party stats, and the total number of treasure chests opened by the player.
-   _Mario & Luigi: Dream Team_ features one after the ending credits. It tallies the bros' final levels, how many mushrooms you ate, your play time, coins obtained, enemies killed, etc.
-   The Grading System of _Tales of Vesperia_ naturally grades you according to how many battles you fought, how fast you fought them, how little damage you take, etc. during the game at the end. Other _Tales games_ don't quite feature a ranking, but they do show your final results, which includes maximum hit combos, gold, etc.

    Shooting Game 

-   Several shooting games give a screen showing the percentage of times you missed, how many shots you fired, and how many targets you hit.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Star Resistance_: At the end of the credits, the game tallies up all the Gameplay Grading from the previous stages to give your overall hero ranking for the game as well as providing your total score, kills and continues.
-   _Touhou Project_ shows a details screen after your game ends, showing how much of the current mode was completed, how many times you died, how many bombs you used, your score, etc. This was only present up until the eighth mainline game, _Imperishable Night_; later games do away with this screen.

    Simulation Game 

-   _Hidden Agenda (1988)_ displays an excerpt from an encyclopedia of the future that passes judgment on your presidency.
-   _No Umbrellas Allowed_: The second half of the credits tells you various stats about your shop such as the overall revenue, the number of satisfied customers, and the percentage of items appraised perfectly.
-   _Suzerain_ gives you a brief biographical summary of your character, your position on the political compass, and a list of various random statistics (both good and bad) that illustrate your presidency.

    Sports Game 

-   _Scooby-Doo! Big Air_: Once you've finished playing, the game shows your heights across all three jumps and provides a congratulatory message based on how well you did.

    Stealth-Based Game 

-   A mainstay in the _Metal Gear_ series since the original _Metal Gear Solid_, where the player's performance (e.g. completion time, alerts triggered, enemies killed, etc.) are taken into account and an appropriate rank (in the form of an animal codename) is awarded.

    Survival Horror 

-   _Cry of Fear_ does this with things like the total completion time, accuracy, enemies killed with melee attacks, etc., and includes a letter grade for the player. It's also fairly important since you can only get Simon's Book by getting an S ranking in the main game or in Doctor mode (where it's much easier to get a S rank, since you only have to beat it in 10 minutes with an accuracy above 90%, compared to what you have to do in the main game).
-   Several _Resident Evil_ games do this, also giving bonuses for high ranks.
-   _SIGNALIS:_ Time (both total and active), number of saves, number of kills, damage taken and healed, and which ending you got.
-   Most of the earlier games in the _Silent Hill_ series gave you a ranking between one and ten stars after the credits. The ranking you got sometimes also determined the power of the game's secret weapons in a subsequent playthrough.

    Third-Person Shooter 

-   _Star Wars Bounty Hunter_ gives you a ranking based on enemies killed, civilian murders, and bounties captured. It goes from Murderous Grunt to Master Hunter.

    Turn-Based Strategy 

-   _Fire Emblem_ has traditionally did this in nearly every installment to date. Generally the number of turns it took and how much gametime spent are shown during the ending. But sometimes the game will additionally track things like EXP gained or the total sum of your gold and item values.

    Wide-Open Sandbox 

-   _Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop_ gives a ranking at the end, with bonuses.
-   _Postal 2_ ends with a screen showing all your various stats — how many people you've killed, gallons of piss you've let loose, number of people set on fire, how many cops you've distracted with donuts, how many doors you've kicked in, stuff like that. It ends with a random title indicating how bloodthirsty you were (with "cheating" added in front of it if you cheated); the game congratulates you with "Thanks for playing, JESUS!" if you managed a Pacifist Run.

## Non-video game examples:

    Game Book 

-   The Nintendo Adventure Books all had a method of tracking one's score throughout the game, ending by giving the player a rank (here<small>◊</small> is one such example, from the first book).
