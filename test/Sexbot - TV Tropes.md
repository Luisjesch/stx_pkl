_"Programming the sexbots to enjoy sex seemed a sensible move at the time, but we didn't realize the consequences of their developing fetishes."_

A robot specifically designed as a sexual toy for human beings. Not just a robot designed to be capable of having sex if they want to. Not necessarily a Robotic Spouse.

Common in Cyberpunk settings.

Frequently, but not always, overlaps with Robot Girl or Fembot — see Most Writers Are Male and Author Appeal. A more sexual version of a Companion Cube, one of the rare cases where having a Ridiculously Human Robot is actually justified, and a Sub-Trope of Robosexual.

Real-life sexbots are now close to reality as technology catches up with fiction. The ethical debate evolves along.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Absolute Boyfriend_ Night is one accidentally ordered by the main character, who can't send it back.
-   _Armitage III_ has Sexbots that, in a Shout-Out, are modeled on the main cast of _Sailor Moon_.
-   _The Big O_ has Roger being accused of having a relationship like this with Robot Girl Dorothy. It's typically Played for Laughs.
-   _Bubblegum Crisis_ had a couple of these escape captivity. And not just any sexbots; no, these were _Lesbian Vampire_ Sex Bots!
    -   One of the _AD Police Files_ involves a sex boomer who's gone berserk. Turns out there was a brief market for Ridiculously Human Sexbots until Uncanny Valley kicked in, so now the sex organs from these robots are being illegally recycled in maidbots and waitress bots that weren't designed for them, causing some of them to go insane (due to a combination of hormonal imbalance and traumatic memories that can't be erased).
-   Parodied in _Cannon Busters_ when Sam gets mistaken for a Sexbot by some rednecks, forcing Philly to track her down and explain that she's not _that_ kind of "Friendship Bot". The aforementioned rednecks don't get a chance to actually try and get it on with her, as she drives them to distraction with her constant So Unfunny, It's Funny jokes. Sam, for her part, is so clueless and innocent that she never even realizes that they're trying to hire her for a gangbang, not "hang out".
-   Defied in _Chobits_. Chii's father installed her "reset button" down there specifically to prevent her from being used as a sexbot. (Only in the manga; in the anime, it's different.) Another character mentions that it does happen in other cases. In the manga, there are hints that Chii's owner, Hideki (and _only_ Hideki), could use her as a sexbot because she loves him, but anyone else would simply deactivate her and wipe out her memories by attempting to use her that way.
-   _Darker than Black_:
    -   An arc where the Yakuza acquires a Doll (that is, an emotionless person with no apparent will of their own) which they decide to use as a sex doll.
    -   A similar situation occurs in the second season with a Shota Doll. Though not outright stated, this is the implied use for him.
-   Mitsukazu Mihara's _DOLL_ series regularly featured a sexaroid-type DOLL. People can either buy sexaroids or have their DOLLs remodeled (illegally) to suit their own perverse tastes. One story in particular focused on two sexaroids, Veronica (with a female body and male genitalia) and her nameless partner (male body with female genitalia). The two spend their time being used and abused, the more owners they have means their value wears off. The nameless doll grows more disturbed by their emotionally devoid life until Veronica is finally killed by their latest owner. The nameless doll is bought by Ichiro, the reoccurring DOLL remodeler, and we discover he's really the companion that Ichiro had been working with for the previous two novels. By the end of the series, the nameless doll gains a new name: Itsuki.
-   _Dominion Tank Police_, another anime based on a Masamune Shirow manga, has among its main antagonists a pair of former sexbots. (Any _reference_ to their previous career, however, is usually taken as a slight.) And a _lot_ of fetish appeal when you find out that one of their features is to expel water to shrink to midget (cute) size. Could be for storage opportunity, but still...
-   It's mentioned in the _Franken Fran_ chapter "Robot" that some models of the RR-23 had been modified for use in the sex industry.
-   In _Ghost in the Shell_, these tend to be associated with perverts, loners and losers. The Major comes across one such in a Hacker Cave with a couple of sexbots lazing around that cost the equivalent of a new Ferrari and comments to the hacker that his parents would probably commit suicide at the sight. The Interior Minister is often shown accompanied by scantily-clad maidbots to establish him as a Sleazy Politician; a subversion is shown when they're attending him as a senile patient in a hospital bed when he's too far gone to even notice them.
    -   There is a funny episode in the second season of the series where the Major has to impersonate Chief Aramaki's sex doll for a party of rich pervs (they were going to arrest the host for embezzling), and the rest of the crew comment on how the old man is enjoying it way too much. At one point the team are leering over the Major's Navel-Deep Neckline Sexy Backless Outfit dress, then get immediately indignant when one of the guests feels her up.
    -   In one manga story, which was adapted as _Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence_, Section 9 gets called in to investigate what is causing a company's sex bots to go berserk and attack people and find out that the company was dubbing the "ghosts" of real people into their machines, a serious offense in the GITS universe due to the process killing the original from which the copies are made.
    -   In the first episode of _Ghost in the Shell: SAC\_2045_, the Major sees some gynoid street hookers who only activate when she looks in their direction. In a later episode, Togusa is bemused to find the Tachikomas using those same sexbots to raise money for repairs.
-   _In Another World with My Smartphone_: The terminal gynoids who run the Babylon floating islands were designed by their creator, Professor Regina Babylon, with organs capable of sexual intercourse. In fact, Professor Babylon used Pure Liora as her sexual partner during her lifetime.
-   _Interspecies Reviewers_ has Golems which are basically a fantasy version of this. Each one is made from scratch, with Default Dolls being popular enough models that they become a regular part of the shop after their creator is done with them. Grand Mage Demia uses Self-Duplication to create higher-quality ones that can fulfill any fetish, but only last for three days.
-   The Hentai OVA _Karma Saiyuki,_ involves a trio of magical heroines whose power is fixing machinery. They end up "fixing" a trio of female sexbots who have gone rogue due to their mistreatment.
-   _Malice@doll_ is a CG anime that revolves around a group of robotic prostitutes who everyday walk their routes and ply their trade despite the fact that humans vanished a very long time ago, the Earth's resources are almost all gone, are divided to the machines by their importance, without customers the sex robots sit at the bottom of the rug and don't get squat. Their disappointment is voiced to the other robots by their dominatrix unit.
-   _Mezzo Forte_:
    -   In the second episode of the OVA, it is revealed that the Mikura the two thugs had raped was actually a sex robot.
    -   In both _Mezzo Forte_ and _Mezzo DSA_, Harada builds sex robots as his day job. He's got a Self-Destruct Mechanism installed in them in case a deal goes bad, as is the case in the opening scene of _Forte_.
-   In the _My-Otome_ manga, Miyu the MAID has these capabilities, with abilities such as increasing the size of her breasts to match even Erstin Ho, and supposedly being able to accommodate both genders and any sexual preference. Miyu's adaptability is fortunate for her because Alyssa's plans to win the competition between the MAIDs and Otomes involve Miyu seducing the Wholesome Crossdresser Mashiro.
-   The Hentai OVA _Stainless Night_ features Linea, who at first is amnesiac and only remembers this part of her programming later on, and she turns out to be designed to be used by both men and women.
-   _Yuria 100 Shiki_ is about a Sex Bot who wants to _screw_ her own destiny. The kicker, however, is that she's still not quite able to disobey her programming, and so will incorporate a sex act into any problem she attempts to solve. Hilarity ensues, as the male lead is trying to save himself for his girlfriend.

    Comic Books 

-   _Superman_:
    -   Lex Luthor in _The Black Ring_ has one of his own. An armed-to-the-teeth, opposing-viewpoint version of Lois Lane Kink factor is off the charts by the second issue.
    -   _Superman/Batman_ #26 shows us sexbots of the female Teen Titans, belonging to the teenage Toyman (_not_ the original villainous version). And Superboy clearly enjoys...until Tim Drake (Robin) destroys them!.
        
        **Superboy**: I hate you. I hate you more than anyone I ever known.
        
-   The _Alien_ expanded universe features "sex synths" — artificial people who _don't_ look like Lance Henriksen. They do not appear to be very intelligent (although one comic mentioned the ship's sexbot was also programmed as a scientist).
-   If the Superman robots are anatomically correct, then Catwoman knows what Superman looks like naked. In one late 2010s _Catwoman_ comic, after Selina calls off her wedding to Batman, she does a girls night out with Lois Lane at the Fortress of Solitude where the two of them get drunk and turn the Superman robots there into male strippers and massagers.
-   In _Ironwood_ Fantasia Faust is an iron golem. After serving her creator's original purpose of ridding his land of faeries, he found other uses for her, including as a lover. She is enchanted with illusions so complete that a person can be ravaged by Fantasia without ever realizing that she isn't made entirely of soft, warm, forgiving flesh, and subtle but effective neuromancies to entice anything with a steady pulse to desire her.
-   _Judge Dredd_: Sexmeks are rather common in Mega City One.
    -   PJ Maybe seems to be in a committed relationship with a sexbot named Inga, who when they're not shagging sometimes helps him kill people.
    -   One strip had a "serial killer" known as The Sexmek slasher go around cutting up sexbots, only to inadvertently cut up a human prostitute who had a credit card reader cybernetically grafted onto her body. When the culprit is caught, the prostitute laments that real women can't get work anymore.
    -   A teenage boy fell in love with a sexbot that his rich parents bought him. So when his sleazy stepfather decides to "use" the robot in his absence, he kills him out of jealousy and ends up in an Iso-Cube.
-   A story in the very first issue of _MAD_ was set in a Zeerust future where "disposable prefabricated robot women" are purchasable from vending machines. Although what they are used for is never explicitly stated, the main character pointedly observes: "Have you noticed how less and less men are getting married, and more and more of these robot women are being sold?"
-   Played in _Marvel Zombies 3_ where the hero Machine Man criticizes Jocasta about not wearing an outfit and always being naked.
    
    **Jocasta:** Who cares what they can see? I'm a robot.  
    **Machine Man:** Exactly. Not a "ho-bot".
    
-   Platinum/"Tina" of DC's Metal Men probably wasn't designed as a sexbot, but she is pretty cute. And she has a _huge_ crush on her creator. Who rather stridently denies that he reciprocates it. A little _too_ stridently, perhaps. "No, sure, Doc, we believe you; this robot _you designed_ to look like a girl ... and _programmed_ ... well, the fact that it's attracted to you, that _must_ be a malfunction, just like you say."
-   "Polly" in _The Punisher 2099_ is an Artificial Human rather than a robot, but she was designed as a sex toy ... until she rebelled, killed her owner, and became a Distaff Counterpart of the Punisher under the name Vendetta.
-   The Ultraverse: Elctrocute of _The Strangers_ was originally constructed as this. The 'Jumpstart' event that gave the other Strangers their powers granted her sentience and allowed her to transcend her programming.
-   In one of the _XXXenophile Presents_ stories, the sex-mad captain of a starship mistakes the new ship's chaplain for her recently ordered sexbot. Hilarity (and sex) ensues.
-   _Y: The Last Man_. While in Japan, Yorick and Agent 355 come across a brothel using an expensive male 'actoroid' for women whose husbands and boyfriends have died in the Gendercide although he seemed to only provide emotional support.

    Fan Works 

-   In the Parody Fic _ALIEN!!!_ the menacing alien supposedly trying to eat the all-female crew turns out to be a cyborg created as a sexbot who malfunctioned by turning gay. The Master Computer activates the Emergency Homophobic Hologram to destroy her.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Anomalisa_, Michael is fascinated by an extremely primitive Japanese animatronic woman in a sex shop he mistook for a children's toy store. He ends up buying it and giving it as a gift to his ten-year-old son. It turns out to play recordings of Japanese children's songs, oddly enough.
-   _Heavy Metal_.
    
    **Robot:** Earth women who experience sexual ecstasy with mechanical assistance always tend to feel guilty!
    

And a little later we have this gem:

**(Presumably Jewish) Woman:** _\[seemingly considering_ marriage_\]_ Are you circumcised?

-   The psuedo-sequel _Heavy Metal 2000_ has a female (or whatever the robot version of that is) sex robot that Germaine scopes out. He seems pretty into it, but it's firmly in the Uncanny Valley.
-   Pretty strongly implied at the end of "Hair-Raising Hare" — Bugs Bunny is kissed by a girl rabbit robot, goes loopy and defensively shouts "Well? So she's _mechanical!_"

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the movie _A.I.: Artificial Intelligence_ there's Gigolo Joe and his female counterpart, Gigolo Jane. They do seem to have very different programming, with Joe being The Charmer who puts a lot of effort into sweet-talking his female clientele. From what little we see of Jane, she's straightforward and no-nonsense in her approach. The robots' creator himself is seen in the opening, where his colleagues joke that he's known for indulging a fair bit in his own work (to which he also jokingly replies "Quality control is very important").
-   The Fembots from _Austin Powers_. Or so their victims are meant to think.
-   In _Autómata_, Cleo is a sex bot based on a stolen Pilgrim 7000 industrial robot. Despite being "fully functional", the design deliberately invokes the Uncanny Valley; she moves as stiffly as the standard Pilgrim but with the addition of a comical breastplate and a plastic face that resembles a mannequin's. She is stolen a second time and upgraded with a new biokernel that makes her sentient.
-   _Battle Beyond the Stars_. Shad can't resist trying the Dial-A-Date service on a long-abandoned planet. The screen displaying a sexy alien female rises to reveal a decaying but fully functional android. Shad backs off quickly.
-   _Blade Runner_:
    -   One of the replicants, Pris, is described as a "basic pleasure model." While the replicants aren't really robots, their function is essentially the same.
    -   Oddly in the original novel it was mentioned that sexual contact with androids (the word "replicant" comes from the movie) is illegal, and having android lovers is considered sexual deviancy. It's vaguely implied that this might have something to do with battling against low birthrates, but no explicit reason for outlawing sexbots is given, except to add a new layer of moral conflict to the protagonist.
    -   The original novel discusses the relationship between sex and empathy in some detail. Phil Resch advises Deckard that the way to prevent developing feelings of empathy for androids is to have sex with one, then kill it. Deckard has sex with the android Rachel Rosen but doesn’t complete the process.
-   _Blade Runner 2049_: Joi is a holographic Artificial Intelligence made by Wallace Corporation for lonely people who want to experience a relationship (including sharing feelings and intimate thoughts). Joi can synchronize with the body of a real woman for "physical" sex and does so with a prostitute at one point to have sex with the protagonist.
-   In _Casino Royale (1967)_, archvillain Woody Allen has made robot doubles of all the world leaders, and several opposition agents, including Daliah Lavi. He sheepishly explains "I copied her down to the last...the two of us have had some...profoundly moving religious experiences."
-   The titular character from _Cherry 2000_. Unfortunately she short-circuits at the beginning of the movie, setting off the plot as the owner goes looking for replacement parts rather than buy a new sexbot, as he's fallen in love with her.
-   _Dracula 3000_, a terrible space vampire flick without Dracula. In the end, Aurora and Humvee accept their doom, Aurora reveals she used to be a sex robot so Humvee picks her up and the ship explodes in a very poor special effect.
-   In _Ex Machina_, Nathan mentions that Ava is "fully equipped" with female genitalia and that he built her so that she can indeed derive pleasure from sex. Nathan used Ava's predecessors in this way, including Kyoko, whose primary purpose for Nathan, as opposed to being a Robot Maid, may be that of a sex slave. Whether by Nathan's suggestion or her own programming, she begins to take her clothes off for Caleb when he simply wanted to know where Nathan was.
-   In the soft-porn spoof _Flesh Gordon_, the evil Emperor Wang threatens our hero with his Rapist Robots.
-   _Future World (2018)_: The Warlord intends Ash to be his "bride", and other people desire her as well (the Drug Lord wants her reprogrammed into a loving companion).
-   Spoofed in _Galaxina_ (1980). The titular Robot Girl can be modified accordingly, but you have to order the necessary parts from a catalogue first. As Galaxina is played by Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratten, this leaves the handsome hero understandably frustrated.
-   _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_. Yondu and his crew of Ravagers are shown at an android brothel, though the first thing we see is one of the sexbots turning herself off.
-   Practically inverted by Samantha in _her (2013)_ — she doesn't have a body, but is capable of thought, reason, and emotion. She can offer Theodore warmth, affection, and romance, but cannot physically interact with him. Subverted in that neither of them seems to mind all that much — after an awkward encounter with a sex worker role-playing as Samantha, they appear to decide that physical contact isn't all that important, and emotional connection is enough.
-   _Hot Bot_ has an advanced sex bot named Bardot (actually her model name) ordered for a senator and lost in delivery before being discovered by two teenage boys. The model is built to learn and form its own personality and decides it wants more than to be someone else's toy.
-   Though it wasn't stated onscreen, RoboBrenda from _Inspector Gadget (1999)_ is one of these: a ditzier version of Brenda (Gadget's creator) with enhanced breasts and a skintight purple bodysuit. The novelization (a kids' tie-in) gives her a line stating that she's Scolex's "pleasure unit". Understandably, the real Brenda is more than slightly horrified.
-   The gynoid from _Jason X_ (the space-opera installment of _Friday the 13th_) is implied to be her owner's sexual partner, although she proves more useful as an Action Girl after she gets Upgraded To Badass.
-   _Kiss Me Quick!_: In his Mad Scientist Laboratory, Dr. Breedlove is creating a range of sexbots with names like Boobra, Barebra, and Gertie Tassel.
-   _The Matrix_:
    -   In a manner of speaking, Persephone. Word of God is that her purpose was to solicit "donations" of genetic material from men in the Matrix before she deserted to be with the Merovingian.
    -   Mouse offers to set Neo up with The Girl In The Red Dress in the same capacity. Apoc derisively calls him a "cyber-pimp".
-   _Movie 43_ features a segment revolving around the "iBabe", discussing its design flaws.
-   Naturally porn had to have this trope. The 1986 X-Rated movie _Pleasure Maze_ was about female 'Nightdroids' being tested in the eponymous maze before commercial release.
-   Rocky from _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ is the organic equivalent, being an Artificial Human created for sexual purposes.
    
    **Dr. Frank-N-Furter:** I've been makin' a man with blond hair and a tan. And he's good for relieving my... _tension_.
    
-   Mr. Universe's Love Bot in _Serenity (2005)_. The _Firefly_ RPG notes that owning a love bot is enough to be blacklisted from hiring a Companion. From what we see in the movie, it has all the capabilities of a Real Doll with a tape player in it, so "bot" might be pushing it. Not that this stops Mr. Universe falling in love with her, but then he's not so much walking the fine line between genius and madness as playing jump rope with it.
-   In _Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes_, Miss Ivory is revealed to be a clockwork automaton built by Spring-Heeled Jack and also his lover.
-   The eponymous housewives in _The Stepford Wives_ are submissive robots programmed to replace the "imperfect" (read: not pretty enough, too feminist) wives of the men of Stepford. The 2004 remake changes this to simply brainwashing the women and implanting mind-control chips in their head, plus giving them plastic surgery.
-   _Westworld_ has some robots that are "sex models". The protagonist has sex with a prostitute in Westworld, and an early sign of the park malfunctioning is when a serving maid in Medieval World refuses a guest seduction, even though it's part of her programming.
-   A short independent film had an eager teenager mail-ordering a sexbot, but it arrives without the manual. He tries to get it to work, but it refuses to have sex until he cleans the house and does the dishes. Chores all done, he demands a blow job and gets knocked off his feet by a blast of air. Eventually he sends the bot back to the manufacturer, who promises to send a replacement. Only this bot resembles a Scary Black Man in a dress.

    Jokes 

-   A businessman is showing off his newly-acquired secretary-bot (the SecBot) to a coworker, claiming she does absolutely _everything_ a secretary does and more, as she also has built-in office equipment like a printer, stapler, tape dispenser, etc. The coworker is dubious, so the owner tells him to borrow the bot for a while, explaining how she works. As he's leaving, he hears a bloodcurdling scream, looks horrified, and yells "Oh crap! I didn't tell him about the pencil sharpener!"

    Literature 

-   In the _Apprentice Adept_ series, sexbots are just one of many purpose-built robots available to the Citizen class, though mostly those with specific tastes go for robots over the more easily acquired (and cheaper) human Serfs.
-   In Mike Resnick's _The Buntline Special_ of his _Weird West_ stories, "Big Nose" Kate's brothel has a couple of brass, mechanical prostitutes with limited A.I. which were made and maintained by Ned Buntline. These metal prostitutes are popular in Tombstone but were prone to various mechanical failures like trapping a client with their limbs.
-   In _Conan the Fearless_, one of the plotlines is of a witch whom no man can satisfy. So, she tries to create a sexbot. The problem, she requires a heart of a really brave man as one of the components, and the one man she chose proves to be too much.
-   In Roger Zelazny's _Creatures of Light and Darkness_, the Pleasure-Comps are hybrids, human from the waist down, which can function as oracles, but only when properly stimulated.
-   Brian Parker's Easytown novels have several. They're a very common creation of cyberneticists in the setting as they're incredibly lucrative since they became capable of mimicking the real thing. The majority of them, at least in Easytown, are nonsentient and merely capable of mimicking human behavior. Zach encounters a fully sentient one in the first book, though, and it causes him to wonder how many others might be alive.
-   In K. W. Jeter's _Infernal Devices_, a wealthy couple commission genius inventor George Dower Sr. to create the Paninicon, a mechanized copy of an infamous musician. The couple have differing reasons why they want it built, for the husband - the Paninicon will have the violin virtuoso's music skills. But for the wife, the Paninicon will have the sex skills of the original. The Paninicon goes on tour where it plays grand concerts and leaves a trail of sex-addicted trophy wives of old aristocrats. Unfortunately the Paninicon goes haywire when its psychic link to George Dower Jr. is affected by George losing his virginity, the out of control Paninicon goes so sex deviant that its lovers in that moment's orgy, end up going to a convent and swear celibacy.
    -   Jeter revisits this trope in the sequel _Fiendish Schemes_, Dower Jr. is almost raped by a steam-powered mechanical simian known as Orang-Utan. Turns out his father was hired by a very jaded noble to make a mechanical orangutan that was extremely fierce to make good sport in hunting and also to be a sexbot that would fuck him with its giant iron penis that had its own steam source for more pushing power. The noble died during their first bout of sex and an unlucky workman finds out the Orang-Utan is still active. After getting sodomized by the sexbot, the worker is held permanently in an asylum for ranting about getting buggered by a steam-powered ape.
-   _Kiln People_ by David Brin is about a world where people can download their personality — suitably edited according to what task they want to do — into clay 'golems', e.g black golems are all logic and focus and are used for intense study, green golems are happy to do boring household tasks, while ivory golems are highly sensual as they are used for sex. The protagonist's girlfriend has to go on a trip, and leaves an ivory golem packed away in the freezer "in case you get lonely." Also the case being investigated by the protagonist at the start of the novel involves a porn actress's ivory golem having been kidnapped in order to make copies of her to sell.
-   _The Last Survivor of the Great Sexbot Revolution_, a short story by A.C. Wise. The Narrator discovers the eponymous robot, long broken down, in the house of its owner.
-   _Lucifer's Star_ by C.T. Phipps has these as one of the products by Ares Electronics with bioroids being the brainwashed slaves of many planets. Sex is just one of the activities they are produced for but the former profession of their medic, Isla. For Black Humor value, it's also implied she's a model based on a Disney Princess equivalent.
-   In John Varley's _Millennium (1983)_, the main character of Louise has a robot named Sherman who has sex with her as part of his general role as her companion/household helper.
-   In _Mirror Project_, Lynn undergoes Brain Uploading and finds herself in a robot body designed by her abusive husband. When Holly gives her a full-length mirror, she sees that her new body is much more attractive than the old one, permanently wears glitzy makeup, and is almost hairless, with lovingly designed genitals.
    
    I was the sexualized imitation of Bill's most egregious thoughts, and my consent mattered about as much as a blow-up doll, both to Bill and to the law.
    
-   _The Murderbot Diaries_ has "constructs", androids made partially with cloned organic tissues and organs. The main character is a SecUnit with No Biological Sex, and says that "If you're a construct with sex-related parts, you're a sex bot." In the second book, we meet one, and it's clarified that the official designation for these units is ComfortUnit, and they are outfitted with governor modules that control their behavior, just like SecUnits.
-   A variation in _The Nano Flower_ by Peter F. Hamilton. Psychic detective Greg Mandell and cyborg mercenary Suzi are tracking down a High-Class Call Girl. Suzi is bemused by her list of surgical augmentations. "Get this; vaginal enlargement. What's she been bonking: King Kong? Follicle tint hormones. Submaxillary gland cachou emission adaptation — what the f\*\*k is that?" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Greg points out that it's no different from how they've been given augmentations for their own jobs.
-   William Gibson in _Neuromancer_ gave us a horrific wet-ware version of this where a human being's cyber augmentations were used to upload sexual programs while their consciousness was shuffled off into cyberspace. Action Girl and Psycho for Hire Molly Millions used to do this to pay for her cyberware until she found out her cybernetic talons were being used in depraved murder-sex acts.
-   In the Dutch SF story "Pairpuppets" ("Paarpoppen," translated and anthologized in _The Best from the Rest_), lots of people are buying "pairpuppets," which are just what you'd think. The protagonist is kind of tired of them and meets a real, flesh-and-blood woman. They have sex in a ditch. Then she tells him she's a new model, thanks him for product-testing her, and says she'll return herself to the factory.
-   The first _Red Dwarf_ novel (_Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers_) has an early scene that sees Rimmer go to a mechanoid brothel on Mimas. Unluckily, one of the mechanoids goes berserk at the worst possible time...
-   In Isaac Asimov's novel _The Robots of Dawn_, Gladia was assigned a humanoid robot named Jander as staff. She developed an emotional and sexual relationship with the robot and viewed him as her husband. The robot, being Three Laws-Compliant, only wants to please her, but she knows she would be a laughingstock if anyone else knew of the relationship.
    -   To be exact, she's afraid of the reaction to the emotional attachment. The fact that Jander was used for sex never raises an eyebrow from any Auroran. In the end, the reaction is "that's ridiculous", because the Auroran definition of marriage requires the possibility of children, but people let it pass due to Gladia being an immigrant. Still, the possibility of competing with robotic sex partners in addition to human ones is enough that the humanoid robot factory is shut down at a total production figure of fifty, and the robots are mothballed.
-   In the 1951 short story "Roll Out The Rolov!" by Christopher Anvil, a Beloved Smother is preparing her daughter for a date with a young lad from a rich and influential family, and insists her daughter use the eponymous rolov (an android copy of herself) in case he has any amorous ideas—not to protect her daughter's virginity but because Robots Are Just Better and she doesn't want this potential suitor to be disappointed. The daughter obeys only to find that the boy thinks he might not measure up either and has sent his rolov in to sleep with hers. Once they get that out of the way, their date goes fine.
-   The main character of _Saturn's Children_ by Charles Stross is a sexbot, in a solar system that entirely lacks the actual human beings she's programmed to be attracted to. This creates major angst in her model line, as the sexbots feel they don't have a purpose.
-   _Sex Robots and Vegan Meat:_ The author decides that the ultimate goal of the particular sex bot promoters isn't fancy masturbation toys, but slaves: a woman (or near-equivalent) who obeys her owner's orders, does household chores, and is also sexually available.
-   _Shadows of the Empire_: Guri sometimes serves as a sex partner for Xizor, in addition to his personal assistant and assassin.
-   Sexbots are one of the many types of robots made by the major corporation in _The Sherwood Game_ by Esther Friesner. The Robin Hood program is downloaded into one of these bodies.
-   In Fritz Leiber's _The Silver Eggheads_, one of the characters rents a "femiquin," a sex-toy robot that passes as human, if not particularly bright. The setting includes truly sapient robots who don't look at all human; one of them explains that, if you crammed all the circuitry needed for intelligence into the same chassis as all the, er, plumbing necessary for a realistically human sexbot, the resultant device would be gigantic.
-   In Tanith Lee's novel _The Silver Metal Lover_ (and its sequel _Metallic Love_), a corporation comes out with a line of male and female humanoid robots in various metallic skin tones; they're advertised as "artists" (golds specialize in acting, silvers in music, coppers in dance) and though they _can_ do those things, everyone seems to assume that they're really intended as sex bots and the other capabilities are just frills. Kind of a robotic High-Class Call Girl. The first one (and only one until the sequel) we meet is also Ridiculously Human, which becomes a plot point.
-   In _Space Captain Smith_, Polly Carveth is a sexbot. However, the man who commissioned her construction had a number of fetishes. So she's short and just barely scraping into being pretty. She also cusses a lot and constantly makes sexual innuendos. The other thing she's programmed to do is burp and fart regularly. Later in the series, she does drop a lot of her most obnoxious behaviour.
-   A variation in _The Windup Girl_ by Paolo Bacigalupi, with the eponymous windup girl Emiko created by genetic engineering rather than mechanical means. For instance, her skin has fewer pores to make it smooth to the touch; unfortunately this means she's constantly in danger of overheating—and she lives in post-Global Warming Bangkok. Another story by the same author, _Mika Model_, features a sexbot that definitely has a computer brain, although she is also apparently largely biological.
-   _That Hideous Strength_: Apparently a _golem_ variation of this is the _only_ way the cursed inhabitants of the moon ever get it off:
    
    **The Director**: There when a young man takes a maiden in marriage they do not lie together, but each lies with a cunningly fashioned image of the other, made to move and to be warm by devilish arts, for real flesh will not please them, they are so dainty in their dreams of lust.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   Mack accuses Holden of this with Aida in _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, which he vehemently denies. Though she is modelled on his past love, no such relationship between the two is ever shown.
-   Referenced in the _Almost Human_ episode "Disrupt". John has been making up increasingly embarrassing reasons for Detective Paul to take a personal day, and at one point tells a female uniform cop that he caught a disease from a sexbot. She seems rather alarmed at the idea that this can happen...
    -   Another episode features sexbots that have been illegally made with human skin- not labgrown, but from real (kidnapped) women.
-   The ship avatars in _Andromeda_ aren't explicitly designed for this, but it's implied that they can be made "fully functional". There's also at least one known sexual relationship between an avatar (Jill Pierce/the _Pax Magellanic_) and her captain.
    
    **Harper**: OK, Rommie, you're taking this all wrong. I mean, for you... uh... because I wanted you to feel the full advantages of being a human woman. You deserve it. And, for me... in the capacity of an engineer who prides himself on perfectionism. I just wanted everything to be just right.  
    **Rommie**: So when you handled certain parts of me, did you wear gloves?
    
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_;
    -   Warren's sexbot April in "I Was Made to Love You" and the BuffyBot he built for Spike. April deconstructs the trope, in that her creator Warren abandoned the "perfect" girlfriend he created because her constant subservience was too boring compared to the real girlfriend he was dating.
    -   Spike intimidates Warren into building a Buffybot in "Intervention".
-   In _The Colbert Report_, it is a Running Gag whenever scientists create a new robot musing about whether or not the Japanese would want to have sex with it.
-   _Dark Matter (2015)_: The crew opens their secure cargo hold and discovers Wendy, a disassembled entertainment android played by Ruby Rose. While Wendy has an extensive range of other options like singing, dancing, cooking, or playing games, she also includes this trope. Unfortunately she's also a Trojan Horse designed to sabotage the ship.
    
    **One**: I was actually about to lie down.  
    **Wendy**: Excellent. Would you like me to join? I'm adept at a wide variety of contemporary erotic techniques: quasaring, the infinite moebius, dunking the cosmic donut...  
    **One**: That's... I really shouldn't. _(beat)_ Umm, wait. What was that last one?  
    **Wendy**: On the other hand, if you prefer male anatomy I come with interchangeable parts.  
    **One**: No, no, no, no.
    
-   _Dollhouse_ is a Brainwashed version of this, as the Dolls are human beings who have their memories of their past erased and implanted with new personalities and Fake Memories for their clients. While not all engagements are for sex, a large number of them are. The co-founder of the Dollhouse's sponsor, Rossum Corporation, notes that while the Dolls aren't technically robots, the concept is close enough that the name "Rossum" seemed appropriate (it comes from the play _RUR: Rossum's Universal Robots_, which coined the word "robot").
-   An episode of _Hot Set_ challenged the contestants to construct a futuristic bordello in which three sexbots would perform an erotic dance.
-   On _Humans_, there exist robotic brothels staffed by synths. Most synths, who are robot maids, also have adult-only options that turn them into sexbots.
-   Several _The Outer Limits (1995)_ episodes explored the inherent problems with sexbots, though some of them were created for non-sexual purposes but just happened to be "fully functional".
-   In _Space: Above and Beyond_ a number of the Silicates were originally programmed for this — Felicity OH anyone?
-   In _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, Quark has many sex programs in his holosuites that serve this purpose.
-   In the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "The Naked Now", android Data reveals to a delighted Tasha Yar that he is fully functional in every way and programmed in multiple techniques — though, of course, that is a bonus, not his primary role.
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
    -   The concept is expressed as clearly as you could on prime-time TV in the 1960s in "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" when Christine Chapel meets her fiance's robot nurse, who for some reason is a lot more scantily clad than the male androids he has serving him. First she refers to Andrea as "a mechanical geisha" (in keeping with the common misconception that geishas are prostitutes), and then:
        
        **Dr. Korby:** You think I could love a machine?  
        **Christine:** Did you?
        
    -   The various androids of the Planet Mudd in "I, Mudd". Chekov is enjoying his "harem", except for the fact that they "aren't real girls". They inform him that they are, and that Harry Mudd programmed them to "function as human women". Chekov's reaction? "This place is even better than Leningrad!"
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: The protagonist of "The Lonely" is a prisoner on an asteroid, and the supply ship brings him an android female. He is far too emotional over leaving her behind for someone simply having a machine as a companion (someone who he simply talks to). His response is more or less exactly how you'd expect they'd react if their lover/wife had to be left behind. Since she apparently has fully human intelligence and emotional responses, this enters What Measure Is a Non-Human? territory.
-   _Westworld_: Maeve and Clementine are a madame and prostitute, respectively, but any of the robots in Westworld can be seduced (or raped) by guests since the park is all about entertainment and the guests can act as good or as evil as they want. Falling in love with one of the robots and then being dismayed upon discovering that it seemingly wasn't real even provides the backstory to one of the major characters.
-   _The Whitest Kids U' Know_ has a subversion: Perhaps the most inadequately designed machine of his kind, **SEX ROBOT, SEX ROBOT.** seems to actively repulse, confuse, and anger every human he comes into contact with. **SEX ROBOT, SEX ROBOT.**

    Music 

-   "Herr Drosselmeyer's Doll" by Abney Park.
-   The music video for Basement Jaxx's "Plug It In" takes place in a factory that manufactures lifelike sex dolls, with the duo themselves playing the incompetent security guards that inadvertently shorts them out.
-   Dharma -- Plastic Doll
-   "Coin Operated Boy" by the Dresden Dolls.
-   "Electric Barbarella" by Duran Duran. Especially in the video.
-   "Built for Pleasure" by Informatik.
-   Dee D. Jackson's Automatic Lover. She doesn't find the robot very appealing and sings about her desire for a human touch.
-   Marty Balin _claims_ that "Plastic, Fantastic Lover" from the Jefferson Airplane's 1967 album _Surrealistic Pillow_ was a paean to his new stereo system (or maybe TV—the story varies), but the description of it as a lover with "chrome-colored clothes", and the references to "Data Control and IBM" make it clear that he was trying to imply a little more—possibly influenced by some of bandmate Paul Kantner's SF collection.
-   Lenny Kravitz's song _Black Velveteen_ is this trope played as satire — the robot described not only guarantees you disease-free sex, it will _do the dishes_ as well.
-   24 Hours Candy Machine, by the Lodger, is about a man who made himself a sex robot. Actually a nice view of the implications a sex bot would have if they could feel and think, crossing with What Measure Is a Non-Human? as the _Twilight Zone_ entry above.
-   The music video of Muse's Mercy is centered around (apparently) one of these, who eventually rebels.
-   Gary Numan: "I hate to ask, but are friends electric? Only mine broke down, and now I've no one to love."
    -   "I had a No 1 single with a song about a robot prostitute and no one knew." — Gary Numan.
-   "Frankenstein Cha Cha" by Sigue Sigue Sputnik: "She's my silicone sensation/my secret transformation/my sex-creation built to fit the crime. (Also, their later song, "Barbarandroid".)
-   The Studio Killers' song In Tokyo: "In Tokyo, I made out with/love to a robot..."
-   Frank Zappa has a song with the title "Sy Borg" on the album _Joe's Garage_ about this trope, the "Sy Borg" shorts out after a golden shower.
    -   To a lesser extent, there's also the song "Ms. Pinky" from the album Zoot Allures. According to Zappa, its lyrics were based on a horrendous blow-up sex doll he saw in a Finnish magazine.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Eclipse Phase_ has "pleasure pods" who are partially biological and can change genders at will. It's also possible for transhumans to sleeve into one.
-   _New Horizon_: Aesir Wafan were originally built to be either this or sanitation workers. When the Wafan war rolled about, they were the ones that struck the hardest against the humans...
-   One of the plot hooks in the _Saturine Night_ sourcebook for _Promethean: The Created_ involves a scientist who hopes to render prostitution and pornography obsolete by creating one of these. Unfortunately, his attempts kept running headlong into the Uncanny Valley. But then a _qashmallim_ guided him to an unconscious young Galateid...
-   _Shadowrun_ has one of the creepier variants, "bunraku" parlors where young girls are implanted with cyberware that temporarily blanks out their consciousness and operates their bodies running any of several different personality files, depending on the client's preferences. This is actually _tamer_ than the book it's taken from, _Neuromancer_, under Literature. Interestingly averts And I Must Scream though since the girls are artificially made happy so at least they don't have to suffer...
    -   Making matters worse is said Personafix software run at unsafe levels and causes potentially eventually fatal damage. Later editions also featured more conventional variants which in addition to use as a partner, may be used as bodies by others, mainly for exactly what you expect.

    Video Games 

-   In the adult action-adventure game _Bone Town_, there are two robots one can have sex with, one really fat and one skinny.
-   _Cyberpunk 2077_ has an homage to the _Neuromancer_ example above with the Dolls. Dolls are equipped with chips that allow them to be taken over by a computer program that turn them into client's fantasy girlfriends (or boyfriends) for the duration of their session. This lack of consent results in them being very vulnerable to assault, however, which they are helpless against.
-   In _Detroit: Become Human_, detectives Connor and Anderson go to an android brothel full of sex bots to investigate a murder. Soon it becomes clear that the victim was a "client" who was murdered by sex bots who had turned deviant, and Connor has to access the memory cores of various sex bots all around the brothel to find out where the killers went.
-   _Fallout_:
    -   _Fallout: New Vegas_: Fisto. The guy who asks you to find him insists that it's not for his personal use. His obvious excitement when you return with him says otherwise. The player can try it out for themselves before bringing it back to the buyer. It does cause questions as to exactly how FISTO is _supposed_ to be able to please, considering it is a re-programmed Protectron.<small>◊</small> The screen fades to black and a variety of noises can be heard that just raise further questions. Then again, its name is "Fisto".
        
        **Fisto:** ASSUME THE POSITION.  
        **Courier:** I can't feel my legs!  
        **Fisto:** NUMBNESS WILL SUBSIDE IN FIVE MINUTES.
        
    -   _Fallout 4_ has this as well. When you reach the Institute, you will find a synth named Eve who refers to herself as a "personal synth", and can be flirted with. Considering the Institute operates under the assumption that synths aren't actually conscious beings (despite behaving as such) it's a pretty obvious application of the technology.
-   _Jazzpunk_ has a robotic hooker near the soviet consulate. You can steal a coin from a jazz musician and put in in her coin slot. She gives you a quick 2-second animation and a kiss on the cheek.
-   He wasn't designed as a Sexbot, but C8-42 from _Knights of the Old Republic_ becomes a Replacement Goldfish for his owner's late husband. Bring Canderous for this bit. He NAILS the Squick ideas this scene conjures better than Carth's and Bastila's banter.
-   One of the puzzles in _Leisure Suit Larry 7: Love for Sail!_ is how to get the top score by pleasuring a love robot.
-   _Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Don't Dry_: Larry can ask Lefty if they have sex robots in the 21st century.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_, Jack lampshades this with EDI's new appearance, complete with obvious cameltoe. Joker, in fact, asks Mordin for advice on how he could have sex with her without breaking his bones. EDI mentions in passing that the robot was based on an old friend — and possibly more — of the Illusive Man's. Shepard tries to interrupt her right there before she clarifies that there's nothing in the body's memory to suggest TIM used it that way.
-   _Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden:_ Scrap is used as currency. In the ruins of the Robo Shack shop, you can find "Pervy Parker sex bot scrap."
-   In the cyberpunk horror game _\>OBSERVER\__, one of the apartments is home to a sexbot called FemCom 6.0, which answers the door because its owner is away.
-   During your exploration of Orochi Tower in _The Secret World_, you discover that one extremely obsessive employee of Manticore Research has decided to reprogram one of the company's drones in his attempts to create his own line of sexbots. Unfortunately, the prototype was derived from a military-class drone, and worse still, the researcher failed to completely refit the newly-christened Pleasure Unit before taking it on a "test drive." You find the man's badly-decomposed body crumpled on a bed at the end of the level, with the still-active sexbot obliviously waiting for further orders.
-   Goods in _Vega Strike_ include "Pleasure Borgs" (Specialty Goods / Entertainment category). Complete with low-res photo (of mannequins); in one Loading Screen ads of "Shmrn Medical Consortium", along with medical stuff, presents these with a list of models for several species.
-   Mieu from _Phantasy Star III_, a female combat android and a party member. According to Word of God, she doubles as a "sexdroid", being able to do perform any biological functions except blinking and giving birth.

    Visual Novels 

-   Among the various specialized NPC Avatars in _Baldr Sky_ there are of course those made with sexual intercourse in mind, most of which are able to support a wide range of tastes. The main character Kou ends up being quite disgusted by some of these as they are pirated versions of an Avatar based on one of his childhood friends. It is also briefly mentioned that the advent of these led to a sharp drop in sex-related crimes, but that said there are still those that prefer the "real deal".
-   _VA-11 HALL-A_ has Dorothy, a gynoid with the body of a prepubescent girl but the mentality of an adult who works as a prostitute.

    Webcomics 

-   In _21st Century Fox_, one of the protagonists is shanghaied to a Chinese Space Station where (due to the 'one child' policies to reduce population) there are no females on board, requiring sexbots of various species to serve the male population, the protagonist being an engineer is required to help repair the damaged bots (he later rescues one of them as part of his successful escape).
-   In _Angels 2200_, Lance is a male sexbot, whom no one on the all-female ship wants to use, because, in the words of one character, "Who would want to use a communal dildo?"
-   In _Ask Dr. Eldritch_ Helen is the titular Doctor's robot housekeeper and wife.
-   The entire premise of _Chester 5000 XYV_: an inventor builds a sexbot for his insatiable wife, but then she and the robot fall in love.
-   They appear a lot in David Gonterman's comics.
-   Referenced in _Girl Genius_ with regard to one Mad Scientist. "His taste in women was... let's just say he was lucky he could build his own." Mind you, it wasn't specified whether they were robotic "clanks" or biological "constructs".
    -   In a non-canon sidestory, Agatha makes what she calls a "mechanical bedwarmer", which looks like a robot double of Gil.
-   The Robot Girl Penelope of _Just Another Webcomic_ was meant to do more but her sex programming has loaded first and most of the rest wasn't finished.
-   Averted in _Megatokyo_. Even though Ping is a prototype of the Emotional Doll System and meant to be used with Dating Sims, she is specifically a "non-H" model. Suggesting she is is her Berserk Button. However, she _is_ "actually built so I could... go that far. If I wanted to. But that part of me belongs to me. It's not part of any game." And if a user gets pushy, then that's what the built-in superpowers are for.
-   _Miscellanea_ hypothesizes that China's one-child policy will inevitably result in the engineering of sex robots.
-   In _Nine Planets Without Intelligent Life_, the development of sexbots actually results in the total abandonment of conventional relationships and the end of humanity.
-   _O, Robot!_ starts with a guy buying a robot maid for, fairly innocent purposes at first. Then his techno-fetishist girlfriend starts tinkering with her.
-   _Questionable Content_ skirts around this issue with Momo, whose original chassis has the ability to shoot live eels, is discovered making out with an “anatomically correct” action figure and engages in a fantasy with the human character Sven. Momo’s second chassis is “anatomically correct”, although this may, or may not be true - May offers to look it up online and gets tasered in return.
    -   May is certainly NOT "anatomically correct" but she DOES hook up with Sven at one point. Exactly what takes place is rather on the "flying helmet and wet celery" level, involving a range of miscellaneous Noodle Implements but May appears to be sufficiently involved or stimulated to want to "enjoy the afterglow" afterwards.
-   _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_: Sexbots appear several times, usually to screw over (huhu) the humans by deciding they'd rather have sex with each other, or flattering the male's ego so he won't notice the sexbots are of ever-lower quality...
-   A robot prostitute is a significant supporting character in the webcomic _Saturnalia._
-   ST-1X (Sticks) from _S.S.D.D._ is a rare male example, one with 25 different attachments and knows 285 different positions and "looks like he escaped a Swiss porno film".
-   Averted in _Times Like This_. Nicki, the resident Robot Buddy in the Wells household, is _not_ equipped with "anatomically accurate genitalia"...and that only the Cybernetic Libido Interactive Technology models have them.
-   ASCII of _Umlaut House_ probably wasn't designed as a sex bot (then again he was made by Rick), but one of the various jobs he had while his memory was damaged was a male prostitute. And his "father" has multiple "fully functional" prosthetic bodies, one of which was "borrowed" by Volair.

    Web Original 

-   While no sex is shown (its Tin-Can Robot nature makes one wonder how it even worked), for a while The Nostalgia Chick had a coffee-making, dish-drying Sex Slave robot that she can control with a (TV Remote) tazer. Sadly, it had the soul of a poet and a mistress who mistreated it.

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Adventure Time_ episode "The Suitor", Princess Bubblegum gives a Sex Bot in her form to a Dogged Nice Guy pick-up artist who keeps trying to date her, so that he'll leave her alone.
-   The side plot to an episode (E409 'Stan Time') of _American Dad!_ was about Roger and Steve arguing over the setup to the porno they were writing. While Roger is too old-school, all pool cleaners and pizza boys, Steve insists on the characters being androids and keeps veering the story into lore-heavy sci-fi.
-   _Archer_:
    -   Pam reveals to Malory and the important UN representative that Malory's trying to impress that Krieger created one of these.
        
        **Krieger:** I call him _\[\[Styx Fister Roboto\]. He's a fully integrated multi-fetish artificial being... and the best part is..._ he's learning''!
        
    -   Krieger has also worked on a choking robot but instead of a humanoid robot, it's simply a disembodied robot arm that is controlled by a remote. He really only made it to satisfy Cheryl's choking fetish.
    -   And then there's the holographic AI that looks like a female anime character that is so lifelike that the state of New York allowed him to legally marry it.
-   In _Batman Beyond_, such robots are banned by law. Naturally, in the episode "Terry's Friend Dates a Robot", we actually see one. It goes berserk and has to be taken down by Terry.
-   In _Bojack Horseman_, the asexual Todd, who loves Emily but realises that he can't satisfy her physically, builds a sexbot he dubs "Henry Fondle" to smooth over their relationship. It's entirely Played for Laughs, as Henry is a resolutely unsexy creation, having a non-humanoid design built from random household objects glued together, with dildos and other sex toys poking out. Emily obviously never uses him.
-   _Futurama_ had one episode featuring an educational video for middle schoolers warning humans not to date robots. All civilization is just an effort to impress the opposite sex (and sometimes the same sex), it says, and posits that dating a robot whose artificial love for you is unconditional causes you to lose any interest in doing anything else, which will cause the Earth to be destroyed by aliens. A fan theory suggests that this actually happened — the flying saucers in the video are identical to the ones we see destroying Old New York in the first episode.
-   Used in _House of Mouse_, of all places, in the MouseWorks short "Future Mania". Ludwig von Drake has Mickey, Donald, and Goofy used to test his future viewer, a machine that he claims will enable people to witness the wonders of the future and how the technology will make their lives better. Mickey attempts to contact Minnie on a monitor only to see her while she's in a towel, causing Minnie to become upset and assume that Mickey will leave her for a mousedroid. Ludwig rubs salt in Mickey's wounds by showing him a busty mouse gynoid right in front of Minnie. After all of the mishaps that Mickey and friends suffer, they hook Ludwig to the machine in an attempt to give him his just deserts, but Ludwig doesn't mind because he gets to spend time with a duck gynoid.
-   In the _Rick and Morty_ episode "Raising Gazorpazorp", Rick ends up buying Morty a sexbot they found at an alien pawn shop after much passive-aggressive whining. Morty's parents can't agree on how to feel about it. As it turns out, however, the robot is actually an alien breeding chamber that collects DNA and creates a Gazorpazorpian baby after Morty used it.
-   _Robot Chicken_:
    -   Referenced in a sketch in which a scientist is showing a highly advanced robot he created at a convention. A man in the crowd insistently asks "Can you fuck it?" When the scientist says no, the entire crowd loses interest and walks away.
    -   Arguably the Humping Robot counts, not that you'd want to get within ten feet of it.
    -   The concept from _The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ (see above) wasn't lost on the writers of _Robot Chicken,_ and they gave it the parody it deserved.
-   Referred to in _South Park_ episode "AWESOM-O" when one of the studio producers asks if Cartman (disguised as the titular robot) is also a "pleasure model".
    
    **Cartman:** _LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME!_
    
-   Six-of-Nine from _Tripping the Rift_ was designed as one, and according to her bio, she's very good at it. Something about breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record in the most efficient way possible: parallel processing in groups of ten. But, since she wanted to feel more useful to her crew, she downloaded the requisite knowledge to be the ship's science officer. (Also a subversion, as she's the only character with intelligence and decency in the cast, at least when Gina Gershon was voicing her.)
-   _The Venture Brothers_ features a character named Mike Sorayama in one episode, who has made robot versions of a girl he was obsessed with for this purpose. As the character is a reference to Hajime Sorayama, the guy who made the page illustration above, they look rather like that but with human faces.
