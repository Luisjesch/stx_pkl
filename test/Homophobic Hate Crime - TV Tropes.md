_"On Lou's lips a trace of pinot and out of them poured tales of acts of viciousness worthy of the great Lucifer himself, stories told through the night, the tortures, the beatings, the broken bones, every school has its Tigellinus, but his had more than one and each with followers, all-American boys who delighted in discovering how much pain a soul could withstand, \[...\] It gets better, Doc, fucking gets better, no one dared suggest that maybe the family and the school should change, or heaven forbid, that it was the all-Americans who should be modifying their beings, no, the homo should grin and bear it dumbly..."_

There are people who think that being LGBT+ is wrong, but not just wrong enough to avoid these people. No, they believe they must take it upon themselves to punish and harm gay people, or even try to wipe them off the face of the Earth.

A way to create drama is to take a character from your show and put them in one of these two roles: bigot or gay. Then create or define another character in the other role, and set them at each other. It almost writes itself. A typical — if somewhat outdated — story used for main characters who are styled to be homophobic is to explore how they and others respond to such hateful actions carried out. A similarly typical but much less historical story for gay characters is if they can recover from the trauma, being one in a short list of gay-tailored plots that are often the only things handed out to gay characters.

If you're looking to Bury Your Gays in a way that actually takes all the attention and fallout away from the LGBT+ character, this is a great way to instead launch into a police investigation or some tract on how homophobia in general is wrong, or how the act of violence is responded to by all the straight characters.

Fear of or recovery from this kind of incident is often a source of Gayngst. Note that it can also happen to characters who are only Mistaken for Gay.

Sub-Trope to Hate Crimes Are a Special Kind of Evil. Compare Rape and Switch, specifically the idea of "corrective rape".

See also the Heteronormative Crusader and the Armored Closet Gay. When this gets out-of-hand and becomes ingrained into society, you may be looking at people who see it as a Final Solution.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  It can overlap with Disposable Sex Worker, from the trope of queer folk and particularly trans women who are often depicted as sex workers and punished for this. Also remember, this trope only applies if bigotry was a _motivating factor_ in the commission of the crime; this does not apply to any and all violent crime against a member of a sexual minority. If the perpetrator is Equal-Opportunity Evil or Hates Everyone Equally, they probably don't count.

-   In one _Homicide: Life on the Street_ episode, Pembleton and Bayliss work the case of a man who was beaten by skinheads outside a gay bar and died soon after.

As it turns out, the victim was straight but not homophobic, and was just meeting friends near the club.
-   _L.A.'s Finest_: One case investigated, the murder of a trans woman, looks like it's possibly motivated by transphobia. This turns out to not be the case. Other trans people who the victim had known also speak of how common such hate crimes are, and some have suffered these before.

-   In _The Sopranos_, the murder of Vito Spatafore by Phil Leotardo and his men was motivated by Leotardo's homophobia and the homophobic culture of the Sicilian mafia in general.

-   After being accused of homophobia for some comparatively tame lyrics and skits on _The Slim Shady LP_, Eminem mocked the reaction in his later song "Criminal" by getting ten times worse. The song's first verse starts, "_my words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, that'll stab you in the head, whether you're \[...\]_", before delivering a Rhyming List of homophobic slurs, mocking the (likely homophobic) murder of Gianni Versace, before ironically declaring himself "a CRIMINAL!" for his lyrics. The joke is that Eminem _isn't_ a criminal because he's not actually stabbing anybody in the head, but it was lost on many, and even many of those who understood the joke found it to be in poor taste. The song led to gay rights groups picketing him on the street wherever he performed, claiming his lyrics were hateful and encouraged homophobic assaults, a panic that only settled down somewhat after Eminem got a cosign from Elton John, who insisted that the song was satirical.

-   _Rain_: Rain (a trans girl), is attacked by her older sister in her sleep, who cuts her hair so that she'll have a harder time passing. There's also Todd, a bully at school who often beat up Rudy for being openly gay (to the point of breaking one of his ribs on at least on occasion) and tried to attack Chanel for being a lesbian (and was only stopped by Maria, who got expelled while Todd suffered no punishment).
