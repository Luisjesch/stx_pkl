_"I didn't mean to call you a meatloaf, Jack!"_

_"The first, and only, time I tried to become human, I passed out, and I nearly died.  
Nothing compares to the pain I felt that day, and since then, all other pain... is numb."_

In order to shapeshift, every part of your body would have to twist and contort. Typically, it’s not acknowledged that would hurt... _a lot._ In most media, shapeshifting is done quickly and without undue pain for the shifter.

But that isn't always the case. Sometimes, those who take on another form are _really_ going to feel it.

As the name implies, a Painful Transformation tends to be agonizing. While it probably won't leave permanent (physical) injuries, it's still not very pleasant.

There are generally two ways transforming can be painful:

-   _Physical_ — The body is tortured during the transformation process. This is rather understandable, as one would imagine the bones and organs shifting around as having some sort of impact on the nerves.
-   _Mental/Spiritual_ — The user's mind is overrun with horrid... whatever. We rarely get into a shapeshifter's head. Externally, it looks like they undergo a Freak Out every time they change shape. This may even be necessary to transform, in cases like that of _The Incredible Hulk_.

Expect a lot of Anatomy Agony tropes to come into play here. I.e., the character transforming might have their teeth fall out, their fingers twitching painfully, their feet stretching out, etc.

If "painful" doesn't _begin_ to describe the transformation, see Transformation Horror.

Usually not associated with Voluntary Shapeshifting, where the user generally knows enough to pick a quick and painless method of transformation. It's much more common with Involuntary Shapeshifters and Forced Transformations. That said, it can be great drama to have a shapeshifter know a transformation will be painful but chooses to do it anyway. Done properly, it is always Worth It.
