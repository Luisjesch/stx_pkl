_"I'd buy a big prosthetic forehead  
And wear it on my real head  
Everybody wants prosthetic  
Foreheads on their real heads"_

The tendency for several sci-fi alien species to merely be one or two facial features away from humanity.

Sometimes they're not even that far away. They look totally human and sound human. In some cases, this may well be a disguise or A Form You Are Comfortable With, but in others this appears to be their natural appearance. See Human Aliens.

You'd think that alien species would be radically different — insectoids, three-legged wombats, giant cats, etc. — but animal-cruelty laws tend to discourage fitting animals with prosthetics, and the effects budget only allows for latex and makeup, so we get humans with brow ridges, humans with extra nostrils, humans with Unusual Ears, humans with bony protrusions, and so on. (Of course, the makers of _Star Wars_ found a way around this by building and operating startlingly lifelike puppets, making Humanoid Aliens and Starfish Aliens possible.) One odd consequence of this, however, is that in the Federation Council scenes in the _Star Trek_ movies, you often see very strange, non-humanoid (or only partly humanoid) aliens, because the movies have the necessary additional budget for them. These additional races are, of course, never seen in the TV series at all. Similarly, written and animated adaptations and entries tend to showcase a wider variety as well.

Gene Roddenberry gave more reasons for this in an interview once. Budget constraints aside, if you try to make aliens look completely alien, you'll firstly make them look ridiculous (cf. _Doctor Who_), and secondly make it doubly hard for the actor playing the alien to do anything mildly resembling acting. This has actually been isolated to extremely specific requirements: if an audience can't see an actor's _eyes_ or _mouth_, their ability to empathize with or emotionally invest in that character is significantly impaired. If they can see neither, it's difficult to empathize with them at all. This is one reason why mooks, especially SF mooks like the Cylons or the Imperial Stormtroopers, are so often uniformed in face-obscuring helmets. While not totally undoable with the post TOS _Star Trek_ budget, the flamboyant and outlandish alien designs of _Star Wars_ appeal to a more pulp Space Opera aesthetic from which _Star Trek_ has historically chosen to distance itself, at least onscreen; the expanded universe of comics and novels is a different beast. Additionally, Roddenberry had always insisted that _Star Trek_ was about human issues and that the aliens are intended as vehicles for social commentary. This required aliens that may have been scientifically implausible (humanoid appearance, ability to communicate in English and emote like humans, etc) but easy for the human characters to interact with and the audience to relate to in the narrative. _Trek_ fans may assume that the pure hard science fiction adventures and alien encounters occur offscreen (indeed, the animated shows tend to have even less humanoid aliens).

The anime equivalent is the alien with Pointy Ears, colorful facial markings, chromatic skin tones (sometimes hair too, if humans are restricted to normal colors), or cutesy animal-like traits.

A scientific explanation of this trope is the theory that most advanced alien species will look roughly similar to humans due to the theory that our physical layout is the most efficient one for an oxygen-breathing carbon-based life form.

The next step past Rubber Forehead Aliens (catlike or buglike or lizardlike aliens that can still sit in chairs and hold weapons) is Humanoid Aliens, possibly overlapping with Intelligent Gerbils. Contrast with Starfish Aliens. The Unintentional Uncanny Valley can result if your RF Alien looks a little _too_ human. Possible sister trope to Bizarre Alien Limbs, if the make-up crew opts for weird rubber hands instead of facial appliances. A definite sister is Palette-Swapped Alien Food, where alien food looks like oddly-colored human food.

On a side note, Bill Blair holds the Guinness World Record for the most Rubber Forehead Aliens (202). His first science fiction makeup role was in _Alien Nation_ and he never stopped. For starters, not only has he played in various _Star Trek_ franchises as Cardassians, Jem'Hadar, Klingons, Borg and Vulcans (yes, all plural), but he has appeared in nearly every _Babylon 5_ episode as well as both movies. His credit on the show? "Alien Actor".

-   In UK advertising, the Tefal Eggheads.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Outlaw Star_: The C'tarl-C'tarl, are essentially Cat Girls (and boys of course) from space. _Were_\-Catgirls, as we later found out.
-   _UFO Robo Grendizer_: The Vegans and other alien races have strangely-shaped heads or unusual skin or hair colours at the very least. Gandal has blue skin and his head looks cubic due to his very angular features, his wide forehead, and that the top of his head is nearly flat. Blackie has dark-purple skin, pointy ears and a very pointy, hairless head. Even the most human-looking aliens -like Rubina- have bluish or abnormally pale skin, black irises or green or aquamarine hair (keep in mind no human character in this anime is blue-haired).
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ does this with many inhabitants of the magic world; they look like normal people, but with horns or weird shaped ears or something. The rest are Beast Men.
-   The Saiyans in _Dragon Ball Z_ are just humans with tails in appearance; that turn into giant monkeys during a full moon. _Dragon Ball Z_ is _very_ bad about this. There's even a whole race of "humans but skin is different color"; the Brench-seijin, which Jeice and Salza belong to. Most of the major races fall into this. Most prominent besides the Saiyans are the Namekians, who are green-skinned and fanged with antenna and long pointy ears, but otherwise resemble human men, and the Shinjin, who look like humans with long pointy ears and weird skin colors (e.g. red, green, purple). In-universe, Earthlings and aliens are all classified as "humans" (sometimes localized as "mortals"), which shows that they aren't really all that different from each other.
-   Practically all aliens in _Leijiverse_. Mazone, Illumidas, Tokarga... they're all humans with slightly different skin colour, even the Mazone who are plants. Miime's race is unrevealed, but she's also fully humanoid apart from not having visible mouth in most? story versions.
-   _Cat Planet Cuties_ features Little Bit Beastly aliens like the Catians (cats) and Dogisians (dogs). Hilariously, the Catians originally called their home planet Earth and referred to themselves as Earthlings — they changed the name of their planet and species to Catia out of courtesy. A race of bunny girls is also briefly mentioned.
-   _Macross_ has many examples, with the most notable being the Zentraedi; once you got past the whole size difference thing, they're nearly identical to humans, with the exception of skin and hair tones of varying offness to human norms. Later entries also tended to give pointy ears to Zentraedi (and humans with Zentraedi ancestry). This similarity is because both species' evolutions were heavily influenced by the Protoculture.
    -   The Zolans in _Macross 7_ are another Protoculture-influenced species who appear mostly similar to humans, except for very Pointy Ears, two-toned brightly-colored hair, and prominent fur on the forearms of the men. They are also implied to be marsupials, like most of the lifeforms on their homeworld.
    -   The Ragnans of _Macross Delta_ basically look like dark-skinned humans who happen to have gills, webbing, and fins. There's also the Windermerians, who are physically indistinguishable from humans outside of having at least one antenna-like tentacle growing out of their hair, and the Voldorians, who are basically Little Bit Beastly Cat Folk. Like humanity, Zentraedi, and the Zolans, the natives of Ragna, Windermere, and Voldor are "children of the Protoculture".
-   One of the main characters in _Ulysses 31_ is Yumi, a young Zatrian girl. The Zatrians are a humanoid race with pale blue skin, orange eyes, light blond hair and pointed ears.
-   _Digimon_ actually has this in the form of Agunimon, whose appearance is justified by him being the Human Spirit of Flame. He looks mostly human, except that he has '80s Hair, fangs, and red markings on his face. Oh, and his boots are designed to accommodate claws.
-   _Dairugger XV_: The aliens of Galveston are basically humans with blue skin and red eyes. Keats and Kirigas, the two Rugger team members from planet Mira, are a different shade of blue and have pointy ears. Kreuz, the only team member from planet Sala, is yet another shade of blue with a tiny circle on his forehead.

    Comic Books 

-   Harry Vanderspeigle, the protagonist of _Resident Alien_. He has a similar physique to a human but has characteristics like purple skin and pointed ears to set him apart.
-   Lampshaded in some _Space Agent Valérian_ book. There are quite a few non-human aliens but also a multitude of practically humans, to the point where it's mentioned that "one head, two hands, two feet, two eyes, could be anyone".
-   The Kree, from _Marvel Universe_, are extraterrestrials with two main races: the blue-skinned (such as Ronan the Accuser), and others who seem completely human (such as Mar-Vell and Marvel Boy). There's a little problem: the blue Krees are dominant in the Kree social hierarchy, and treat the others as worthless slaves. With such a background, Ronan's original opinion of us humans is nobody's surprise. He eventually got better, up to and including marrying the human-looking Inhuman princess Crystal and defending her and her kind against other blue Kree who called them 'pink-skinned lab apes', and later becoming an ally to the Guardians of the Galaxy, but the social attitude still persists in other Kree.
-   _Superman_:
    -   The Qwardians, like Kaliber from _Superboy and the Ravers_ and the Green Lantern foes the Weaponers of Qward, look like large pink hairless people wearing odd contacts.
    -   The Graxians from the _Supergirl_ story arc _Red Daughter of Krypton_ are blue-skinned humanoids with flat noses and cow-like ears.
    -   _Supergirl (1982)_: In issue #21, Superman and Supergirl come upon the Seeders, basically humanoid but with pink skin, blue-hair and vaguely-feline features.
    -   The Warzoon from _War World_ are red-skinned, fanged humanoid aliens.
    -   In _Crucible_, Lys Amata's unnamed alien species are pink-skinned, blue-haired humanoids with long oblong faces and black eyeballs. On the another hand, Tsavo is a Ngoan, and they look like humanoid, long-tailed, thick-furred cats.
    -   The Vrangs from _The Krypton Chronicles_ and other stories are hairy humanoids with brownish-grey skin, pointed teeth, huge lower fangs and large lobed ears.
    -   _Last Daughter of Krypton_: Reign, who belongs to an unnamed alien species, is grey-skinned, her eyes' sclera is pitch-black, she lacks eyebrows, and her flat and wide nose resembles a monkey's.
    -   In _Superman vs. Shazam!_, Karmang is a Martian whose skin is chalk-white and hairless.
    -   In _Way of the World_, Krallian aliens look right like blue-skinned, blank-eyed humans.
    -   "Superman vs. Muhammad Ali": The warlike Scrubbs are green-skinned, big-foreheaded aliens; otherwise they look right like humans.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: The Geni just look like human men with green skin and mustaches.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: The Kreel, who are the ruling people of the Sangtee Empire, look like humans wearing red contacts, purple paint, fake pointy ears with incised helixes and some prosthetic makeup bits covering up their hair and giving them barbels and flattish hair substitutes.
-   _Lobo_: The Czarnians (Lobo's species) were (or just barely _are_, since Lobo is the last one) basically human except for red eyes, pale gray skin, and _huge_ '80s Hair (usually black).
-   While _The Worlds of Aldebaran_ features a huge variety of alien species, the only sapient aliens encountered so far look very much like humans, except that they are entirely hairless and have a flat nose reminiscent of a cat's muzzle (an impression reinforced by their yellow eyes and slit pupils). They do have a semi-aquatic life cycle, much like the Mantrisses, who come from the same planet.
-   As in the source material, namely the Barsoom books, Martian civilizations in _Warlord of Mars_ are indistinguishable from humans except for their unusual skin tone and laying eggs instead of giving birth. The First-Born are grey skinned, the Okarans have golden-skin and the Red Martians are reddish-copper toned. The Therns are the closest to Human Aliens and the Green Martians are on way another level.
-   The Psycogs and the Ethereals in _Khaal: The Chronicles of a Galactic Emperor_. The former are human beings with different colors and exotic head protrusions while the latter have three fingers and long tails.
-   _Copperhead_ is home to a ridiculously diverse alien population. Some are distinguishable only by nonhuman skin color (Thaddeus) or unusual ears (Nestor and Zolo).
-   _Hawkman_: Thanagarians look exactly like humans save for their giant wings.
-   Tamaraneans such as Starfire of _Teen Titans_ fame, are indistinguishable from humans, save the solid green eyes and gold/orange colored skin, yet are specifically stated to taxonomically be _felines_ rather than apes. Anyway, Tamaranians look enough like humans that for a time, Starfire had a successful career as a fashion model.
-   The Yargonians in _Tragg and the Sky Gods_ look mostly human but with golden skin, green hair, pointed ears and slanted eyes.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Dick Tracy_: Not an alien, but The Brow certainly had an unusual forehead.
-   _Dan Dare_: The Atlantines are human but with blue skin and a visible lump on the forehead. A nice subversion later reveals that they are descendants of people kidnapped from Earth aeons ago, and their differences from Earth people are adaptations that evolved to enable them to survive on Venus.

    Fan Works 

-   Lampshaded slightly in _A Changed World_, based on _Star Trek Online_. Dr. Warragul Wirrpanda, USS _Bajor_'s chief medical officer and a human, tells a time-shifted Bajoran that "the only significant difference between you and a female of my species is some uterine quirks. Now, Bolians, those are a real challenge."

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _This Island Earth_'s Metalunians were similar to humans except for huge foreheads and white hair.
-   In _Galaxy Quest_, the character of Dr. Lazarus from the Show Within the Show is played by Alexander Dane (who is in turn played by Alan Rickman) wearing a rubber forehead. The Thermians think he is a real alien, even though his rubber forehead begins to show damage and develop holes over the course of the adventure. The Thermians themselves are a subversion of this: on first appearance, they look like short-ish humans who have Vulcans for hair stylists, but it's later revealed that this is just A Form You Are Comfortable With.
-   The movie _Trail Of The Screaming Forehead_ takes this to the logical extreme. The aliens _are_ foreheads that attach themselves to humans. The movie is pure, high quality B grade.
-   _The Fifth Element_ has a variety of particularly tacky examples. The alien opera-singer sort of looked like a hybrid between an Asari, a Twi'lek and a Xenomorph. Mangalore warriors from the same movie appear to be this but were actually the products of CGI and animatronic costumes.
-   _Battlefield Earth_ featured the Psychlos, whose main distinguishing features were that they were big, had eyebrows that joined their hair, high foreheads, and dreadlocks.
-   _Prince of Space_: the men of Krankor are rubber _nose_ aliens. This might have been slightly more badass had the noses not had a silhouette much like a chicken beak.
-   _Star Wars_ generally tries to avoid relying on this trope by including a number of Beast Man, Starfish Aliens and Humanoid Aliens that require full body costumes, puppetry, animatronics and later Serkis Folk to do. However, there are quite a few species that look almost human; the most famous example is probably the head-tentacled Twi'leks.
-   _Guardians of the Galaxy_ has multiple examples among its main cast, to say nothing of _hundreds_ of extras:
    -   Gamora, a Green-Skinned Space Babe with a few little markings on her face and no eyebrows, who otherwise looks human.
    -   Drax, a large grey-skinned (but not a Grey) humanoid alien covered in red tattoos.
    -   Ronan the Accuser, a blue-skinned Kree (see the comic book section above), albeit a sicklier, more greyish blue than his comic book counterpart, and with purple eyes and unevenly-shaped irises.
    -   Nebula, Gamora's adoptive sister, an originally purple-skinned, bald alien woman, now a Cyborg with extensive areas of blue grafted synthetic skin.
    -   Carina, the Collector's pink-skinned Krylorian (in this universe, essentially a _literally_ pink Kree) assistant.
    -   The Collector himself might qualify, seeing as he has a handful of facial markings that could be natural or could be tattoos or makeup.
    -   Mantis in _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ looks like a human woman with two antennas sticking out of her forehead, an odd skin tone, and large black eyes. The Sovereign race looks like tall humans with gold skin, hair, and eyes.
    -   Most of the background races in the _Guardians_ films qualify as well, usually having an inhuman skin tone and/or one or two prosthetics (e.g. forehead ridges, horns, pointy ears, some combination thereof) as their sole distinguishing features from humans and Human Aliens, though there are a few Humanoid Aliens scattered about, most notably Groot.
-   The _Men in Black_ films have a mix of this and Starfish Aliens. The former is significantly more prominent in _Men in Black 3_, in the 1969 MIB headquarters, which is a deliberate nod to The '60s' sci-fi films.
-   In _Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn_, the Nomads have skin growing over their right eye sockets.

    Literature 

-   Tie-in books based on _Star Wars_ have a _lot_ of humanoid aliens. The most human-like aliens are called near-human, and are considered to have descended from humans
    -   The blue-skinned, red-eyed but otherwise human Chiss are typical.
    -   _New Jedi Order_: The Yuuzhan Vong look like big, muscle-y humans with a few deliberate errors- their skin tones are varying shades of grey rather than brown, they have talons instead of fingernails, their foreheads are prominent and sloped, their eye-sockets droop like a basset hound's, and their hair is almost always black when they're not bald (which is more common among them than it is among humans). Artists also commonly depict them with pointed ears, though this is never described in the novels. Since they treat ritualized Body Horror as a mark of high status, the higher-ranked a Vong is, the less humanoid they usually look (for example, having "skull-faces" due to slicing off large sections of their noses).
    -   The Noghri (Darth Vader's, Grand Admiral Thrawn's, and eventually Princess Leia's personal bodyguards) look basically like short, bald humans - but they also have claws, fangs, gray skin, large black eyes, and bony ridges on their skulls.
    -   The Yevetha could pass for emaciated humans if not for their armor-plated skin, pure black eyes, gigantic claws, and six fingers on each hand.
-   The Psychlos in L. Ron Hubbard's original _Battlefield Earth_ novel are vaguely-described, but come across as big, hairy humans, save for inexplicable "eyebones" and "mouthbones" instead of eyelids or lips.
-   Discussed by Sarah in _InCryptid_, who calls them "_Star Trek_ aliens". The inhabitants of the dimension in _Calculated Risks_ look humanoid except for Pointy Ears, rosette Facial Markings, and slightly-larger eyes in yellow and green.
-   E.E. "Doc" Smith's Space Opera _The Lensman Series_ had human, humanoid and utterly alien species. It also had a guiding sentient race that was controlling evolution on many different planets.
-   Justified in the early science fiction novels, _Last and First Men_. The varieties of human aliens are a result of original humanity escaping from a dying Earth. For two billion years, humanity evolves through nine different stages and splits off into a smaller set of subgroups.
-   The axxa from S.F. Said's _Phoenix_ have horns, hooves, and glowing eyes, but otherwise look human. It turns out that the horns are a hairstyle and the hooves are boots, but the glowing eyes are genuine.
-   _Wicked Lovely_ tends to go this route with a lot of The Fair Folk. Niall, for example, is described as having "too-sheer skin, like parchment by a flame, and too many joints."
-   The aliens in _Deathscent_ by Robin Jarvis are somewhere between this and Humanoid Aliens. While both races look quite like humans - enough that when one first arrives the human characters don't realise what he is until they see him in the light - their biology is very different. One of them perceives the world primarily through sense of smell, has four nostrils (one of which is in the forehead) and speaks a musical Starfish Language.
-   A large number of the Culture's alien species are near human. It was explained away as a convergent evolution thing. In fact, most of the books take place before humanity as we know it achieves spaceflight. Most of the Culture's citizens are Human Aliens and no distinction is made between them and us.
-   C. J. Cherryh's series _Foreigner (1994)_ deals with the deceptively humanoid alien race known as the Atevi. While they look similar to us, they think very different than Humans.
-   Many of the land-dwelling races in the _Books of the Raksura_ are human-looking, but with a trait such as fur, horns, oddly colored skin, or the like.
-   Subverted in David Brin's _Uplift Storm Trilogy_ novel _Brightness Reef_. The Rothen, a human-like alien race trying to con human beings, wear artificial foreheads and other facial prosthetics to make themselves appear more human-like. The Tymbrimi are genuine Rubber Forehead Aliens, mostly-human looking though with different proportions and facial features, granted they're minor shapeshifters who can gradually change their features over time. All the other aliens in the series are Intelligent Gerbils or Starfish Aliens.
-   In Robert A. Heinlein's _The Star Beast_, the Rargyllian Dr. Ftaeml is described as a Medusiod Alien, being a humanoid with tentacles on his head resembling snakes. There is also passing mention of exchange students from Procyon VII who are "cephalopods".
-   Older Than Feudalism: The very first "science fiction" novel, _True History_ by the Ancient Roman author Lucian, has rubber forehead aliens living on the Moon... and the Sun and several stars. A Moon-person looks basically human but has one toe on each foot, a marsupial pouch in his belly, a leaf growing out of his butt, and leaves for ears. They do have a lot of Bizarre Alien Biology (removable eyes and genitals, hermaphroditic/all-male reproduction, the ability to grow people on trees, etc.)
-   The Catteni from Anne McCaffrey's _Catteni_ quartet would be Human Aliens except for their grey skin. This is made fairly explicit when several human characters successfully disguise themselves as Catteni with face paint.
-   In Walter Tevis' original novel _The Man Who Fell to Earth_, Thomas Newton is described as having albino-white, curly hair, fair, hairless skin, pale blue eyes, thin and long fingers, and an "elfin"-looking face with wide, "boyish"-looking eyes; only four toes on each feet, no appendix and no wisdom teeth, and a more well-built respiratory system that makes it "impossible \[for him\] to develop hiccups".
-   In _Wasp (1957)_ by Eric Frank Russell, the Sirians are similar to humans, their most striking feature being their purple skin, a "bow-legged gait", and a number of other minor differences. This helps Mowry (a human) in passing as a Sirian without suspicions.
-   Zaphod Beeblebrox in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Trilogy_ could be considered one. He looks perfectly human except for his extra head. In the movie, the head is implied to be artificial just like his third arm, but all versions of Zaphod's (and Ford's?) species seem to require more than two sexual partners to reproduce: "He shares three of the same mothers as me." Not to mention that such an arrangement could result in one black kid and one white kid, meaning skin tone must work more like hair color does for humans.
-   _Xandri Corelel_ averts this for every species except the Anmerilli, who look almost exactly like humans except for their cheek ridges, bulbous foreheads, longer ears, and tails. Xandri describes the similarity between the two species as "one of Mother Universe's cosmic jokes."
-   _The Occupation Saga_:
    -   Shil'vati have skin in the purple to pink range and average seven feet tall in females and a little under six in males, but otherwise look wholly human aside from having small tusks on their lower jaws (giving them a resemblance to orcs).
    -   Halkam look like grey-skinned humans with snake-like scales.
    -   Jason compares the Nighkru to glow-in-the-dark drow: they're black-skinned Space Elves with patterns of bioluminescent microbe colonies in their skin and eyes.
-   _Crest of the Stars_: The Abh are distinguished by their blue hair, though some of them also have pointy ears. This one _does_ get justified, though, in that the Abh are in fact _genetically altered humans_, who even call their stellar nation the "Humankind Empire Abh" (or a variant, depending on how you translate it); the Abh see themselves as humans with a few different traits, while their (non-modded) enemies tend to see them as vile aliens, wholly different from humanity. One of the narrative thrusts of the work is examining just how human they really are — or aren't.
-   Invoked in _The Red Vixen Adventures_ when Salli is watching a foxen kaiju movie and wonders aloud, "Who are those humans in the silver jumpsuits with the prosthetic foreheads?"

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Alien Nation_. They're bald and their foreheads look like Mikhail Gorbachev's turned Up to Eleven.
-   _Aliens in the Family_: Cookie looks mostly human, but she has blue ridges on the sides of her head.
-   _Babylon 5_ is almost a case study on alien race-types on television. The Shadows and Vorlons were Starfish Aliens. Then, the League of Non-Aligned Worlds, the minor powers of the region, were a mix of this and Humanoid Aliens. The Minbari were Rubber-Back-of-the-Head Aliens, being bald humans with a bony crest covering the back of their skulls (which they apparently actually carved into the elaborate shapes we see much as humans cut hair), and the Narn were fairly elaborate Rubber Forehead Reptilians. The Centauri were a bit of an odd bird, since they were superficially Human Aliens (which was actually a part of their backstory, Centauri explorers/con artists almost convinced humanity we were a lost Centauri colony, until someone got hold of a Centauri DNA sample and figured out we have more genes in common with octopi), and their Bizarre Alien Biology was rarely shown outright<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , but was frequently referenced and became a plot point fairly frequently.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ and _Angel_ have a lot of demonic races that are essentially humans in various different colors of facepaint. However, this is justified because almost all demons that appear are possessing or have interbred or been contaminated by humans. The few Pure Demons that have appeared didn't look remotely human:
    
    The Mayor's final form, a giant insectoid serpent.  
    The demon below the Hellgate, a mass of tentacles with a never seen "true face".  
    Illyria, a metal-clad, taloned mass of tentacles.
    
-   The Martians in _El Chapulín Colorado_ are normally actors (most commonly Rubén Aguirre who was very tall in real life (1,90 meters or around 6,23 feet) with a bold cap and heavy make-up.
-   Most of the demons on _Charmed_ looked like humans decked out in heavy makeup, ear extensions and snaggle-teeth.

-   Multiple Votan species in _Defiance_ look a lot like humans.
    -   Irathients have bright red hair, red and white skin patterns, and a slightly more prominent forehead.
    -   Castithans have very pale skin and white hair.
    -   Indogenes have no hair and white (actual white) skin covered with hexagon patterns, justified as they are cyborgs.
    -   Bio-men on the other hand are hulking, blue-skinned, and bald, but are actually human Super Soldiers.
    -   Omec have purple skins with patterns, silver irises, and large canines.
-   A few (not many) alien species in _Doctor Who_ fit in this category.
    -   Thals are no different from humans other than bleach-blonde hair (with makeup-like facial markings in the non-canon Cushing movies). The Kaleds, encountered later, are all black-haired humanoids, until the species became Daleks, anyway.
    -   In "The Space Museum" (a rare monster-free story) Moroks have exaggerated hairlines, while Xerons have a second set of eyebrows and shadowed eyelids.
    -   The Drahvin in "Galaxy 4", who look like blond women except with dark spotted patterns in place of eyebrows.
    -   The Inter Minoran bureaucrats in "Carnival of Monsters" have grey skin and bald pates. (One slips off in the ending scene, if you're looking for it.) The Lurmans have orange-toned skin.
    -   Peladonians in "The Curse of Peladon" and "The Monster of Peladon" have naturally multi-toned hair — strawberry blond and white for aristos, kinky brown with blond stripes for the working class. The hairlines are lowered and join to the eyebrows over the temples for some characters.
    -   Referred to in "Midnight", in which two characters discuss meeting an alien with a large forehead.
    -   Argolins from "The Leisure Hive" have yellow-green skin and strange hair and pods in their hair.
    -   According to _The Writer's Tale_, the aliens that were to become the Vinvocci were called the "Prostheticons" in the rough draft.
    -   The Kahler from "A Town Called Mercy" look human save for Facial Markings on one side of their forehead. The Doctor exploits this: knowing that the cyborg-assassin Anti-Villain is trying to avoid unnecessary civilian casualties, he paints the birthmark of his intended victim onto the faces of several humans and forces him to disable his auto-targeting software.
    -   The Expanded Universe has offered an explanation; Rassilon, the founder of Time Lord society, was a bit of a racist and deliberately tinkered with evolution so that races resembling his own would be more likely to evolve. While it's uncertain if this is considered canon, the show has addressed that humans and Time Lords look almost identical.
        
        **Amy:** You look human.  
        **The Doctor:** No, you look Time Lord. We were here first.
        
    -   "The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos": The only feature that distinguishes the Ux from humans are spiral-shaped, raised Facial Markings on their cheeks.
-   In spite of its subversions of this trope, _Farscape_ has a few species of these floating around, albeit usually more a case of body painted and Anime Hair wig aliens than rubber-forehead.
    -   Nebari look human except for their monotone grey skin and the fact that their hair colour depends entirely on their gender.
        -   Subverted wonderfully in the 19th episode of season one, in which Chiana, a Nebari, dons utterly unconvincing magnolia-coloured pancake makeup and a black wig (which might count as cross-dressing for a Nebari woman). She does this in an attempt to pass for Sebacean, where Sebaceans look exactly like humans, but does nothing about her enormous aniridic pupils or grey lips. For some reason, it works for a while.
    -   Delvians look like blue, scaly humans. The series' main Delvian is bald, but others have hair. All that said, they're actually a race of humanoid plants.
    -   Kalish have intense blue-green eyes, copper-red hair and a few transparent scales on their temples.
    -   Interions are almost completely humanoid except for their ridged foreheads and higher hairlines. They're a close enough genetic match to humans that members of the two species can serve as medical donors for each other.
    -   The Luxans have a fairly elaborate tentacle-featuring face prosthetic, but still count as an example of this trope.
    -   Most Sebaceans look exactly like humans (justified, since they are Transplanted Humans with some genetic engineering thrown in), but we see several with skin and eye colors not seen on Earth which would qualify if the whole race shared them. There are also several individuals and cultures whose race is ambiguous; they may be ethnicities or they may not. One episode had a race that the Sebaceans claim is a lost colony of a Sebacean subspecies, although the locals deny any biological connection.
-   The early 1970s Roddenberry production _Genesis II_ had post-humans with _two navels_ as their "distinguishing characteristic". That was mostly a "screw you" towards the censors. For some reason, up until then navels were considered taboo.
-   A recurring sketch on _Human Giant_ is an actor who plays one of these on a show called Battle Sector 17. Fed up with having to spend the time to apply the make-up he gets surgery to make it permanent... just before the show is canceled. He then spends several episodes trying to get work but no one will take him because of the make-up, not even for his old Battle Sector 17 character. When he finally gets a job he has to spend hours to get make-up to make him look human, it doesn't quite work.

-   Except for Yaphit, (a sentient blob), most aliens we've seen so far in _The Orville_ are rubber-forehead ones; this includes the ridge-headed Moclans, and the Xelayans who have Pointy Ears and some marks on their noses and over the eyebrows. (In order to let Lt. Kitan to be an Alien Space Babe).
-   In the season finale of _Other Space_, an alien reveals that its insectoid appearance is actually a mask and that its true form is this.
-   The Zatarians in _Pandora_ have some ridges along their forehead and around their eye sockets, but otherwise are fairly human-looking.
-   Used in _Power Rangers_ on those rare occasions when aliens aren't either people in full-body rubber suits or regular actors using a silly name. Aquitians, for example, have a purple... thing on their head (external braincase?), and Xybrians have green hair and a gem embedded in their forehead.
    -   Super Sentai is known for being far less elaborate with theirs - _Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger_ has the Ryujin, who merely have four tiny claws over their cheekbones. _Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger_ in particular spammed the use of full-head rubber masks (over very mundane clothing too), unlike _Power Rangers S.P.D._ which relied a lot on prosthetics. A full nonhuman body typically indicates the Monster of the Week. Except, of course, for the Muppet Catfolk.
    -   _Dekaranger_ also has aliens use human disguises a la _Men in Black_, presumably to save budget.
    -   Zayto from _Power Rangers Dino Fury_ is from the planet Rafkon and has a pair of antenna on his forehead.
-   The Coneheads from _Saturday Night Live_ were conceived as a parody of the '50s B-movie Rubber Forehead Alien.
-   Parodied by Bill Bailey in _Space Cadets_. Interlock fingers of both hands. Place palms on foreheads. Voila! Instant Klingon.
-   _Space Precinct_ loves it some actors with rubber heads on. The sheer contrast between big rubber head and undisguised human body gives the whole thing a farcical charm.
-   Most "aliens" in the _Stargate-verse_ are just humans, transported from Earth in antiquity. But of those that don't, some — particularly other species used as hosts by the Goa'uld — still fit this Trope.
    -   The Unas are humans with scales, chin spikes, and only four fingers, which puts them more in the Humanoid Alien category.
    -   Wraith from _Stargate Atlantis_ fit well enough though, once you get past their (justified) Bizarre Alien Biology. Inverted by a Wraith in "Vegas": he uses cosmetics to turn himself into a Rubber-Forehead _Human_, which goes completely unnoticed.
-   _Star Trek_: Klingons, Vulcans, Bajorans, Ferengi, and Cardassians, just to name a few. The majority of all races encountered in every Star Trek series share the same basic outline of a human, with many differing from human solely by slight variations in their forehead, ears or bridge of the nose. The exceptions are usually Monster of the Week types. Some specific acknowledgements of the trope throughout the various television series include:
    -   The _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "The Chase" provides a tidy explanation (part retcon, part Lampshade Hanging) for the prevalence of these in the _Star Trek_ universe. All the main races in the universe (humans included) were created from "seeds" placed in their respective worlds' primordial oceans by an even more ancient humanoid race.
    -   Lampshaded when the Bajoran Ro Laren, who has something of a chip on her shoulder, refers to herself as "the token bumpy-head" in one of the novels. Behind the scenes, Bajoran makeup was specifically designed to be minimal so that the actress who played Ro would remain attractive. (This turned out to be a blessing when _DS9_ rolled around and required lots and lots of Bajoran extras. The makeup people grew very skilled at getting them quickly and efficiently "nosed," as they put it.)
        -   The same thing happened when the appearance of the Trill was retconned from their first appearance in _TNG_. When the makeup was applied to Terry Farrell as she prepared to play Jadzia Dax on _DS9_, even the minimal Bumpy Forehead they made for her was thought to obscure her beautiful features too much, so they toned it down still further to the leopard spots that became the appearance of all subsequent Trills. (The _DS9_ novels eventually reconcile this and other differences with _TNG_ by saying that they simply represent ethnic variations within the Trill humanoid species.)
    -   Another Lampshade Hanging occurs in _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "Chimera" in this conversation between two changelings, Odo and Laas (who usually _appear_ as Rubber Forehead Aliens, even though they're actually liquids):
        
        **Laas**: And humanoids are not very tolerant of difference.
        
        **Odo**: Some of them are. There are dozens of species on this station. They tolerate each other's differences very well.
        
        **Laas**: He has bumps on his forehead. She has a wrinkled nose. But they're basically alike. They're bipeds that eat, sleep, breathe. You and I are nothing like them.
        
-   _Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms_: It's fantasy rather than science-fiction, but most of the Ghost Tribe look like ordinary humans with horns growing from their faces.
-   The television series of the novel trilogy _The Tripods_ averts this, just as the books do. The Masters were tripedal creatures that differed a bit from their book description, but it was still one of the first times a television series did not employ this trope.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_:
    -   One interpretation of "The Eye of the Beholder". It's revealed at the end that the doctors' snoutlike noses and enlarged upper lips are the norm, while the seemingly beautiful patient is considered hideously deformed. She may be a Human Alien in a Rubber Forehead race.
    -   There are some hilarious rubber-foreheaded aliens in "Mr. Dingle, the Strong" which feature one race as two guys stuck together with metal antennas on their heads and another race as children with painted mustaches partially inflated balloons on their head and two bug-like antennas. Thankfully, the episode was meant to be a comedy.
    -   The episode titled "Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?". The setting of this episode is a rural restaurant. During the 25-minute episode, we wonder which one among a group of people is the alien. It turns out, we were seeing the alien all along, and that there were two of them. One alien has an extra arm (this one is from Mars). The other one has a third eye (he's from Venus).
    -   The infamous "To Serve Man" features tall aliens with larger brains.
-   Kind of a given on the make up effects reality show _Face/Off_. Though there are a few challenges where they are forced to come up with more unique designs, like the Alien Zoo challenge and the Green Screen Alien challenge.

    Pinball 

-   Featured among the various aliens in _Big Bang Bar_.
-   The alien leaders in _Firepower_ are orange-skinned humanoids with oversized wrinkled foreheads.
-   Averted in _Asteroid Annie and the Aliens_ — none of the aliens look close to human, and the closest ones are clearly Humanoid Aliens.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The in-universe setting book _Xenology_ references this. While the Eldar, the Tau, and (to a lesser extent) the Orks look outwardly humanoid, inside the races are nothing alike. The tech-priest doing the dissections is extremely confused by this, especially since his other subjects aren't remotely humanoid. What the tech-priest doesn't know that players and fans do is that many species were created by the Great Old Ones.
    -   Speaking of which, the Eldar straddle the line between this and Humanoid Aliens. They are thin, graceful, pointy-eared (Elf expies In Space!), but their body structure is much more lithe and spindly.
    -   Orkoids:
        -   Orks look like, well, Orcs. They're humanoid, but green and have small eyes, exaggerated lantern jaws, large numbers of long, thick teeth with a pair of prominent tusks for their lower canines. The thing that starts to test the limits of this trope is the size of them, as Orks get bigger the older and more battle-hardened they become; the average Ork boy is the size of a large human athlete, but warbosses become inhumanly huge. There are even recorded, very rare instances of Orks who become the size of small buildings.
        -   Grots and Snotlings, the Orks' smaller, goblinoid brethren are somewhat different. Grots could pass for this trope, since they are about the size of a child, being about 1 meter or so tall. Snotlings are visually similar, but even smaller.
        -   Squigs avert this trope entirely, as they are animals. Even if you wanted to wrap this trope around the animal kingdom, most squigs don't really have a good analog, since most are egg-shaped critters that are basically rudimentary biological and locomotive systems wrapped around an enormous, fang-lined maw. Some squigs become more analogous to actual creatures, like sharks or mammoths.
    -   Tau are much better fit to this trope, as they are humanoid, but are distinctive enough. They have hooves for feet, hands with four fingers apiece, have skin tones that vary between blue to grey, have solid red eyes, and have a single slit in their head for a nose. Certain castes have differing builds, but the only real outlier are the Ethereal caste, who have a bony protrusion on their forehead, and it's speculated to be related to why the other castes are so fanatically and blindly loyal to them (as the Tau are mentioned to have been uplifted by some Eldar in old fluff, though it is unclear if this is still canon). Oh, and despite what the countless pieces of fanart would tell you, female Tau aren't very attractive by human standards.
-   _Space Munchkin the RPG_ parodies this trope with the "Bumpy Headed Alien" racial choice. You choose, among other things, your facial bumps, the concept your entire species is devoted to, and the one aspect of human culture your species doesn't understand ("we do not have a word for this thing you call 'hygiene'")
-   _Teenagers from Outer Space_ divides aliens into one of three types: Near Humans (which tend to be either this trope or Human Aliens), Not Very Near Humans, and Real Weirdies.
-   In _Pathfinder_, elves are Ancient Astronauts from Castrovel who got to Golarion through long range portals. They still look basically like humans with pointy ears.

    Video Games 

-   The Split race in the _X-Universe_ games are tall human-like aliens with very rough looking narrow faces, and odd colored skin.
-   _Adiboo: Magical Playland_: Adiboo is an alien who looks like a normal human aside from the Pointy Ears and yellow-ish skin.
-   The dominant race in the _Jak and Daxter_ series are humans with excessively long pointy ears.
-   Subverted in _Phantasy Star_ with Newmans/Numans, and later Beasts in _Phantasy Star Universe_. Sure, they look human enough, save for their ears and (in the case of Beasts) their harelips and eyes ... but they aren't actually aliens at all. They're actually genetically engineered _humans._ Played straight, though: The three planets' humanoid species are Parmanian/Palmanian (humans), Motavian (furred, beaked humanoids), and Dezolisian/Dezorisian (Rubber Forehead Aliens with green skin).
-   In _Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon_, the people of Ultra Megalopolis are extradimensional humans with blue skin, who Hau outright refer to as aliens.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   Asari fit the trope perfectly, being blue-skinned alien space babes. Although their tentacles are actually on the _back_ of their heads, where a human would have hair<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . While they wear the same armor as humans in-game, _every_ race sees them as their equivalent of blue-skinned alien space babes except possibly the Krogan, who still see them as attractive.
    -   In _Mass Effect 3_, if a male Shepard romanced Tali and saved the quarian fleet, Tali will leave a photo of herself without mask or helmet on his nightstand. It turns out that were it not for the skin markings, purple-tinted skin, the three-digited hands and feet, and the avian legs, she could pass for human. It helps that her "photo" is literally a photoshopped stock image of a model<small>◊</small>
    -   The batarians are the closest _Mass Effect_ species to this trope, as unlike the asari (who are all female) or the quarians (who, as mentioned, have three digits on each hand and foot and digitgrade legs), batarians have the same sexual dimorphism as humans, human-passing skin tones (various shades of brown), and are identical to humans from the neck down, to the point that the only way to tell batarian and human enemies apart when they're wearing face-concealing helmets is that the batarians' grunts have a filter applied to them. They differ from humans only in that they have four eyes, needle-like teeth, and ridges along the fronts of their faces. They'd definitely look at home in the _Star Trek_ franchise.
    -   On the technical side, the developers of _Mass Effect_ admit that when it comes to fighting their alien designs were limited to bipeds with human proportions because of the Unreal engine's combat system. That's the reason you never see any of the more alien races such as the elcor or hanar in-combat; each race would require whole new skeleton rigs of their own.
    -   _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ has a bit of fun with this trope, since the angara are humanoid(ish), but with vastly different physical builds, for the reason given just above. An asari scientist is disappointed by the physical similarities, and at least some angara are weirded out by humans (these are the nicer responses), with one e-mail found at one point of an angara wondering if the human explorers modified their appearance to look less alien to them.
-   In _Star Ocean_ series, if a major species of aliens are not Human Aliens, they will be this. The only truly strange aliens are either Always Chaotic Evil, or one-off weirdos, like inventors in _Till the End of Time_.
    -   _Fantastic Space Odyssey/The First Departure_:
        -   Fellpools allegedly descend from cats, and for some reason possess tails and pointy ears. They also have copper-based blood, which, somehow doesn't prevent them from interbreeding with Earthlings. There are also their subspecies - Highlanders and Lesser Fellpools. The former have striped skin in addition to tails and pointy ears, while the latter are full-blown Cat Girls.
        -   Featherfolk are Winged Humanoids, who can use Symbology without Power Tattoos.
    -   Tetrageniots from _TheSecond Story/The Second Evolution_ have a Third Eye that gives them better depth perception.
    -   And then there are three different species of Space Elves - Nedians from _The Second Story_ and Eldarians and Morphus from _The Last Hope_. They have pointy ears, and that's about it. The latter game, however, raises the possibility that Morphus _are_ Nedians, or at least their offshoot group.
-   Miriam in _Shining Force Feather_ might be a living Lampshade Hanging. She meets our protagonists and is immediately amazed, as she hasn't ever seen a human before. Never mind that Miriam is an elf, and that the only difference between her and Jin are her pointy ears, slanted eyes, and skinnier build. One scene later, she meets Alfin and is equally wowed, as she's never seen a Core Unit before, despite that Core Units are... Ridiculously Human Robots. Meanwhile, she meets all the varieties of Beast Men with no more than chipper enthusiasm.
-   Stellar Santiago in _Space Quest VI: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier_ (though this trope is otherwise mostly absent from the _Space Quest_ series).
-   Most barbari races of _Taming Dreams_ fit the description. Bold have a furry nose and a cleft upper lip and the Meek have doe ears and antlers on the males.
-   Gandrayda from _Metroid Prime 3: Corruption_ is one of these; While she's one of the more humanoid characters among the cast, she has translucent pinkish-purple skin that reveals an odd skeletal structure and weird tentacle-like hair
-   In _The Sims_ franchise:
    -   In _The Sims 2_ and _The Sims 3_, alien sims are just like human sims, except for the green skin and the completely black eyes.
    -   In _The Sims 4_, alien sims remains not so physically different from human sims, except that they now have different sets of inhuman skintones (like blue and purple) and eyes.
-   On the initial release, _Stellaris_ deliberately averted this; aside from humanity, the selection was a mixture of roughly Humanoid Aliens and truly bizarre forms. Eventually, by popular demand, an entire (relatively small) category for humans and very human-like aliens (include Space Elves and Klingon look-alikes) was added. The "Humanoids Species Pack" then added a few more, most of them being based on typical fantasy races, such as orcs, dwarves or cyclopses.
-   Astaroth from _Marco & the Galaxy Dragon_ is an alien who looks like a bald, extremely muscular man with chalk-white skin and black sclera, and he has snake-like appendages growing from the base of his skull. This is in contrast to his daughter Haqua, who is a straight-up Human Alien.

    Webcomics 

-   _Ayuri_: Dobeks, which are domesticated humanoids with the intelligence (and fashion sense) of a dog.

-   _Freefall_: Subverted: Sam Starfall _looks_ humanoid, but it's really a suit to let him operate in an Earth-like environment. We don't get to see his true appearance, but it involves tentacles, and humans apparently find it disgusting.
-   _Homestuck_: The trolls make reference to a _lot_ of Bizarre Alien Biology endemic to their species, like "chitinous windholes", "auricular sponge clots", "porous cranial plates", and various colors of blood, but outwardly just look like grey-skinned humans with yellow-orange eyes, horns, and fangs. Complicating this is the fact that some of the Bizarre Alien Biology seems actually more likely to be bizarre alien _terminology_, instead, or a very idiosyncratic translation convention if you presume they're not speaking English in the first place.
-   _Terra_: All the known nonhuman species fall here. The Azatoth would be Human Aliens but for a heavier brow ridge and a couple nodules on the sides of their noses; they also tend to be a foot taller than the average human. The Vareliens look like asari with longer, more flexible head-tentacles. The Shintari have swept-back conical heads and orange skin.
-   _Zukahnaut_'s protagonist is a palette-swap and a new pair of ears away from looking like a passable (if ugly) human.
-   _Leaving the Cradle_: Utterly averted, despite being Space Opera. None of the species of the galaxy resemble anything human except for, well, humans.
-   _Grrl Power_: Justified. In addition to some aliens that _are_ humans with some minor modifications (enough humans have been abducted that they have a stable population in space, and they have access to genemods), Dabbler explains that the humanoid form is evolutionary advantageous in most areas. Two arms, two legs, and two eyes are an improvement over anything with fewer arms/legs/eyes, but adding more produces diminishing returns for increased calorie requirements. There definitely are really strange alien races out there, but a very noticeable percentage of sapient species are humanoid.
-   _Outsider_: Both largely averted and deconstructed.
    -   Loroi look just like humans, except for the pointy ears, blue skin tones, odd eye and hair colors, and their males being smaller than and far outnumbered by the females. This similarity is noted as a significant abnormality by everyone, considering that the rest of the races go from notably physiologically different to being Starfish Aliens. The fact that humans also seem to be resistant to the Loroi's telepathy implies that this may be far more than mere coincidence, but when Tempo makes a fairly loaded implication implying Jardin of being a physically-tailord spy, Jardin testily counters that it would be extremely stupid for the Umiak to create a mole that sticks out like a sore thumb as much as he does.
    -   An interesting detail revealed in the Insider posts is that there's another species, the Nibiren, that is to the Barsam — a species that, along with the Loroi, is part of a group of biochemically related organisms related to a powerful Precursor civilization — what the humans are to the Loroi, i.e. different in coloration and a few physical details but otherwise startlingly similar. Rubber Forehead Aliens to another alien species, essentially. The conclusion reached by the Barsam is that they were genetically engineered with the Nibiren as a model. If this is true, it might have interesting implications for the relationship between the humans and Loroi.

    Web Originals 

-   The "Alienoids" of the _Garnet and Gure_ short, Holiday Quickie-Toon resemble cheesy black-and-white style spacemen with over-long eyebrows.
-   In the _Homestar Runner_ episode "buried", Strong Bad unearths what he believes to be an alien artifact. He states that the earth was colonized by extraterrestrials, and that it explains "why all beings look the same except for slight differences of our foreheads!"
-   Due to non-professional special effects and costumes, Noah Antwiler (from _The Spoony Experiment_) portraying Terl from _Battlefield Earth_ in some episodes of Channel Awesome's review shows and the fourth year anniversary _To Boldly Flee_ looks much more human than the version portrayed by John Travolta. It also means most "rubberhead" effects could not be recreated. However, it's still clearly a Psychlo.
-   _Earthling Cinema_ series of fictional reviews is hosted by alien Garax Wormuloid, who is just the creator with eyebrows significantly wider than his head.

    Western Animation 

-   A number of the extraterrestrial characters in _Defenders of the Earth_ fit this trope:
    -   The show's Big Bad, Ming the Merciless, has green skin and pointed ears, traits shared by his children, Kro-Tan and Castra. In the original "Flash Gordon" comic strips, Ming resembles an oriental warlord, but he was given a more obviously alien appearance in the Defendersverse to avoid any Unfortunate Implications.
    -   Princess Astra from "The Revenge of Astra" has pointed ears, but otherwise looks human.
    -   The Psychic Warriors from "The Evil of Doctor Dark" are humanoids with '80s Hair and antennae which they use to focus their powers above their eyes. Mara, the youngest of the trio, who defects to join forces with the Defenders, also appears in the sequel, where her skin (blue in the original episode) has a more human tone, though she retains her characteristic hair and antennae.
    -   The title character in "The Starboy" is a humanoid child who appears to be a little younger than Kshin. He is hairless with white skin and the star which gives him his name on his forehead; this star changes from red to blue based on his mood.
-   The majority of alien species _Futurama_ are more or less humanoid, including all the main cast. That being said, the show does have a wide array of odd aliens (sentient nebulae, sludge monsters, swarms of flies, etc) and robots who are either minor recurring characters or the focus of individual episodes. Subverted with Leela, who is revealed in an early season to be a remarkably minimally mutated human mutant who was raised to think she was a Last of Her Kind alien.
-   Warhok and Warmonga, the Proud Warrior Race aliens who appear in season four of _Kim Possible_ are an animated version of this. They're nine feet tall and have green skin, but otherwise identical to humans.
-   _The Owl House_:
    -   Witches look human save for their elf-like Pointy Ears, and an extra organ attached to their hearts that allows them to cast magic (though that's not visible from the outside). Witches also have a greater variation in hair and eye color than humans do (Amity has yellow eyes, and Raine's hair is naturally teal). Some witches also sport explicitly more non-humanoid features, like Boscha's three eyes, Adrian Graye's tail, and Amber's bat-like nose and ears, likely due to cross-breeding with the much more animalistic demon-population.
    -   Grimwalkers are made to look exactly like witches. While they are made of completely different stuff and are likely more _tree_ than witch, the only external feature that distinguishes a Grimwalker from a witch is the fact that Grimwalkers always have bright pink eyes.
-   The Bortronians from _Ready Jet Go!_ resemble humans, but are all very stretchy, have thin faces, and wear space-suits.
-   The Gems in _Steven Universe_ generally look like human women except for their skin tones, hair colors, hairstyle, and having a gemstone embedded somewhere in their bodies. That said, their figures are often drawn more exaggerated than humans, and the series increasingly shows types of gems that are still humanoid but with blatantly inhuman features (Nephrite is a Cyclops whose gem functions as an eye; Sapphires, Aquamarines, and Rutiles are The Noseless; many types are inhumanly large or small), and that's before getting into gem fusions which are generally larger than any human, frequently possess Extra Eyes and limbs, and sometimes are only partially humanoid. Technically, their gemstones is their Heart Drive and _actual_ form, while their bodies are a Hard Light projection, so they can actually shape-shift at will as a result, meaning their normal shapes are preferred forms than anything else.
-   Starlee from _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward_. Her race look almost exactly like humans, except for having blue skin and pointy ears.
-   Starfire of the Teen Titans (and the rest of her race) has orange skin and Bizarre Alien Biology (including superpowers), but looks entirely human otherwise.
-   The Alteans in _Voltron: Legendary Defender_ look almost exactly like humans, but have a few differences, such as the small marks of color next to their eyes. However, the other alien species tend to look more...alien.
-   On _Young Justice,_ Rannians are depicted this way, with pale yellow skin, pointed ears and, at least in Alanna's case, purple eyes. This is a change from the comic books, where they're Human Aliens.
