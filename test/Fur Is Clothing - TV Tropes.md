Always a good idea to keep extra fur around...

**Stewie**: Brian, quick, grab some money.  
**Brian**: (Picks up a handful of cash and stuffs it in his sides)  
**Stewie**: Y-you have pockets? Are you putting that in pockets? That's so cute.

In animation, sometimes a Funny Animal who doesn't wear any clothing will, as gag, treat the fur that covers their bodies as a removable suit. This can be revealed in a few ways: perhaps a Non Fatal Explosion goes off, leaving our character in Ash Face and furless, with only Goofy Print Underwear on. Or, the character can remove their fur voluntarily by using a zipper that was never there before. It's almost always Played for Laughs. This can also provide a loophole around Non-Humans Lack Attributes, hence the character will usually react in embarrassment after their fur has been removed. This also almost always tends to be non-canon, as the characters who remove their fur will also have been shown bathing or showering without having to do this. Of course, there are some exceptions.

There is a variant of this trope in which an animal character has pockets as part of their actual physiology. Those pockets are most commonly located on the thighs. Another variant involves animal lifting the fur or skin on his or her leg to reveal a sexy woman's leg. Another variant takes on the form of a Fur Bikini with the actual fur looking like a bikini on the character.

Each variant can also work with feathers, or, more rarely, scales and skin. Not to be confused with Pretty in Mink or Fur and Loathing, though any of those might be referenced for the sake of humor.

Compare Removable Shell for the shelled animal variant, Removable Animal Markings for when an animal's natural stripes and spots are depicted as removable, and Clothing Appendage for when the "garments" aren't removable.

## Examples of Removable Fur:

    open/close all folders 

     Anime and Manga 

-   _Digimon Adventure_ has a more serious example. Gabumon take his coat off to keep an unconscious Matt warm. When Matt wakes up Gabumon quickly grabs his coat and puts it back on. Followed by Matt saying "I didn't know you could do that." Justified, in that Gabumon is actually a reptile, wearing fur from his evolved form, Garurumon.

    Asian Animation 

-   In the first episode of _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_, Weslie uses a fan to blow the disguise off of Wolffy. The air from the fan blows off the fur on Wolffy's body as if it were an article of clothing, complete with heart-print underwear being revealed underneath.

     Comic Books 

-   _The Intertidal Zone_: One panel shows a crab molting its shell in a bathroom, feeling embarrassed that the reader is watching it molt.
-   One gag in _Léonard le Génie_ had the cat stripped naked after the disciple catches him. He angrily asks for his "clothes" back and puts his fur back on before resuming the chase.
-   In _The Unfunnies_, Pussywhisker has the fur covering his lower half pulled down like pants (and exposing his rather tiny penis) when he prepares for the operation to remove his testicles after being convinced he has testicular cancer.

     Comic Strips 

-   _Garfield_
    -   The February 12, 1981 strip had Garfield rip his "cat suit" when he tried to pick up a chocolate covered peanut. He then said he needed a bigger one.
    -   The August 10, 1985 strip had Garfield take off his fur like a suit before stepping onto a scale.
    -   In the September 20, 1987 strip, Odie pulls on a thread that causes the fur on Garfield's lower half to fall down like pants. Jon laughs at Garfield's misfortune and Garfield retaliates by removing Jon's belt, making Jon's pants fall down.
    -   The title panel of the August 1, 1993 strip shows Garfield's fur put on a clothes hanger as if it were a suit.
    -   The title panel of the November 7, 2004 strip shows the door to Garfield's dressing room opening to show Garfield powdering his face and wearing a corset, boxer shorts and socks while his fur is hanging behind him on a clothes hanger.
-   _The Far Side_: one strip has a snake and a man meet in a pond while skinny dipping. The man has a pile of clothes on the lakeside, and the snake has his skin on the bank.
-   In a _Krazy Kat_ strip, Krazy claims to be "complitley clothed in a garmint of fur"—as opposed to Ignatz Mouse, who's hairless and therefore "nude". (Krazy feels embarrassed for him and covers him with a cloth.)
-   _U.S. Acres_:
-   This<small>◊</small> Charles Addams cartoon depicts a bear leaving a fur storage building wearing only boxer shorts, the implication being that he dropped off his fur coat there.

     Film- Animated 

-   This also happens to Lady Kluck from Walt Disney's _Robin Hood (1973)_, as a result of her being grabbed by the rear while charging at some rhino guards; thus exposing some pale purple and pale lilac polka dot printed bloomers, which shows that her feathers are her clothes.
-   _The Swan Princess_ demonstrates this with Puffin, who rolls up the feathers on his wing as if they were a sleeve when he recovers from Odette removing the arrow that was stuck in it, then later is shown covering himself in embarrassment when all his feathers fall out during the "No Fear" musical number.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation_:
    -   Early in the movie, Dizzy Devil is afraid to spin (like the Tasmanian Devil) because he's shedding, and doesn't want to end up naked. Eventually he does spin and lose his fur, and spends the rest of the movie wearing a cardboard box and feeling ashamed for being naked.
    -   Later in the movie, Elmyra visits the ACME Wild Safari Zoo, where she sneaks out of her parents' car and grabs a cheetah by his tail. The cheetah tries to run away from her, but loses his fur in the process. Elmyra wears his fur, and in a later scene, the furless cheetah is wearing a censor bar over his groin.
-   Happens near the beginning of _Winnie the Pooh (2011)_ during the scene where Pooh is exercising in front of his mirror. When Pooh bends down, a seam on his rear end (he's a _stuffed_ bear) rips open, causing some stuffing (which is probably the stuffed animal equivalent of internal organs) to fall out. He eventually realizes this, and as a result, Pooh immediately sews his rear end back together again.

     Live-Action TV 

-   In _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_, Salem is a realistic (except for the talking) cat that can't take his fur off, but when an magical accident vanishes it away, he yelps in horror, "I'm naked!" This perception is probably left over from his previous life as a human, when he did wear actual clothes.

     Puppet Shows 

-   In the _Toby Terrier and His Video Pals_ episode "Time for A Party", Bob dresses up as "Bark Kent" by wearing nothing but a pair of glasses. Then he attempts to turn into "WonderChow" by removing his fur to reveal... that he forgot to put his costume on.

     Video Games 

-   In _Conker's Bad Fur Day_, Conker is a pantsless Half-Dressed Cartoon Animal, but in the parts of the game where he urinates there is an audible zip before and after he does so.
    -   In the Xbox remake _Conker: Live and Reloaded_, he's wearing shorts, so it makes more sense.
-   In _Pink Panther's Passport to Peril_, Pink Panther once takes off his pink fur like a suit so he can put on more fashionable clothes in order to visit a British mansion. His fur-suit is then stolen by 2 bad guys.
-   Some Pokémon actually wear "clothing."
    -   This is actually a bit more sticky; some Pokémon are specifically stated as wearing clothing (such as the belts that Sawk and Throh make themselves out of vines), but others, while _looking_ like they wear clothing, are more ambiguous on whether or not they _are_ clothing. One of the more famous examples of this is the debate over whether the "pants" Lucario wears are part of its fur or not. Machoke was largely considered to wear belts but Word of God confirms that they're nude.
    -   Also, what is a Gardevoir or a Gothitelle's "dress" supposed to be made from?
-   This trope is taken to its gory extreme in the PETA-made game _Super Tanooki Skin 2D_, which consists of a skinless tanooki chasing Mario around trying to get his fur back. It's as horrifying as it sounds.

     Web Original 

-   Baysa from _Minecraft For Noobs_ takes of his fur before bed in part 11, although he still retains his white color. he also gets a hole in his "pants" in part 16.
-   Originally, some of the colors from _Neopets_ (such as Royal) would make one of the Pets wear clothing once they've been painted that color. However, when all of the Pets were redesigned in a way so they can be dressed in "actual" clothing, these colors may actually now count.

     Webcomics 

-   Played with in a _Nedroid_ comic; Reginald mocks Beartato for not dressing in layers like he did, then gets so involved in the rigamarole of taking off said layers that he barely notices when he's run out of clothes and starts taking off his skin.
-   In _Sabrina Online_, Sabrina is apparently wearing pants that make her look like she's not wearing any pants, because it blends into her fur.

     Western Animation 

-   _The Adventures of Dawdle the Donkey_: Rola The Polar Bear sometimes reaches into the fur on his sides and pulls things out, like they're pockets.
-   _Almost Naked Animals_ takes this to its literal extreme. The entire cast has mostly-bare skin and underwear, even characters who are animals that logically can't be shaved.
-   In _The Angry Beavers_ episode "Sans-a-Pelt," a mishap involving a magic trick left Norb and Dag with no fur except head fur...and needing to get back to the dam. They encounter some sheared sheep who perform a musical number convincing the brothers (mainly Norb) of the benefits of going naked.

-   The Classic Disney Short _Working For Peanuts_ ended with Chip 'n Dale disguising themselves as albino chipmunks by covering their bodies with flour to hide from Donald Duck while at a zoo, but their disguises are ruined when the two both accidentally fall into water, washing off the flour on their lower bodies. The two chipmunks then make up for this by rubbing away some of the flour on their upper bodies to make them look like if they were wearing suspenders, therefore grabbing the tourists' attentions. When the zoo finally closes for the day, Dale celebrates by pulling on his "suspenders", leaving Chip dumbfounded.
    -   The 1929 Mickey Mouse short "Karnival Kid" features Mickey removing his ears and the top part of his skull as if it were a hat and bowing to Minnie. Later when Minnie pays for one of Mickey's hot dogs, she pulls back the fur on her leg to grab a coin, and Mickey sneaks a peek, blushing.
    -   In the _Mickey Mouse (2013)_ shorts, Minnie is in her classic, topless design with the skirt. There are a few jokes that her fur is a shirt, or else Nude-Colored Clothes.
-   In _Courage the Cowardly Dog_, Courage sometimes wears briefs underneath his fur.
-   A weird version involving robots occurs in the _Cyberchase_ episode "A Day At The Spa" where Buzz and Delete get stuck to a magnetic device and when they come off their "pants" rip exposing underwear underneath.

    -   In the _Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid_ short "Congo Jazz", Bosko at one point pulls down a monkey's fur in order to spank his bare bottom. The monkey's much larger father then comes along and starts rolling up the fur on his arm like a sleeve to prepare for beating up Bosko in retribution for spanking his kid.
    -   In "All Fowled Up" when Foghorn Leghorn accidentally blows himself up with a firecracker, the feathers on the top half of his body get blown off and he holds up the bottom half like they're pants without a belt. The 'pants' slip a bit and we see his underwear: lavender with yellow polkadots.
        
        "Fortunately, I keep my feathers numbered for just such an emergency."
        
    -   A similar gag happens at the end of the Leghorn short "Weasel Stop", when he and the weasel are run through a machine that removes their feathers/fur and bales it up like hay.
    -   In Tex Avery's "Cross Country Detours", was a parody of a nature documentary, which at one point features a lizard shedding its skin. The lizard gets on its hind legs and begins to perform a striptease dance while it sheds its skin, a scene rotoscoped from footage of an actual stripper they brought into the animation studio.

    -   In "A Date for Dinner", the cat is shown to wear a union suit under his fur.
    -   In "Lazy Little Beaver", the wolf is knocked out of his fur and overalls and left in a union suit.
-   In _Oggy and the Cockroaches_, not only does this apply to the mammalian characters, but also to the cockroaches as well. Oggy switches between having undergarments on underneath and none at all depending on the episode. The characters' coats behave like fur in some instances (for example, when Oggy's or Jack's hair gets blown away entirely by a very loud noise), but like fabric in others (for example, when a part of the coat gets ripped off, or when a character pulls up their "shirt", puts their hand in their "pocket", or washes their full body "fur suit").
-   Perry the Platypus from _Phineas and Ferb_ is frequently like this. In one episode, Perry went to his lair via suction tubes and reveals Perry naked with his boxers.
-   As revealed in the PixarShort _Tokyo Mater_, a car's paint actually serves as its clothing, so not wearing paint at all is considered to be the automobile equivalent of nudity.

-   In _The Real Ghostbusters_, the gag of an animal's fur being their clothes comes up in the _Slimer!_ short "Cruisin' for a Bruisin'", where Slimer has to sneak Mrs. Van Huego's dog Ferdinand aka Fred out of the Sedgewick Hotel to the Ghostbusters' barbecue while dealing with a guard dog named Bruiser. At one point, Bruiser barks at Fred loudly enough that Fred's fur comes off to reveal boxer shorts.
-   The titular duo of _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ have revealed their fur to be nothing but a suit in a few different episodes, by unzipping to take a bath or go skinny dipping.

    -   In _One Ham's Family_, where the Big Bad Wolf, disguised as Santa Claus, is put through the wringer by a "bad widdle kid" pig. At the end, the kid giving his mom a fur coat, she gushes "It's just what I've always wanted," only for the Wolf, pink and naked from the neck down with a towel around his waist, takes it back and says "You and me both, sister!"
    -   In _Ventriloquist Cat_, a cat is projecting his meow at a series of mannequins dressed in police uniforms. Butch the dog strips the uniform off each dummy looking for the cat. The cat then projects his meow onto a real police officer, and Butch ends up stripping him down to his boxers. In retaliation, the officer pulls Butch's fur down, leaving him in his boxers.
-   In _Timon & Pumbaa_, the eponymous characters show that their fur is this (they sometimes wear underwear under it). This pretty much changes what many people thought about the _Lion King_ franchise, because based on this info, we can pretty safely assume that it goes for the whole movie cast.
-   _Tom and Jerry_ has done this on a few occasions, with Tom either being shaven or being scared out of his fur, wearing nothing but Goofy Print Underwear. It happened particularly often in the later Chuck Jones shorts.
    -   In the short "Quiet Please!", Spike the bulldog rolls up his arm fur like a sleeve, revealing an anchor tattoo, before running after Tom to pummel him.
    -   Spike also takes the fur of his upper body off like a shirt and places it over a puddle for Tom and Jerry to walk across in "The Truce Hurts". He wears a red undershirt beneath his fur.
    -   In "Love That Pup", Spike warns Tom that if he messes with his son Tyke one more time, he'll skin Tom alive. Cue Jerry framing Tom for messing with Spike's son once again. In the final scene we see Spike, Tyke and Jerry sleeping on Tom's fur, while elsewhere Tom spies on them wearing nothing but a wooden barrel with red long johns underneath.
    -   When Tom runs over Mama Duck with a lawnmower in "Little Quacker", exposing her turquoise bra and bloomers, which she quickly covers with her now robe-like feathers.

-   _T.U.F.F. Puppy_:
    -   "Mom-A-Geddon" has Dudley's mom follow him to T.U.F.F. headquarters, which she reveals is because she put a tracking device in his underwear. This is then proven when the ordinarily pantsless Dudley has the back of the fur on his lower body pulled back to reveal his undies.
    -   An odd case happens in the episode "Hot Dog", where Kitty Katswell cools herself down by taking off all her clothes and shaving her fur into a onesie.
-   _What A Cartoon! Show_ featured this in the short "Shake & Flick: Raw Deal in Rome", where one scene has the fur covering the lower half of Shake's body falling down like pants to reveal boxer shorts.
-   Yakkity Yak's fur coat is depicted as a literal fur coat that can be taken off.
-   In the series _Zig & Sharko_, various animals seem to be able to painlessly remove parts of their body, with zippers sometimes appearing to make the appendages seem even more like clothing accessories. Zig appears to wear boxer shorts underneath his fur, while Sharko apparently wears the same beneath his grey shark exterior.

     Other 

-   Wigs may technically count as Real Life example. Even the idea of putting your own natural fur back on can be Truth in Television if you make a wig out of your own cut hair, like Karen Gillan did after shaving her head to play Nebula in _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_.
-   One M&M's commercial has the green M&M piece changing clothes (her candy shell) and being caught naked (she is a chocolate chunk).
    -   Another commercial has the brown M&M clearing up a misunderstanding by explaining to some humans at a party that her shell is brown, so it only looks like she's naked. The red M&M sees her, think's it's "that kind of party" and tears off his own shell.
-   In the novel _American Gods_, Shadow hitches a ride with a fellow who tells a tall tale about a deer that literally jumped out of its skin to escape a hunter, then was given a replacement knitted by local women.
-   The entire story of How The Rhino Got Its Skin is about this — the reason the rhinoceros' skin is all wrinkly is because some other animals filled it with sand when he took it off to go swimming.
-   This trope goes way back. Many mythical "animal brides" like selkies and swan-maidens shed their hides or feathers to reveal a gorgeous woman underneath. Unscrupulous human men often force these women into marriage by stealing and hiding the animal skins to keep their brides from returning to the wild.

## Fur Pockets Variant Examples:

-   Bugs Bunny from _Looney Tunes_ was often portrayed with "pockets" on his furry thighs, that he'd keep his hands in or pull carrots out of.
    -   An interesting version appears in "Rabbit Hood" when Bugs pulls a paper and pen out of the side of his chest as if he was wearing a coat.
-   In an episode of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, Spike the dragon is suddenly given a pocket in his scales, which he pulls a gemstone out of.
    -   As with the dragons from _Dragon Tales_, though they are referred to as "pouches."
-   In _Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood_ Daniel Tiger, the main character, is seen naked numerous times throughout the series, usually when he’s taking a bath or getting changed into new clothes. We see a lot of this in the episode Good Morning Daniel/Goodnight Daniel!
-   In "Back to the Pilot", Stewie notices Brian has body pockets on his thighs and thinks it's "so cute". Brian himself has since confirmed, however, that his fur isn't his clothing.
-   In _The Great Mouse Detective_ Fidget the bat is briefly shown to have a pocket on the inside of his wing as he's searching for the checklist that he lost.
-   Malloy from _Brickleberry_ has body pockets on his thighs.
-   Marsupials can be a Real Life example of this, though in fiction they are often unrealistically shown carrying a wide variety of anything in their pockets.
    -   See Kangaroo Pouch Ride.
-   Despite the quote at the top of the page, Brian from _Family Guy_ is a complete subversion of this trope; the aforementioned "pockets" incident seems to be a one-off joke, seeing as in a recent episode, he confirms, "I _am_ nude, I'm just covered in fur."
-   Merfolk in the _Emily Windsnap_ series have pockets in their fish tails.
-   _Homestar Runner_: In "Drive-Thru", The Cheat exposes his fur pockets, showing off that he doesn't have any invisible money.

## Fur Used to Show Some Leg:

-   At one point, Slappy from _Animaniacs_ is shown lifting her leg fur, doing a sexy leg reveal. Walter Wolf does this once as well, with the same results.
    
    **Slappy**: What can I say, I'm watching my figure. Somebody has to. \*lifts her fur to show some leg\*
    
-   _The Pink Panther_: Played with in an episode of _The Pink Panther Show_; Pink Shows Some Leg (and a stripy sock) while hitch-hiking ... and then seems to remember that fur _isn't_ clothing and howls in pain clutching his leg.
-   Woody Woodpecker does this in one picture while in drag. The leg "she" shows Wally Walrus is shaven, shapely and gorgeous. The other, which he shows us, is scabby, hairy, and gross.
-   The aforementioned Mickey Mouse short "Karnival Kid" has Minnie doing this.
-   In the Droopy short _Sheep Wrecked_, the Wolf tries to catch a sheep by firing a plunger-tipped arrow onto her and pulling her back with a rope. He ends up tearing off the sheep's puffy wool, underneath which she turns out to boast _quite_ the curvaceous, feminine figure, complete with shapely bare legs
    
    **Wolf**: Now, there's a purty leg of lamb.
