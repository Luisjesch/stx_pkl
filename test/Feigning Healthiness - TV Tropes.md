Most would agree that being sick sucks, but it has one great benefit: being able to snuggle into bed for a long catnap. But what's that? You have a huge deadline coming up and the clock is ticking? That really cute celeb you adore is in town? You have a doctor's appointment but you're Afraid of Doctors and/or needles? People want you to take Foul Medicine? Why, this is no time to be lying in bed! It's time to start Feigning Healthiness.

Feigning Healthiness is when a character is sick but pretends to be well. This means covering up any iota of a symptom through any means necessary. Make-up, blaming other things, sometimes Blatant Lies; anything to hide that cold. This can also apply to injuries, which may mean a character has to hide limping.

This typically occurs during a Sick Episode (including Plague Episodes and Chickenpox Episodes). Often times, this ends with the sick person being exposed (sometimes right after they insist they are fine) and An Aesop about taking care of yourself when you're sick and/or honesty.

Can often be a form of Obviously Not Fine.

Compare Working Through the Cold, Definitely Just a Cold, and I Can Still Fight! which remove the "pretending" part of the act (the character admits to being somewhat ill, but not badly enough that they need to stop and rest). If the character is hiding a disability rather than a temporary illness/injury, then they are Hiding the Handicap. If the illness in question is terminal, see Secretly Dying. Contrast Playing Sick (where a well character pretends to be sick to get out of doing something), Prank Injuries (where a well character pretends to be injured), and Wounded Gazelle Gambit (where someone pretends to be ill/injured to manipulate others).

Truth in Television for workers without sick days and employees who cannot afford to take days off, who pretend to be healthy so they don't miss a shift. As well, people in high-pressure industries or sectors (law firm, software developer, pop star) may face intense pressure to feign healthiness and come to work, even if they feel sick.

-   _Wonder Woman: Black and Gold_: When Cathy Perkins reunites with Diana she's dying of cancer, but acting like she's fine. She was at the time using magic to give herself more time, but this did not heal her and merely slowed the spread of the disease.

    Comic Strips 

-   _FoxTrot_: Jason attempts to fake being well in order to go to school and at the very least take a math test despite clearly being sick. The teacher doesn't buy it and tells him to go home.

-   In Rainbow Dash's chapter of the _Triptych Continuum_ story _Sick Little Ponies (and One Dragon)_, Rainbow wakes up sick with Manière's, which causes three days of vertigo and movement (slow) is only possible if the patient is focused and not operating on instinct. At first she is in denial until she sees the pink tinge to her eyes. The problem? She got sick the day of the Wonderbolts Academy practical exam entrance trials. The next trials are in _fourteen moons_, during which any number of potentially deadly missions can happen. Desperate, she seeks last-minute cures from Fluttershy, Twilight, and Zecora, who can't and won't help Rainbow for her own safety's sake, though Zecora gives her a potion to mask the eye problem. Rainbow goes through her trial routine anyway by sticking to basics, and somehow manages a move nopony's seen in a LONG time while trying to impress the judges, one of which already knows how good she normally is (Spitfire). Spitfire calls her out on her behavior and has her take a blood test to prove she wasn't using field-boosting drugs before and got a bad batch this time. When the results come back negative, Spitfire says she'll be back in four days when Rainbow's better for a redo. We don't get to see the redo, but Rainbow gets her acceptance letter at the end.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Gattaca_: Since the protagonist has a heart condition that precludes him from being an astronaut, he takes on a healthy man's identity to pretend to be well. This is most apparent when he is subjected to a treadmill stress test; he takes measures to fool the monitoring equipment and pass the test, but collapses in agony as soon as he is out of view of the testers.
-   _Schindler's List_: During the annual health inspection, the prisoners of the Plaszow concentration camp are separated into healthy workers and sick workers, with the latter inevitably destined for "special treatment".

    Literature

Years later, they meet again, with Heather proudly recalling the time she proved no sickness would prevent her from meeting her idol, which quickly gets her murdered by Marina. This was possibly based on a similar incident that happened in real life to Gene Tierney (though without the murder).

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_: In "The Road Trip", Rosa, the resident badass, gets a bad cold but refuses to admit it because of her stubbornness and because she has a perp to process.

Meanwhile, Spock's father Sarek (one of the diplomats) needs a blood transfusion, with Spock as the only viable donor. However, as the quantity needed would also put him out of action for several days, Spock's sense of duty won't allow him to relinquish command whilst the ship is still in danger. To avoid him being responsible for his father's death, Kirk fakes an early recovery to retake command.

Anton promptly hides his hand, with Diego's help. Towards the end of the game, as Anton's Sanity Slippage increases, he stops bothering to hide the effects of his leukemia from Dani.
-   One of the great mysteries in _Batman: Arkham City_ is how the Joker, who injected himself with Titan at the end of the previous game and subsequently developed toxic blood poisoning, is able to appear healthy throughout Batman's encounters with him. At one point, he even fights the Dark Knight in hand-to-hand combat. As it turns out, the Joker hired Clayface to impersonate him until he could find a way to cure the Titan disease, a fact hinted at during the battle if the player enters Detective Mode and sees that the "Joker" you're currently fighting doesn't have bones.
    -   The sequel, _Batman: Arkham Knight_ pulls off a similar trick with Henry Adams. At first, it seems like he's the only one of the four people who were inadvertently given the Joker's poisoned blood to not be suffering from any ill effects, to the point where he's Batman's greatest hope for a cure. It's eventually revealed that Henry _is_ just as sick as the others—he just hid it better to string the Dark Knight along.
