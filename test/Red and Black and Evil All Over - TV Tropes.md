_"Our race is marked by jet black and crimson skin. Just like you..."_

Black and red. In western culture, these are the two most sinister colors, as red typically conveys the meaning of blood or anger, and black is that of darkness or death. Being a very visually striking combination, they can also convey a sense of power. Together, they can also give the impression of burning coal or wood, i.e. "fire and destruction". Sticking to these two colors is common for designers who want to create something as sinister as possible.

A favorite color for villainous characters to dress in (when they aren't wearing purple, green, and orange). For example, most Ominous Opera Capes are a case of this: black on the outside, red on the inside (which is _really_ common with vampires). It should be noted that this trope is not just a list of villains wearing black and red; it can apply to non-character elements as well. For example, this is common for the covers and credit sequences of horror books, films, and games, to show that a work is Darker and Edgier.

Historically, red and black (along with white) were heavily used in Nazi Germany's symbols, so The Empire displaying these colors in its flags and architecture may give the impression of Putting on the Reich, even if the associated characters themselves don't wear them. See Red and Black Totalitarianism.

Dark Is Not Evil can also apply with Anti Heroes and even Villain Protagonists heavily using a red and black color scheme as a visual reminder that these people, no matter how much we are supposed to identify with them, are not "good guys". Or that the concepts associated with this color scheme, such as darkness, blood, or fire, are not that evil to begin with. Can also be used to benefit from Evil is Cool without resorting to actual evil. If a heroic character wears this, they may be an example of a Terror Hero, or of Good Is Not Nice at the bare minimum. It's not uncommon for cases of this to be juxtaposed with a group of characters represented by blue and white. If the hero is represented by the colors blue and white, The Rival or an Evil Counterpart may have the black and red color scheme.

A Sub-Trope of Good Colors, Evil Colors. A Sister Trope to Evil Wears Black.

Compare Dark Is Evil, Grayscale of Evil, Red Eyes, Take Warning, Red Filter of Doom, and Obviously Evil, as well as Big Red Devil. Contrast Gold and White Are Divine, Heavenly Blue, Red Is Heroic, Movie Superheroes Wear Black, and Primary-Color Champion, where blue takes the place of black. Compare or Contrast Dark Is Not Evil and Red Is Violent for anti-hero/anti-villain examples, as well as Mysterious Purple for people with less defined and often obscured allegiances and moral leanings.

See also White and Red and Eerie All Over, which is portrayed as ghastly in addition to being sinister.

**Note: In case of characters, this trope mostly applies to villains and anti-heroes.**

    Advertising 

-   In _The Myth of Orpheus and Eurydice_, Aristaeus and Hades, the two antagonists, dress exclusively in red and black. The snake that kills Eurydice is a red-and-black coral snake, and Hades' underground nightclub is lit in harsh red and blue light that blends to look black.
-   This ad for _Virtual Boy Wario Land_ depicts Wario in this manner while showing him laughing maniacally and sneaking through a cave. It is also meant to mirror the red-and-black graphics of the Virtual Boy.
-   An early TV ad for the LEGO _Star Wars_ toyline showed a kid building a ship out of LEGOs, followed by Darth Maul's voice asking "Got anything in red and black?", after his own use of these colors, as seen in the film section.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Femto from _Berserk_ is black with red eyes, but as Griffith the colors of this trope are inverted.
-   Downplayed with the Guren from _Code Geass_: red, orange and black... and part of a Well-Intentioned Extremist faction.
-   The Chevaliers in _Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!_ have black uniforms with red and gold trim.
-   _Dragon Ball Super_ introduces Goku Black, Goku's Evil Doppelgänger, who wears black clothing with a red sash, and has a Super Mode that turns his hair pink. After Black performs a Fusion Dance with Future Zamasu, the result wears black Supreme Kai-style clothing with red trim.
-   The Homunculi from _Fullmetal Alchemist_ have black and red as their primary colour palette.
-   _The King of Braves GaoGaiGar_ features a mech that is colored Red and Black and is even feared as a God of Destruction by its enemies. However, this is subverted as a case of Dark Is Not Evil; narration tells us at length that destruction is necessary as nothing new will come without the old first being destroyed.
-   The various _Gundam_ series have multiple examples of this...
    -   In _After War Gundam X_, the Frost Brothers' personal Gundams, in differing proportions; older brother Shagia's Virsago is predominantly crimson with plenty of black accents, while younger brother Olba's Ashtaron is mostly black with some red accents.
    -   Likewise, Clotho Buer's Raider Gundam in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_, as well as Stella Loussier's Gaia Gundam and the Dark Dagger L from _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_, and the 105 Slaughter Dagger from _Gundam SEED C.E.73 Stargazer_.
    -   On a larger scale, there's the Dominion from _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ — it's the sister ship to the heroic Archangel, but flying the flag of the villainous anti-Coordinator 'Blue Cosmos' organization... so of course it trades in the Archangel's dashing white-red-blue color-scheme for black-and-red with gold accents. Just to make sure nobody's going to get confused about which ship the good guys are on, even if they're otherwise identical.
    -   Subverted by Deathscythe Hell from _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_; it's black and red, and it sure _looks_ evil thanks to its bat motif, but its pilot is a pretty friendly Lancer compared to the stoic hero (who has an angel motif) and most definitely a hero.
    -   Char Aznable starts out with a red and black Zeon uniform but years later as Quatro it gets subverted but then played straight again in _Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack_ with his new red and black outfit and his Sazabi.
        -   In _Beltorchika's Children_, Char pilots the Nightingale, which has red and black colors like the Sazabi. Interestingly, his rival, Amuro Ray, pilots the Hi-Nu Gundam, which has blue and white colors.
        -   Some of Char's Clones fit.
        -   Full Frontal having a red and black outfit and his Sinanju is red and black.
        -   Zechs with his red and black uniform he later pilots the red and black Gundam Epyon.
        -   Zeheart Galette is an Anti-Villain, wears a red coat and black clothes underneath, and pilots red mobile suits. Likewise, Captain Ash dresses predominantly in red and black and pilots a black-and-red Gundam, but is definitely not evil.
        -   Subverted by Johnny Ridden, whose Ace Custom colors are crimson and black; by all accounts, he was a good person, even though he fought for Zeon.
    -   The very evil Titans in _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_ use this color scheme, as does the Psyco Gundam, which has a tendency to drive its pilots insane. The heroes even repaint a black Gundam Mk-II white after stealing it from the Titans.
    -   _Gundam Build Fighters_ plays this straight. After Tatsuya Yuki is forcibly brainwashed by Mashita in the final round of the Gunpla World Tournament, his Amazing Exia is redesigned to look much more sinister, complete with a black and red paint job. While Tatsuya himself wore an all-black outfit during the tournament, he is given a slightly different one featuring a crimson scarf to go with it.
-   Ai Enma from _Hell Girl_ has this twice: she has black hair with red eyes and her standard costume is a black sailor uniform with a red collar. She also happens to be a Villain Protagonist.
-   Alucard from _Hellsing_. The guy has black hair and red eyes, wears a black suit with a long red coat and hat, and it's all usually drenched in blood.
-   In _Infinite Stratos_, Laura's IS is also this color scheme, possibly as a Shout-Out to Elzam, as the series likes to reference other mecha anime. And she does a Heel–Face Turn as well (sort of).
-   An inversion in _Kill la Kill_. You have Ryuko Matoi, who has black hair with a red streak, wears a predominantly black and red outfit... and is the main character and firmly Chaotic Good, though she _is_ an Anti-Hero. Meanwhile, the antagonists all wear traditional "good guy" colors: Satsuki's Kamui is white, Nui wears a cutesy pink lolita outfit, and Ragyo's outfits are also predominantly white and usually also shining with all colors of the rainbow.
    -   This is actually a recurring motif in the series. The protagonist's various forms begin to look increasingly demonic as the series progresses, adding spikes, devil horns, and other Obviously Evil signifiers. She still remains good until being exposed to More than Mind Control and getting sewn into Satsuki's white Kamui.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   Fate Testarossa, The Dragon and Dark Magical Girl of the first season with an outfit sporting a black and red theme. Eventually gets befriended, and later sports a barrier jacket that adds more white to her color scheme.
    -   Reinforce Eins from _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_, the physical manifestation of the Book of Darkness who wears a black outfit with red belts all over her body and red markings on her face. Once the Darkness of the Book of Darkness is destroyed, the red belts and markings disappear, showing that she's finally free of its destructive influence.
    -   Inverted with Voltaire, who looks the part (being a massive red and black dragon with a somewhat demonic appearance), but is actually the benevolent guardian deity of Caro's home planet.
    -   The Unbreakable Dark from _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's Portable: The Gears of Destiny_, whose white and pink outfit takes a more sinister red and black whenever her God-like powers go out of control and force her to kill everyone and destroy everything around her against her will.
    -   Downplayed with Iris from _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Reflection_. Since she's an Anti-Villain, she wears salmon pink and dark gray rather than red and black. Played straight when she shows her true colors and switches over to a magenta and black ensemble. Her post-Heel–Face Turn outfits also lack any dark colors.
-   Judar from _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_ follows this color scheme to a T. He's the Darker and Edgier Foil to Aladdin, and Artistic License often gives him glowing red eyes when he's using black Rukh.
-   In _Metropolis (2001)_ Rock mainly wears black pants with suspenders and a red turtleneck sweater, the red standing for his violent, murderous tendencies.
-   In _Miracle Wanda_, the Bugmin, who are Brainwashed and Crazy versions of the friendly Promin, are recognizable by their signature red, black, and gray color schemes.
-   The Akatsuki from _Naruto_ wear long black coats with a red cloud pattern on them.
    -   The Sharingan of the Uchiha are red and black.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ depicts Gendo Ikari, a ruthless commander and abusive parent, wearing a black coat over his red clothing, with a pair of orange shades thrown in for good measure.
-   In _Pokémon: The Series_, Tepig's former trainer, who abandoned it because he deemed it weak, wears a black jacket with red accents and calls his team the "Fire Warriors".
    -   Most members of Team Rocket wear black suits with red Rs on the fronts... plus, a lot of their equipment tends to be red and black. Jessie and James are really the only exceptions, seeing as their suits are white. But then, most of the time, they are less evil.
-   _Pretty Cure_:
    -   The second villain of _Futari wa Pretty Cure_, Poisony, has red and black hair and wears a black jumpsuit and black cape with a red underside.
    -   _Fresh Pretty Cure!_: This can be seen in both of Setsuna Higashi's forms, though, while Eas plays it straight, Cure Passion subverts it by becoming good.
    -   Regina from _Doki Doki Pretty Cure_ initially plays this straight, then subverts it by wearing black and purple while brainwashed and switching back to the black and red color scheme after her Heel–Face Turn.
-   Princess Kraehe (and, by extension, the Monster Raven and Raven!Mytho) from _Princess Tutu_. The red part is mostly due to Red Eyes, Take Warning.
-   Kyoko Sakura from _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ first appears as a sadistic, uncaring, egocentric nightmare of a magical girl. She's also a Fiery Evil Redhead who wears a primarily blood-red outfit with some black in it. Subverted later on when she does a Heel–Face Turn.
-   This was also done in the _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_ parody of _James Bond_ to mark the villain.
-   Most of the shots of the Big Bad Ashura in the 4th credit sequence in _Soul Eater_ are colored Red, Black, Grey, and inspired by insanity.
-   Heathcliff from _Sword Art Online_ has red armor with black cloths underneath and turns out to be the Big Bad Akihiko Kayaba.
-   _Sword of the Stranger_ movie has the Ming Squad, a group of Chinese warriors who chase Kotaro to use his blood as an ingredient of an immortality elixir. They wear red capes and rather dark conical hats and clothes. The notable exception is their leader, Bai-Luan who wears a white and gold robe.
-   _Tekkaman Blade_ has a main rival who sports this color theme. Bonus points for being named Tekkaman Evil.
-   In _Tenchi Universe_, Kagato Jurai's Laser Blade is black with a red outline to contrast Tenchi's, which is blueish white.
-   _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_:
    -   These are the colors of the villains of the game the protagonist Leon transmigrated into, the Principality of Fanoss, a seperatist state with the two Princesses "leading" it having Raven Hair, Ivory Skin to match.
    -   This is also the coloring of the demons spouting from the eventually corrupted World Tree of Alzer, from the second game.
-   _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_ has Kurogane, the resident badass Ninja. His default outfit is almost completely black only with a little red, he has black hair, red eyes and dark skin, and is the only one of the main characters not associated with the Big Bad. Funny how his partner is his complete opposite.
-   Yuuko Ichihara from _×××HOLiC_ has long black hair and red eyes, but she is definitely not evil. She does operate outside standard ideas of "good", though, such as granting wishes knowing that they may lead to the person's death.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ had two frequently recurring dragons, which subverted this. One was Kaiba's majestic-looking Light-Attribute _Blue-Eyes White Dragon_, which he had the only three existing copies of (originally, there were four, but he destroyed the last one solely so it could never be used against him, while also increasing the value of the remaining three). The other was the slightly weaker Dark-Attribute counterpart, _Red-Eyes B. Dragon_, which, as the name implies, is an evil-looking black dragon with red eyes. Red-Eyes was used primarily by Joey Wheeler, one of the heroes, whereas Blue-Eyes was used by Seto Kaiba, an Anti-Hero, who doubles as a Jerk With A Heart Of Jerk. While Kaiba isn't evil per se, he isn't really good either. Ironically, When Joey was Marik's mind slave and forced to fight Yugi in a duel to the death, Yugi was the one using Red-Eyes, hoping to get through to Joey and make him snap out of Marik's mind control.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_:
    -   Astral's Evil Counterpart Black Mist/No. 96 is primarily black, red, and teal.
    -   Chaos Number 39: Kibou'ou Hope Ray V subverts it. His armor and swords are black/dark purple and red/dark magenta (depending on how you look it), making him look sinister. Given that this form is the Barian version of Hope's Chaos forms, the sinister-looking colors are invoked to make the connection to the Barians more obvious. Dark Is Not Evil comes into play, as Hope Ray V is not only a LIGHT monster, but also not evil on his own. The one time he plays it straight, it's a case of My Master, Right or Wrong.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V_: Supreme King Dragon Z-ARC subverts this by being green and black, rather than red and black (although his eyes are red). His color scheme still takes the spirit of this trope, as his glowing green marks covering his black body still make him look very evil.

    Arts 

-   Alexandre Cabanel's _The Fallen Angel_: Heavily downplayed but Lucifer's main hues are his red hair and blackening wings.

    Asian Animation 

-   _BoBoiBoy_: Subverted in BoBoiBoy Thunderstorm's debut. When he appeared, his outfit turned black with red glowing highlights and lightning insignias. He was unlocked out of rage and he first wore a red-eyed Death Glare. However, he was only "evil" because the villains exploited his weakness — the longer the elementals were split up, the worse his memory became — and claimed they were his friends. His memory and good allegiance eventually return by the end of the episode.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: The villain Wolnie is a dark gray wolf who wears red clothes.

    Comic Books 

-   Seems to be popular with _Batman_ spin-off characters these days. While Batman and his protege are heroic, they use the color scheme to appear sinister and intimidating or to achieve Villain Cred when they need to, making this an Invoked Trope.
    -   Nightwing has donned a red-and-black outfit in the _New 52_ to reflect the new, grittier Nightwing.
    -   Tim Drake (known as "Robin" or "Red Robin" depending on the time period) uses this color scheme. He's been wearing red and black since after his best friend was killed by Superboy-Prime in _Infinite Crisis_. Before that, he used the standard-issue Robin palette of red, green, and yellow with more emphasis on green than any other Robins.
        
        **Jimmy:** No green anymore, huh? Just black and red. What's the deal with the new suit?  
        **Robin:** (looking at Superboy's memorial statue) They were his colors.
        
    -   The Red Hood wears primarily black and red. Both of them, the Joker before he went all smiley and Jason Todd after he comes back as a murderer. Jason later subverts this after his Heel–Face Turn.
    -   The Joker's sidekick Harley Quinn wears a black and red playing card motif.
    -   Before all of these examples, Jean Paul-Valley changed his armored Batman costume into a red-and-gold version color scheme just before confronting Bruce Wayne as the "real" Batman, indicating that he's already jumped off the slippery slope.
    -   Bane wears a black costume and his mask is often drawn with red eyepieces.
    -   The second Batman in _Earth 2_ wears a Batsuit that is black with red trimmings. He is not evil, but compared to the previous Batman, he is more an Anti-Hero.
    -   Simon Dark isn't actually affiliated with Batman, but he's a Gotham based anti-hero who wears red and black stripes and is _far_ less opposed to killing than the Bats.
    -   Omega, the Big Bad of _Batman: Last Knight on Earth_ wears a black (and grey) costume with red accents and is trying to conquer the planet. It's also a case of Evil Clostume Switch as Omega is, in fact, the original Bruce Wayne, now a Fallen Hero.
    -   The Reaper costume is predominantly red and black, with a white skull mask, and is intended to make the wearer look like the Grim Reaper. The first and the third Reapers were murderous vigilantes, while the second was the son of the man who murdered the Waynes and was looking to kill the man who killed his father.

-   A number of characters in _The Beano_ and its imitators wear red and black with the 'anti-hero protagonist' connotation, such as Dennis the Menace, his Distaff Counterpart Minnie the Minx, and Manipulative Bastard Roger the Dodger.
-   In the New 52's _Blue Beetle_, Blue's Evil Counterpart Blood Beetle has a red and black color scheme, in contrast to Blue Beetle's blue and black color scheme.
-   _Captain America_: The Red Skull has a red skull for a head, and usually wears black. He's as evil as they come.
-   Deadpool's red suit with black stripes and matching red and black hood. Subverted in that he's not evil (usually). He's just _crazy_.
-   _Doctor Strange_ foe Dormammu has a black Badass Longcoat with large red plates, as well as a red Battle Aura and the small fact that his head is on fire.
-   The so-called "brainwashed Superman" who was working for Darkseid in _Earth 2_ has a red-and-black uniform.
-   _Green Lantern_: The Red Lantern Corps has this coloration and they are raging berserkers.
-   Many _Grendel_ comics are three-colour, using only black, white, and red highlights. The symbolism is quite deliberate.
-   Inverted by _Hellboy_, who certainly looks the part but is (usually) the good guy.
-   _Judge Dredd_: The Judges' uniforms in the Alternate Universe that became Deadworld was solid black leather with red shoulder pads, whereas the Judges' uniforms from Judge Dredd's universe are dark blue leather with gold shoulder pads. Unsurprisingly, they were much more brutal and prone to wanton executions than their counterpart even before the Dark Judges took over.
-   _Jupiter Jet_: Pluto, the Big Bad, wears a black outfit with red lining.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   Carnage is a Serial Killer bonded to a red and black alien parasite that grants him Lovecraftian Superpowers.
    -   Introduced as a _Spider-Man_ villain but later turned into an Anti-Hero, Morbius the Living Vampire's Iconic Outfit is red and black. Originally his eyes were shown as pink but were later changed to red, making his entire color scheme white-black-red.
    -   Spider-Man himself was meant to invoke this trope despite his costume being made out of two primary colors, as the red and dark blue coloring, in addition to his gymnastics and mask with its creepy eye holes was meant to be unsettling.
    -   Spider-Man's clone, Kaine, very much invokes this as the second Scarlet Spider, with a red and black costume rendered even creepier by the creepy eye holes on the mask, and a set of stingers. He's also prone to killing, maiming, and torturing his enemies. Good is very definitely not nice.
    -   Otto Octavius, after becoming the Superior Spider-Man, wears a red costume that replaces the blues of Spider-Man's normal suit with black.
-   _Star Wars Infinities — A New Hope_ has Luke and Han on Coruscant, encountering the red-robed Imperial Guard. In standard canon, they are commando-stormtroopers, which is bad enough, but in this, they are armed with lightsabers.
    
    **Han:** They're wearing _red robes_, Luke. Tell me what it means when they wear red suits, Luke...  
    **Luke:** I think it means trouble.
    
-   Superman: Most of the members of the Superman family wear blue-and-red-and-yellow costumes. However, ambiguous or evil versions of the Super-family generally go for red and black.
    -   _Supergirl_: In _Red Daughter of Krypton_ Supergirl became a Red Lantern -Red Lanterns are raging berserkers-, and although she was not evil, she was _definitely_ darker, edgier and angrier. And she wore a red-and-black costume.
    -   Black Zero, an evil alternate version of Superboy (Kon-El/Conner Kent) wears a black bodysuit with a red sash and red cape.
    -   Superboy uses this color scheme in regards to Superman's trademark "S" for his New 52 incarnation, where his costume is completely red-and-black. While Superboy is a hero, the opening issue of his comic (as well as the rebooted _Teen Titans_ comic) uses the color scheme to make him seem sinister.
    -   The Cyborg Superman has made a few bodies with this color scheme, notably his Apokolipian-based body when he hopped off of Doomsday in _Hunter/Prey_ and his _Sinestro Corps War_ body.
    -   Composite Superman combines Superman's and Batman's costumes, resulting in a mixture of red, black, blue, and yellow. This oddly combines this trope with Primary-Color Champion. For a more fitting combination of tropes, his skin is green.
-   During the Red Hulk's incarnation of the Thunderbolts, the entire team wore red and black, including both The Punisher and Agent Venom, who are noted for wearing black and white. When Deadpool calls Venom a suck-up for changing his colors with the rest of them, the former soldier strangles Deadpool, telling him that keeping the same color means there's less of a chance for Friendly Fire.
-   Ultimate Marvel
    -   _The Ultimates_: While her mainstream counterpart is a hero, the Black Widow is an Evil Redhead who (like her main counterpart) wears black. She is revealed to be a traitor to the team in the second volume.
    -   _Ultimate X-Men_: In contrast to the strictly red 616 Juggernaut, this Juggernaut's outfit is primarily black, but with lots of red dots/lights on it.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   In Volume 1, _Sensation Comics_ and _Comic Cavalcade_ in the 'verse that would later be termed "Earth-Two" the sadistic Saturnian Emperor and his agents all wear red and black, have horns, and parts of their skin are splotched/patterned with red.
    -   In his manifestation as Mars, the War God Ares trades his signature blued armor for red armor and keeps his shadowed face and glowing red eyes. During the Greg Rucka run, his appearance was a blonde man with red eyes and black clothing.
    -   There is also Dark Angel, an evil version of Donna Troy from another Earth who has black hair and wears a red dress and boots.
    -   The _New 52_ and _DC Rebirth_ depict the sorceress Circe as an Evil Redhead who often wears black.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Mr. Sinister is a Mad Scientist with chalk-white skin and red eyes. He wears black clothing.
    -   While under the control of the Hellfire Club, Jean Grey wore a black Stripperiffic outfit which when combined with her red hair gave her this aesthetic.
    -   Jean's clone Madelyene Pryor took to wearing black after Face–Heel Turn. She also has red hair just like her progenitor.
    -   Nightcrawler's Archnemesis Dad Azrael is a demonic-looking Mutant with red skin and black hair. His clothing is also black.
-   Though definitely not villains, the new X-Force team Cyclops assembled (including Deadpool, Warpath and Wolverine), which was created to do missions none of the... "regular" teams were up to, all wore black and grey ...and for some reason, all had red-tinted lenses in their masks.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: Towards the end of this _Godzilla_ MonsterVerse fanfiction, Keizer Ghidorah covers the sky in a broiling, lightning-filled tempest which casts red light and black shadows over the terrain.
-   The Mirror Universe Smurfs in the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Smurfed Behind: The Other Side Of The Mirror" are mostly red-skinned and wear black clothing and are constantly evil — the opposite of the good blue-and-white Smurfs of the normal universe. Its Papa Smurf is red-skinned and wears blue, while its version of Empath wears white clothes with black stars on it, however.
-   _Fate of the Clans_: Cú Chulainn Alter has black armor with veins of red on it and his skin.
-   In chapter 1 part 11 of SilfofinaDragon's Sengoku Basara fanfic _Finally Home_, Toyotomi Hideyoshi's tragically wicked daughter Kagehime appears in a black kimono, described with having red flowers on it.
-   _Guys Being Dudes_: The main colors of Arlo's outfit and hair, as in canon. He retains his affiliation with Team GO Rocket from _Pokémon GO_ canon and gains Card-Carrying Villain tendencies.
-   _Infinity Train: Blossoming Trail_: UnChloe wears a pretty black dress, has a black crown decorated with garnets and long red hair. She's also a sadistic manifestation of a child's worst impulses.
-   Downplayed in the _Junior Officers_ chapter "The Undersea Twister"; Deborah wears red and black because she's angry.
-   _Miraculous: The Phoenix Rises_ has The Nightmare King show up at the end of chapter 15, a knight clad in blood red and pitch black armor who's first onscreen action is massacring a squad of guards without mercy or remorse.
-   _The Night Unfurls_:
    -   Not evil, but Kyril is still an anti-heroic Terror Hero whose eyes blaze red occasionally (in the remastered version, they are always red), garbed in dark grey attire. The "red" part is more pronounced whenever he is covered in gore, head to toe.
    -   One of his apprentices, Sanakan, is an Inversion. Assuming that the Old Hunter Set she wears looks exactly the same as that in _Bloodborne_, her Badass Longcoat is a case of dark on the outside, red on the inside. She's actually one of the heroes.
-   _Son of the Sannin_: Played with in the case of Fugaku Uchiha whose Susanoo is red and black (even wielding a dual bladed-katana as a full Shout-Out to Darth Maul, seen below). While he was an antagonist when he was alive (and even then he was at most an Anti-Villain rather than outright evil), he doesn't use this ability until the Fourth Ninja War as an Edo Tensei zombie, and by then he's not even a willing antagonist anymore.
-   _Total Drama Legacy_'s Big Bad, Emilia Burromuerto, wears a red and black outfit.
-   _Twinkling in the Dark_: Chapter 21 briefly features an evil version of Candy, who has black ear-buns and wears a red bow with a skull, instead of her normal yellow ear-buns and magenta bows.
-   In the _Undertale_ au _Underfell_, in which all the monsters are more vicious and wholly willing to murder Frisk on sight, the monsters tend to be redesigned with red and black tones. Subverted with Frisk, who wears a red and black-striped shirt but is an unambiguously sweet kid.
-   _We Can Be Heroes! (Steven Universe)_: Val Kazkani is a brutal Hopkoblin mob boss who wears a snazzy red and black pinstripe suit, and rules the port town of Krapton with an iron fist.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _9_, The Fabrication Machine is a towering, spider-like robot with a black frame and a single red eye, and it's hellbent on wiping out the Stitchpunks and taking over what's left of the ruined world.
-   Unsurprisingly, this is the color scheme of a lot of Disney villains, though it has also been given to some non-villanous characters.
    -   Jafar from _Aladdin_ wears black with red trim, and has a black beard. His cobra form has a black upperside with stripes and the underside of his hood being red. His genie form is a muscular red devil with a black topknot and black beard.
    -   This applies to the red and black Queen Of Hearts from _Alice in Wonderland_.
    -   Cruella DeVil, the villain of _101 Dalmatians_, primarily wears a white fur coat with a red underside over a black dress and red gloves. Her car is also colored red and black.
    -   The black-haired Mother Gothel from _Tangled_ wears a red dress and often a black cape over that too. Her color combination sharply contrasts with that of her "daughter" Rapunzel's golden hair and lavender dress.
    -   Professor Ratigan, the arch-villain of _The Great Mouse Detective_, wears a black suit with a red Ominous Opera Cape.
    -   Gaston from _Beauty and the Beast_ is a black-haired, muscle-bound hunter who wears a blood-red shirt and black trousers, and he goes from an amusing Small Name, Big Ego character to being the main villain of the film.
    -   Scar from _The Lion King (1994)_ is an evil lion with reddish-orange fur and a black mane.
    -   _Peter Pan_'s nemesis, Captain Hook, wears a red jacket with a red pirate hat and has black hair.
    -   Frollo from _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ wears a mostly black and purple suit, but with small red adornments.
    -   _The Incredibles_ inverts the trope with the titular Parr family, who are given Super suits of red and black colors (along with a touch of gold). The villain Syndrome and some of his henchmen go for the black and white contrast (which in this case, despite what Good Colors, Evil Colors generally tells, does not represent neutrality). The final Omnidroid, on the other hand, plays the trope straight by having a bright red eye to match its black metal body.
    -   The Duke of Weselton wears red and black colors in _Frozen_ and his Establishing Character Moment is him muttering darkly about how he plans to exploit Arendelle. While he does play a minor antagonistic role, in that he orders his two henchmen to take out Elsa if presented the opportunity, he turns out to actually be more of a Red Herring for Hans.
    -   Te Kā in _Moana_ is a large volcanic entity, and thus there's plenty of red and black in her body to go against her fiery eyes. However, her villainy is subverted. She is actually Te Fiti, overcome with rage at having her Heart stolen from her. As soon as the Heart is returned, she reverts to being the gentle island entity she normally is — and, notably, she turns green.
-   DreamWorks Animation plays with this trope around a bit:
    -   The _Shrek_ franchise has a couple straight examples:
        -   The normal outfit of Lord Farquaad, the Big Bad of _Shrek_, is mostly red and black with some gold.
        -   The Wolf, one of the villains in the Big Bad Ensemble from _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_, has red eyes and a black cloak, and while he's not the most evil character or largest threat in the film, he's definitely menacing and has a personal score to settle with Puss in Boots, especially come the reveal that he's Death itself.
    -   Scenes featuring Lord Shen in _Kung Fu Panda 2_ tend to feature a lot of red and black. It's also combined with White and Red and Eerie All Over in that Shen himself has a white and red color scheme.
    -   Inverted in _How to Train Your Dragon 2_. Toothless is a pitch-black dragon with a red replacement tail fin, yet he's completely loyal to the friendly and amicable Hiccup, whose new outfit is also the same colors as his dragon companion.
    -   Red and black is the signature color scheme of the Rock Trolls in _Trolls World Tour_, although most of them don't dress with it (their leader Queen Barb is the only relevant example); instead, it's the coloration of their home and appliances. The trope is subverted by the end of the movie when they redeem themselves.
    -   Downplayed in _The Bad Guys (2022)_. The characters' orientations are expressed in the colors of their clothes. Cooler colors like black and blue represent the heroes, while hotter colors like red and white identify the villains.
-   In _Gandahar_, the genocidal Metal Men are jet black robots with red "eyes".
-   _The LEGO Movie_: Lord Business when he dons his villain outfit. Even his robot secret police enforce this trope.
-   In _The Mitchells vs. the Machines_, the Pal MAX Prime robots are clad in black armor plating and have glowing red innards and a single glowing red eye, and are by far and away the deadliest servants of PAL.
-   Ruber from _Quest for Camelot_ is an Evil Redhead who wears a black cleavage and trousers with red armor, boots, belt, wrist cuffs, and shoulder pads. Much later on towards the end of the film when Ruber bonded Excalibur to himself, his mechanical right arm has ascending shades of black to red all over.
-   In _Rock-A-Doodle_, The Grand Duke of Owls wears a black and red cape.
-   In _The Swan Princess_, the hag magically disguised as Princess Odette wears a black and red dress. This makes her easy for viewers to distinguish from the real Odette, who wears white and green.
-   The whole army of the One-Eye from _The Thief and the Cobbler_ uses these colors to overkill.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Cropsy in _The Burning_, due to the combination of his disfigured red skin, and black wardrobe.
-   _The Dark Knight Rises_: During the stock exchange heist, Bane sports a red motorcycle helmet as part of his deliveryman disguise.
-   Subverted in _Dracula Untold_: While he wears exclusively black and red as part of his costumes and earned a sinister reputation as "Lord Impaler", he shows shame for his previous actions and uses his powers to defend his family and his people.
-   _Face/Off_: While Castor Troy mostly averts this, the scene just before the first action setpiece (the airport gun battle) sees his dark red suit and red dress shirt complemented by a billowing black Badass Longcoat.
-   _Godzilla_:
    -   The MUTOs from _Godzilla (2014)_ are black with glowing red markings.
    -   The version of Godzilla himself in _Shin Godzilla_ is black and red glowing rashes all over his body.
-   In some of the Hammer Dracula films Christopher Lee wears a black outfit with red piping on the cape.
-   In _Heathers_, these are the school colors. This means the antagonistic cheerleaders wear red and black.
-   The Thuggee cult in _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom_ wear these colors to match their volcanic hideout.
-   The 1973 _Jesus Christ Superstar_ film has the high priests Caiaphas and Ananias who wear all-black. In the climax where Jesus is sentenced to death, they also wear red capes.
-   _John Wick_: Viggo's dark gray suits are usually accompanied with red dress shirts.
-   The _Pteranodons_ from _Jurassic World_ have primarily red and black color schemes and are fairly aggressive predators. Some of them have different color schemes, however (some of them have blue where others have red).
-   In _Kick-Ass 2_, the clothes of the superheroes are mixed, but almost all of the supervillains wear clothes that are red and black.
-   In _The Last Starfighter_ the invading Kodan fleet all wore uniforms of red with black touches (Xur wore all black, but he was a traitor from Rylos working with the Kodan).
-   _The Lord of the Rings_ has the entire country and society build around that trope. Mordor is a black land with red lava and the mountain of Mount Doom which has a red peak. This is completed by the main tower, Barad-Dur, which is all-black and on top, we have the red and flaming giant Eye of Sauron (unlike the book, the movie implies this is Sauron's actual current form).
-   The Master's robes in _Manos: The Hands of Fate_ are black with a red hand motif.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   _Captain America: The First Avenger_: HYDRA uniforms are black and their emblem is red. Applies even more to Red Skull, as the skin on his face mutated after taking Dr. Erskine's serum.
    -   _Avengers: Age of Ultron_: Wanda Maximoff is a dark-haired girl who wears black dresses paired with red jackets or shawls, her magic glows red, and she works for the bad guys until she pulls a Heel–Face Turn.
    -   _Spider-Man: Homecoming Trilogy_: Played with. While firmly heroic, Peter's adoption of the red and black Upgraded Suit at the end of _Far From Home_ coincides with him being framed and unmasked to the world for the murder of Mysterio, which plunges him firmly into his comics self's status quo and causes him no small amount of grief throughout _No Way Home_.
-   In _The Matrix_, the Machines and their pods emit red or sickly pink glows, and their physically metallic bodies (such as those of the sentinels) are very dark (though this could be due to the general poor lighting). Taken to an extreme in the _The Animatrix_ short "Matriculated", where machines emit a warm, peaceful green glow when they turn good and seem less dark.
-   _Ra.One_ is an invoked example, as the (video game escapee) villain Ra.One was deliberately designed to be as cool and menacing as possible, with spiderweb-like black armor, black cowl, red Heart Light, and glowing red eyes.
-   The uniforms, flags, and other props used in Ian McKellen's excellent 1995 film adaptation of _Richard III_ are like this, due to the film's use of parallels to Nazi Germany in its 1930s-era Setting Update.
-   _Saw_:
    -   When out in the testing field, Jigsaw usually wears a black cloak with a red interior drawn up.
    -   Amanda Young wears a red cloak alongside a pig mask with black hair when capturing victims. She also dresses in a more casual red and black outfit in _Saw III_.
    -   Dr. Lawrence Gordon is briefly seen with a cloak similar to Jigsaw's in the flashback from _Saw 3D_ that reveals his identity as the mysterious figure from the video tape in the opening scene of _Saw II_.
    -   Billy the Puppet has this for a color scheme, with a little white thrown in as well.
-   In _The School for Good and Evil (2022)_, the whole of the School of Evil adopts an all-black aesthetic, for obvious reasons, but Rafal also uses red as a primary color, as fitting for a Blood Magic user.
-   _Sleepy Hollow (1999)_: The Hessian Horseman's outfit is black with red and silver accents. Almost unnoticeable when he's dead and rotten all over. Action figures show it better
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)_, Dr. Robotnik wears a black suit and a black coat with red linings inside for most of the film. Near the climax, he switches to a red and black flight suit more in line with his traditional outfit.
-   Most Sith Lords in _Star Wars_ dress in black and wield a red lightsaber.
    -   In _Return of the Jedi_, The Emperor's guards wear these colors.
    -   Emperor Palpatine himself wears black and sometimes red robes. Also, the decor of his office is almost all red.
    -   Darth Maul (pictured above), who made full-body, red-and-black Sith tattoos popular. You'll find them on lots of Expanded Universe characters (not to mention the original Sith species, which has naturally red skin).
    -   _The Force Awakens_ continues the trend with The First Order and their Nazi-inspired red-and-black aesthetic (their fleet is even commanded by a black-clad Evil Redhead).
-   _TRON_:
    -   In the original film, Sark and his underlings were given red Tron Lines to distinguish themselves from Kevin Flynn, Tron, and the more benign programs, who had blue Tron Lines. However, the color of their suits was grey as opposed to black.
    -   Come _TRON: Legacy_ and the villains are all colored black with bright orange Tron Lines (Except for CLU, who is yellow). When Rinzler (actually Tron Brainwashed and Crazy and Reforged into a Minion) performs a Heel–Face Turn, his lines switch to the blue-white from before as he sinks into the data ocean.
    -   Downplayed in the franchise's Expanded Universe. Red and black are the color of the System Guard (essentially the military). They're often, but not always antagonistic, such as in _TRON 2.0_ where they're attacking the Player Character because they mistakenly believe he's responsible for a viral attack. Once they realize he's on the same side, they call it off and work with him during the assault on Thorne's server. And in TRON: Uprising, the System Guard is on Clu's side. However, they range from the outright amoral (Pavel) to the Lawful Evil type (Dyson, Tesler), to Anti-Villain (Paige).
-   Fred Fenster of _The Usual Suspects_ is more of the Affably Evil variety, but still counts: his main outfit is a black suit with a red and always unbuttoned dress shirt underneath.
-   The Norsefire Party in the film version of _V for Vendetta_ uses a black and red logo, specifically in order to imply similarity to the Nazi party.
-   The basic color scheme of the neo-Nazis in Pink Floyd's _The Wall_? Black with red detail.
-   _X-Men Film Series_
    -   In _X-Men: The Last Stand_, the Juggernaut wears a maroon outfit with black highlights.
    -   _X-Men: First Class_: Azazel, a member of the Hellfire Club (which in the comic version goes for black and white costumes), wears black. His naturally red skin complements his suit. And at the end of the movie, Erik Lehnsherr has adopted a red vest and helmet with black pants and cape as his Evil Costume Switch to become Magneto.

    Literature 

-   _The Brothers Lionheart_: Evil Overlord Tengil always wears black armor and a helmet with a crest of red feathers.
-   In _The Chronicles Of Fid_, the eponymous supervillain Doctor Fid describes his own powered armor as follows: The armor was form-fitted and so thoroughly non-reflective that I seemed a silhouette, a six-and-a-half-foot man-shaped hole in the world. There were stars visible inside that blackness, pinpricks of light and color; looking upon my was gazing into the clearest night sky, entire galaxies encompassed within my being. Only at the armor's seams were any hint of a three-dimensional figure offered: from there an angry red glow seeped, as though something infernal was trapped inside.
-   The _Custodes Fidei_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  order in the _Deryni_ works have black robes with red belts and trim. Officially, the red is supposed to suggest allegiance to and protection for the House of Haldane. Guarding the Faith from what? From Deryni and their sympathizers, of course.
    -   The order's name can also call to mind the famous Latin question, "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Since they are an aspect of the corruption in the church, this is justified.
-   Count Dracula has black and red. He's the Trope Codifier for what the description talks about this trope and vampires in their capes.
-   _Go to Sleep (A Jeff the Killer Rewrite)_: Downplayed. For Halloween, Jeff's mother buys him a black hockey jersey with accents of red and white, and a Jason Voorhees mask at the center, with a Jason goalie mask to go with the costume. He wears the same clothes when he kills his family, but despite his Slasher Smile, he doesn't appear too happy doing the deed.
-   Played With in _Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation: Mo Dao Zu Shi_. Wei Wuxian's usual colors are red and black, and he has possibly the highest bodycount in the story and a pitch-black reputation to match (plus, there's the fact that he singlehandedly invented the entire practice of Necromancy). But as the story goes on, Wei Wuxian repeatedly shows himself to be a much better person than 90% of the cultivation world, who essentially pigeonholed him into being a villain because he wouldn't conform as they wished.
-   _The Great Zoo of China_: The most dangerous dragons are the red-bellied blacks, named after a venomous Australian snake.
-   In _Harry Potter_, the Big Bad Lord Voldemort is described as having red, cat-like eyes and wearing black robes.
-   In _Honor Harrington_, the PRH State Sec uniforms have red coats and black pants.
    -   The inmates of one StateSec prison world refer to them as the Black Legs, partly from the uniforms and partly to have a word for the enemy that didn't include the Havenites who were their fellow prisoners.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: Governor Caffour makes his first appearance as a villain wearing a red and black suit. It blends well with his new necrocraft.
-   Simultaneously used and subverted in the _League Of Princes_ series. Ruffian dresses in red and black, because he knows that bounty hunters tend to get color-based nicknames, and he wants to be "Ruffian the Black" or "Ruffian the Red". But he's such a sad sack that he just gets called "Ruffian the Blue".
-   In _The Lord of the Rings_, Sauron's forces use black banners and an insignia marked with a red eye.
    -   Russian Tolkien fanfiction loves portraying Feanorians dressed in these colors.
-   The seventh room in Edgar Allan Poe's "The Masque of the Red Death" is black with red stained-glass windows.
-   Pryrates in _Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn_ always wears bright red robes with black lining (red in particular is so strongly associated with him that he's often called "the Red Priest or "the Red Wizard). He's also the most purely evil character in the series — even the Big Bad (a hate-filled undead Omnicidal Maniac) is played with more sympathy than Pryrates<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   In the _Modesty Blaise_ novel _I, Lucifer_, Lucifer dresses entirely in red and black as part of his Devil Complex.
-   In the _Old Kingdom_ trilogy, the necromancer Hedge, one of the chief villains of the second two books, usually wears a suit of black chainmail with red plates. As he falls increasingly under the power of his master, Orannis the Destroyer, Hedge himself gradually transforms from a fairly normal-looking man to a creature of flame and shadow, thereby bringing the aesthetic into his own body as well.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Played with by Targaryens, who, while as a whole not any more good or evil than any other house, have a tendency, when evil, to be REALLY evil, and often Ax-Crazy. When these folks (Maegor The Cruel, Aerys "The Mad King") wear their house colors, they play this trope straight (or possibly subvert it, because in-universe meaning of these colors is different — depending on your point of view). Then again, decent members of the house often wear these colors too. Then there's the fact that the first king of this house could be alternatively seen as a Young Conqueror or as an Evil Overlord. Because you can't conquer the whole continent, especially with the aid of giant fire-breathing monsters, and be nice about it.
    -   House Blackfyre, on the other hand, played it straight. They are a Targaryen offshoot house that descended from Daemon Blackfyre<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and their colors are inverted Targaryen colors (a black three-headed dragon on red field). They have instigated five rebellions against the Iron Throne.
    -   Euron Greyjoy is among the worst of the worst, and he wears a red cloak and black armor in _The Winds of Winter_ preview chapters, which is significant because the armor is made of Valyrian steel.
    -   Drogon, the largest and wildest of Daenerys' three dragons, has black scales, red horns, spinal plates, and eyes, bleeds black blood, and breathes black fire tinged with red. He is said to be the second coming of Balerion, the dragon ridden by Aegon the Conqueror, who had the same traits.
-   In _The Spiral Labyrinth_, the magic system is color-coded; each wizard has a major and a minor color. The Big Bad uses black and red.
-   The Parshendi of _The Stormlight Archive_ are human-looking beings with marbled red and black skin, who have been embroiled in a war of extinction against the Alethi after assassinating their king for no known reason. They are also the setting's legendary Voidbringers, who can channel the power of Odium. Most of them aren't too pleased about this.
-   Raksha in _Tales of Kolmar_ are always red and black.
-   In _The Wheel of Time_:
    -   Moridin, most powerful and evil of the Forsaken, explicitly refers to black and red as his colors; he always wears them himself, forces his servants to do so, and they predominate the decorating of his fortress. Mazrim Taim, who is a rather sinister fellow despite nominally being on the sign of good, also likes the colors, hinting at a possible connection between them. Eventually it is revealed that Taim is indeed The Mole and a Darkfriend.
    -   This theme is also reflected in the Aes Sedai ajahs: the Black Ajah is the secret darkfriend fifth column within the Aes Sedai, with members in all of the seven official ajahs, whereas the Red Ajah, while a legitimate subdivsion within the Aes Sedai with their own official mandate to track down and "gentle" male channelers, tends to produce the largest number of well-intentioned extremists, bigots, and power-mad idealogues (which itself is a part of a recurring theme of the series that where members of different genders don't interact and lean on each other, stagnation and dysfunction soon follow — do with that as you will). Virtually every outright antagonist character among the Aes Sedai is a member of one or both of these two groups.
-   In the _Wizard in Rhyme_ books, the diabolical Sorcerous Overlord of Ibile uses red and black for his colours, symbolizing blood and grief.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Black Beet/Shadowborg from _Juukou B-Fighter_ and the adaptation _Beetleborgs_ is red and black. They are evil clones of The Hero whose arrival makes life for the heroes difficult.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_.
    -   Villain turned Anti-Hero Spike often wears a black Badass Longcoat with a red shirt or scarf underneath. Angelus also uses these two colors. Drusilla is often a Lady in Red but produces this trope because of her black hair.
    -   A different take in "Tough Love". Glory does an Action Dress Rip, tearing off her red dress to reveal a black nightie underneath.
-   Invoked on _Burn Notice_ — when trying to intimidate some Cartel gangsters by playing an enigmatic Louis Cypher figure who can apparently make Stuff Blow Up with a snap of his fingers, Michael dresses in a black suit and shades with blood-red shirt, tie and pocket square.
-   Cole's demon form Belthazor in _Charmed_.
-   _Cowboy Bebop (2021)_ has the Syndicate goons dressed in black suits with red highlights and ties for uniform.
-   _The Defenders (2017)_: The Hand primarily associates with the colors of red and black.
    -   _Daredevil (2015)_. The title character starts wearing these colors in Season 2; he starts off as a Man in Black, then adds red after taking on his 'Devil' appellation.
        -   The Hand's ninjas wear uniforms that are all black, while their masks have red inner lining. In Season 1, when Nobu is tricked by Wilson Fisk into fighting Matt, Nobu wears robes with an inversion of that color scheme (red robes with black inner liner), which might just be ceremonial or reserved for higher-ranking Hand members like Nobu. In _The Defenders_ proper, Elektra's comics-compliant costume is red, and accompanied with a long black coat.
        -   Season 3 of _Daredevil_ provides a non-Hand example with Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter, when he wears a copy of the red-and-black Daredevil armor and commits terrorist attacks for Fisk, first attacking the _New York Bulletin_ to smear Matt's reputation and get rid of Jasper Evans, and later going after Karen at the Clinton Church to avenge the death of James Wesley.
    -   _Iron Fist (2017)_: Despite at first seeming like a peaceful retreat for New York City kids with nowhere else to turn for help, the compound run by Colleen Wing's _sensei_ Bakuto is actually just another faction of the Hand. A sharp-eyed viewer will have picked up the connection long before Danny realizes it by noticing that Bakuto and most of the other students wear red t-shirts, black pants, and black leather jackets.
        -   In Season 2, Davos sports dark black coats (owing to the cold weather) and after he steals the Iron Fist from Danny, and his fists glow red (symbolic of his corrupted chi).
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Sutekh the Destroyer has a red and black color scheme.
    -   The Master:
        -   In the TV Movie, the Master "drezzzes for the occasion" in a red, black, and gold cloak.
        -   Although the Master usually favors all-black, the Gordon Tipple Master's nehru jacket came with red motifs. More recently, the John Simm Master was, in "The Sound of Drums"/"Last of the Time Lords", given a black suit with a black overcoat with red lining, as a nod to the Third Doctor's subversion of this trope.
-   The Filipino fantasy series **Encantadia** has the villainous kingdom of Hathoria clad in black and red regalia and armor.
-   _Farscape_'s Peacekeepers used black and red in their uniforms and décor.
-   _The Flash (2014)_:
    -   The Reverse-Flash may wear a yellow suit, but his gloves and boots are black, his eyes glow red, and he produces red lightning when he runs.
    -   The Rival wears a black suit and he also leaves behind red lightning when he runs. He also has dark orange highlights on the said suit.
    -   Played with in the Season 3 finale. Savitar's dark suit of armor has been glowing blue for the entire season, but it switches to red when Barry takes control of it. Barry beats down Savitar with the suit and is clearly tempted to kill him for all the trouble he put him through, but he relents and destroys the armor.
-   _Game of Thrones_ gives this treatment to the cruel and opportunistic House Bolton, whose colors in the books are pink and red, and their banner a bright red flayed person on a pink field. In the show, the pink is exchanged for black. Y'know, in case people can't pick up the fact that the Boltons are bad from the flayed person.
    -   Even during the "Battle of the Bastards" this is reflected. All the Bolton soldiers wear a black leather armor with a red flayed man on their chests and black helmets with the same thing on it. Ramsay is dressed all-in-black while his second-in-command, Smalljon Umber, all-in-dark red.
    -   Viserys Targaryen is dressed all in black, with a red dragon in the center of his outfit. Admittedly, according to the books, that is how Targaryens often dressed.
    -   Averted with Drogon. He is a dragon with red and black scales but belongs to one of the protagonists. He is, however, the largest and most aggressive of the three.
        -   But ultimately, played straight when Daenerys performs Face–Heel Turn and burns the whole city down on his back.
    -   Cersei Lannister, dons dark red and black dress in the final two episodes she appears in.
-   _Good Omens (2019)_: The red-haired demon Crowley first appears in his serpent form, which is a huge black snake with a red belly. We see in Episode 3 that his human form has been wearing black clothes for centuries, and in the present day, the red collar on his black blazer becomes a minor plot point when Aziraphale turns it tartan. Crowley isn't nearly as evil as some of the other demons, but he is better-dressed.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_:
-   _Kamen Rider_ generally averts this trope as red and black Kamen Riders are usually The Hero who is usually a Nice Guy. Below are examples playing this trope straight:
    -   The Kamen Rider Dark Kiva suit from _Kamen Rider Kiva_ is a black and red version of The Hero's Super Mode. This suit is generally used by King of the Checkmate Four
    -   Both Demushu and Lord Baron from _Kamen Rider Gaim_ sport this color scheme. The first is a Blood Knight, while the latter is the One-Winged Angel form of Kaito who Jumped Off The Slippery Slope.
-   _Knight Rider_: Inverted with the benevolent KITT being a black Trans Am with a red scanner light and a red voice modulator display. Played straight by pure happenstance with KARR’s first appearance in Season 1, as the production simply used one of the other KITT cars to portray him — although a yellow voice modulator display was used for the character. (In KARR’s next appearance, he did have a yellow scanner light to match his voice modulator.) Coincidentally played straight again in the episode “Killer KITT”; wherein KITT is stolen and reprogrammed for nefarious purposes.
-   _The Musketeers_: Cardinal Richelieu exclusively wears either entirely black robes or (for more formal occasions) bright red ones.
-   _Power Rangers_ averts this with several of its red rangers. If they do not wear red and white, they generally wear red and black, but are usually The Hero of the team. Sometimes, The Hero wears red and white but co-exists with a Sixth Ranger who wears red and black. However, several villains do play this trope straight:
    -   _Power Rangers Turbo_: Divatox wears a red and black corset/dress , a red cape and black gloves and boots. Her would-be "husband" from The Movie, Maligore, a lava monster with black rocky skin, red Volcanic Veins and glowing red eyes.
    -   'Power Rangers in Space'': Dark Specter, who looks exactly like Maligore naturally has the same aesthetic. Psycho Red of the Psycho Rangers has black armor and a red helmet.
    -   _Power Rangers Wild Force_: Two examples. The first is Venjix, the leader of the Machine Empire remnants in the Milestone Celebration episode "Forever Red". He is a black and red armored robot, that looks exactly like the aforementioned Black Beet or Shadowborg. There is also the Red Ranger's counterpart among the Shadow Rangers who wears a black ninja bodysuit with red accents on his black helmet.
    -   _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_: All of the main villains have this aesthetic. Mesogog wears black leather and has red bony protrusions on his face which look like eyebrows. The evil Cyborg Zeltrax later gets a One-Winged Angel form which adds red Spikes of Villainy and accents to his black armor. Elsa also wears black leather and has a sword with a red handle and a red sheath. The White Ranger starts out as evil and has a mostly white outfit but with black stripes and a red visor. He later pulls a Heel–Face Turn but his clone also fits as he has the same outfit. There was also a Monster of the Week called the Ruby Dragon who had a red and black design.
    -   _Power Rangers RPM_: In his final form, Venjix the Big Bad of the season, takes the appearance of a large robot in black and gold plating and glowing red eyes. One of his generals, Kilobyte, is a black and red robot with red eyes as well.
-   _Star Trek_
-   _Stranger Things_: The Mind Flayer is often shown with its black form backlit with an ominous red light.
-   _Supernatural_: In "Hammer of the Gods", the goddess Kali wears a red dress and a black skirt. And underneath, a black bra and panties. _Rrrraw!_
-   Both the Locos (Season 1) and the Technos (Season 4) in _The Tribe_ wear red and black.
-   _Super Sentai_: Like _Power Rangers_ mentioned above, several red rangers wear red and black, but are usually The Hero or Sixth Ranger. Villains who do use this aesthetic are:
    -   Abarekiller from _Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger_ combines this trope with White and Red and Eerie All Over, being a black and white striped ranger with a creepy red visor. He stays evil for the majority of the series. Dezumozorlya from manifests itself as a red and black version of the Armor of Darkness, which is the greatest fear of Asuka and his wife Mahoro.
    -   _Engine Sentai Goonger_ has Cleaning Minister Kireizky, who is a black and red robot that destroyed many of the alternate worlds mentioned in the series. While the other villains are slightly comical, he is anything but. The Big Bad of the show, Crime Minister Yogoshimacritein is black and gold with red glowing eyes and is probably the most sadistic character of the show, taking great glee in causing the heroes to suffer while using his henchmen als living shields.
    -   Eras from _Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger_ is the final villain from the show, looking like a red and black demonic being with a white skull as her face. Contrary to most depictions of this trope, Eras isn't irredeemably evil, but a goddes who is a Well-Intentioned Extremist. She created the Ryusoul Tribe, to which the Rangers belong, to uphold the piece on prehistoric earth, buy who gradually gave in to their desire to conquer the planet. To remedy her mistake, she created the Druidon, who were meant to wipe out the Ryusoul Tribe.

    -   Most Ultramen are red and silver, but Ultraman Belial, one of the major Big Bads of the franchise and archenemy of Ultraman Zero, had the silver parts of his body turn black as a result of merging with the Humanoid Abomination Reiblood.
    -   Ultraman Geed is a subversion. His default form is a nasty-looking combination of red, black, and silver due to being Belial's son and directly channelling a share of Belial's power; and the people are suspicious of him due to the resemblance. But Geed ultimately proves himself as genuinely heroic despite his heritage and appearance.
    -   Before Belial, there was Dark Zagi, the Big Bad of _Ultraman Nexus_, complete with soulless red eyes.
-   In _V (1983)_, red and black are the signature colors of the fascistic reptilian Visitors, with almost all their uniforms and even their flag featuring some combination of the two.

    Music 

-   Slovenian art-rockers Laibach love their red and black.
-   Inverted with Steam Powered Giraffe. While their clothing is a red-on-black scheme, they are not evil robots.
-   The Toy Soldier (Doctor Steel's fan club) color scheme, until around 2011, was black with red (and yellow) accents. Somewhat justified, as they are a deliberate parody of evil organizations. (Since the Doctor's retirement, use of red has been diminished.)
-   The PV for the Vocaloid song _Red Shoe Parade_ is animated in a shadow-puppet style, with the parade's red shoes showing clearly.
-   Blue Öyster Cult's album _Tyranny and Mutation_ had its album sides titled "the Red" and "the Black", and the band was known to play with dark themes (and did quite a bit on that particular album as well).
    -   Also (and on the above album), the song "the Red and the Black":
        
        Canadian Mounted baby, police force that works/ red and black, it's their color scheme/ get their man in the end/ ...you kill you maim, you kill you maim
        
-   Pagan/Viking Metal Bands Varg and Turisas use black and red "warpaint" instead of Black Metal's black and white Corpse Paint.
-   Poets of the Fall:
    -   Hamartia, the jester mascot of _Twilight Theater's_ album art<small>◊</small>, wears a typical Harlequin red and black diamond motley, but the flap of his Happy Harlequin Hat terminates in a snake head instead of bells, and he has a nasty Slasher Smile, both of which mark him as a Monster Clown.
    -   Downplayed with Hamartia's reappearance as a jealous, vengeful Orcus on His Throne figure in the video for "Daze," as the motley is replaced by a subtler color scheme in his royal costume, with black hair trimmed with black feathers, black pants, an elaborate red leather jacket, and deep maroon lipstick and face paint, all of which fit with the decadent Masquerade Ball over which he presides.
-   In A Sound Of Thunder's song "The Queen of Hell", the titular Villain Protagonist sings "Red and black our banners wave/ As we march across the land."
-   Blurryface, the character from Twenty One Pilots lore who represents the "dark side" of Tyler Joseph (namely, his insecurities, self-doubt, and struggles with mental illness) dresses in red and black, and his presence is indicated by black paint on Tyler's hands and neck and red eyes. This is also reflected in the color scheme for the _Blurryface_ album (in which the character features prominently).
    -   Another of Blurry's incarnations, the Bishop "Nico" (an elderly man who appears in the videos for "Jumpsuit" and "Nico and the Niners") also sports the color scheme, in the form of a flowing red cloak and black paint on his hands and lower face.
-   British folk punk group The Men They Couldn't Hang invoke this in "The Ghosts of Cable Street", a song about a riot that broke out in 1936 between the British Union of Fascists and the heroic antifascist demonstrators.
    
    This is the British Union with its flag of black and red  
    A flag that casts a shadow in Berlin and in Madrid
    
-   Industrial Bass artist Moris Blak invokes this by having much of his album artwork and on-stage costume (including an Uncanny Valley inducing full-face mask) in blacks and reds. Unsurprising, given that Industrial music revels in evil, oppressive or just plain unsettling imagery.

    Mythology & Religion 

-   Satan, in most of his modern depictions, is usually colored this way. The closest thing to this description in The Bible is a red dragon, which is described as "orange."

    Professional Wrestling 

-   All of Kane's outfits throughout his WWE tenure prominently feature this color combination.
-   The NWO Wolfpack, which was the only difference between them and NWO Hollywood, who still wore the original black and white.
-   Boogeyman, although the fans never booed him, despite the promoter's best efforts.
-   Ojo Diabolico Jr. usually wore black with splashes of red around his gear. His XMW Tag Team partner Ludark Shaitan was Pink black and evil all over.
-   AHII looked the part in All Japan Pro Wrestling, he looks even bonier and spiky than Darth Maul but turned out to be not so bad when he came to the rescue of the local baby faces.
-   Completely averted by Sami Zayn who is the ultimate Nice Guy babyface with these colors. And even as a heel, he wears military green.
-   Finn Bálor is basically this trope except for the evil part. His bodypaint entrance in _WWE NXT_ includes mostly black and red coloration, and maybe the evil thing applies because he's supposed to be channeling a demon.
-   Heidi Lovelace often wore Purple in the independents. She switched to this when WWE turned her into Ruby Riott, leader of The Riott Squad.
-   CHIKARA 2016: The Batiri, two demons (Obariyon and Kodama) and a goblin (Kobald), replaced their usual green-and-black facepaint and gear with this after UltraMantis Black hexed them while possessed by Nazmaldun.
-   Brock Lesnar always wears black gear with crimson accents in his second WWE run.

    Sports 

-   Canadian figure skater Roman Sadovsky wore a blood-red-and-black costume for his short program during the 2017-2018 competitive season (which is set to Peter Gundry's "The Vampire Masquerade") in order to convey to the audience that he was portraying a vampire who attempts to seduce his intended victim with an elegant waltz.
-   AC Milan football team's colours are red and black. The founder Herbert Kilpin said in 1899: "We will be a team of devils. Our colours will be red like fire and black like the fear we will invoke in our opponents".

    Tabletop Games 

-   In the early _BattleTech_ sourcebooks and the early novels, the Draconis Combine was depicted as a brutal and repressive dictatorship, which was solidified by a black-and-red dragon national symbol and parade colors. Toned down in later works, which reworked the Combine from Imperial Japan in space to Feudal Japan In Space with an emphasis on honor. Otherwise averted and zigzagged; heroic Private Military Contractors like the Kell Hounds used neon red and pitch black battlemech paint.
-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_ 5th Edition, Zariel the Fallen Angel is the new Archdevil who rules Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. She wears black armor and has burning red wings and eyes.
-   The Scorpion Clan of _Legend of the Five Rings_ have Card-Carrying Villainy as their hat, so naturally they wear red and black clothing and always wear masks. Being Obviously Evil is their job, and as samurai, they take their duties very seriously.
-   In the Ravnica setting of _Magic: The Gathering_, the Cult of Rakdos relies on red and black mana, and has a Circus of Fear theme throughout.
    -   Interestingly they have none of the grand schemes that the other guilds do. The problem is that their parties turn everyone involved into a Combat Sadomasochist. Survivors are implied to have themselves lobotomized in order to forget what they've done.
    -   The combination of black and red mana in general tends to be dangerous to be around — with black the color of selfishness and red the color of emotion, you tend to get very poor self-control and a remarkable appetite for cruelty. It's not _universal_ — you can sometimes get a black-red character who uses their Red devotion to their loved ones to offset the selfishness of Black — but the major black-red groups in Magic's history have included the bloodthirsty vampires of Innistrad, the Cult of Rakdos, the barbaric minotaurs of Theros, the Mongol-esque Mardu Horde (who offset it with a dash of community-focused white mana, giving them at least in-group compassion), and a fair chunk of two Shards of Alara — the barbaric Jund and the deathly Grixis. Black-red planeswalkers include Sarkhan Vol at his lowest point (he gets better), Nicol Bolas, and — in his duel deck — the theoretically mono-red Tibalt splashes black to represent his fairly overt sadistic tendencies. However, it is inverted in Lorwyn boggarts and Tetsuo Umezawa, two fine examples of Dark Is Not Evil.
-   Both played straight and subverted for two different factions in _Mutant Chronicles_:
    -   Subverted: Red and black are worn by high-ranking Brotherhood Inquisitors. While the Inquisition has done a lot of very shady things, they are ultimately a force for good.
    -   Played straight: the sigil of the Dark Apostle of War, Algeroth (used in promotional materials to symbolize the Dark Legion as a whole), is a red dagger-like cross on a black field, and Algeroth's army leaders, Nepharites, are depicted as hulking red-skinned giants in spiked black armor.
-   Black and red are the official colors of Cheliax in the _Pathfinder_ campaign setting. The nation's current power is based largely on their alliances with hell itself.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_, grimdark universe that it is, absolutely loves this color scheme, and you can expect to find some variation of it in every Codex regardless of the faction's supposed 'goodness'.
    -   Amongst the Space Marines, this is most common amongst the Black Templars and Blood Angels Chapters, usually reserved for their most elite soldiers. The Blood Angels are an odd zigzag of this trope. Regular Blood Angels are a subversion — despite their name and color scheme (red with black accents), and having a lot of vampiric traits within their culture, they are optimistic and care for the Imperial citizens they fight for. However, a flaw in their geneseed, unfortunately, make them _all_ at risk to succumb to the Black Rage. Black Raging Angels are a Double Subversion and wear the reverse of normal Blood Angels colors (black with red accents).
    -   The Tyranids used this color scheme for the entirety of Hive Fleet Behemoth, the first of their many, many such fleets to invade the Milky Way Galaxy.
    -   Similarly, this scheme is a popular one for most Orders Militant of the Sisters of Battle.
    -   Averted by the Farsight Enclaves, which use a burgundy/red-and-black color scheme, as opposed to the beige/orange or similarly neutral coloration of the main T'au army. Despite the coloration, they're certainly no eviler than their kin and are somewhat more egalitarian. In fact, recent lore has painted them as the most outright heroic faction of the T'au, whose mainline philosophy is becoming increasingly Orwellian.
    -   Surprisingly uncommon among the Ax-Crazy and Obviously Evil Chaos Space Marines, as it took until 5th Edition and its emphasis on the newly created Red Corsairs warband for this scheme to show up in canon.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, there's an entire series of monsters called "Dark ——", consisting of Evil Counterparts of existing monsters, and as part of this gimmick they've each undergone an Evil Costume Switch. Guess the predominant colors<small>◊</small> on them now.

    Theatre 

-   Some productions of _Hamlet_ have the title character dressed in red and black. However, despite being a morally ambiguous character, Hamlet (probably) isn't evil.
-   The Tabloid Junkies in _Michael Jackson: ONE_ dress in black and/or red.
-   Subverted in _Twisted_, where Ja'far uses the same colors as Aladdin's Jafar including when he becomes a genie, but is only _thought_ to be evil by the ignorant populace, he's actually the Only Sane Man trying to run the kingdom properly.

    Theme Parks 

-   The nebula ghost in _Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy_ at the Disney Theme Parks is red/orange mixed with the blackness of space.

    Toys 

-   This is the main color scheme of several bad guy _BIONICLE_ sets: Makuta Teridax, Icarax, and Antroz, Kalmah, warrior and elite class Skrall, Sidorak, Vultraz, and Radiak. Subverted with the benevolent Turaga Dume — his set represents the evil Teridax masquerading as him, but the real Dume has these colors too. Interestingly, the Maxilos robot that Teridax's spirit possessed for a while also had these colors...
-   LEGO's other themes were also aware of this trope: The Spyrius faction from _LEGO Space_, Ogel's evil organization from _LEGO Alpha Team_, Vladek and co. from _Knights' Kingdom_ and various other villainous groups from _LEGO Castle_, including witches, a dragon, and the Bat Lord, all had red and black as part of their uniform color schemes. One exception is M-Tron, which flew black-and-red spaceships against black-and-white craft flown by the evil Blacktron II. Both sides used greenish-yellow windshields in the 1991 Lego catalog, so this "glass" did not ensure M-Tron's goodness.
-   The Stone Army in _Ninjago_'s 2013 line follow this trope, in contrast to the Skeleton Army and Nindroids being black and purple.

    Visual Novels 

-   These are the theme colors of _Danganronpa_'s Big Bad Mascot Villain Monokuma, whose body is half-white, half-black with a single red eye. There’s also (by extension) Junko Enoshima, with her strawberry-blonde hair being the only exception, and some white thrown in to better represent her control over Monokuma.
-   Dark Sakura from _Fate/stay night_ wears a black dress with red lines all over due to The Corruption.
    -   Gilgamesh has some red and black on his street clothes (and red eyes), his armor is gold with some black parts and his cloth parts are red; even his sword has black and red.
    -   Saber Alter wears black armor with faint red eyes and a visor with more visible red eyes, again symbolizing The Corruption.
    -   Archer A.K.A Heroic Spirit EMIYA falls into the anti-hero version with his black bodysuit and red semi-coat. At least until _Unlimited Blade Works_ where he betrays the party and tries to kill Shirou.
    -   For its prequel, we have Berserker, who is a Black Knight with a red visor, and any weapon he touches becomes just as black and red as he is. Subverted, as Berserker's true identity is Lancelot, who really just wanted to atone for his sins and figured the best way to do it was to have his king kill him.
    -   Angra Mainyu, aka Avenger, specifically in _Fate/hollow ataraxia_ whenever he’s in control of Shirou; his skin grows dark, he gains black tattoos all over, and his only clothes are red.
-   Madame Scorpion from _Henchman Story_ is a ruthless supervillain who wears a black Spy Catsuit with red trimming, and wields a red Laser Blade.
-   In _Slow Damage_, Towa's mother, Maya, is a Posthumous Character and one of the main factors behind Towa's severe mental and physical trauma. They mostly appear in his nightmares, with the narration focusing on their dark hair and their bright, red lips being the only facial feature that stands out. Further nightmares also make it clear that they usually wore a red-and-black kimono.
-   In _Sunrider_, PACT’s ships and mecha are painted red with black trimming, their officers and leaders wear red-and-black uniforms with gold detailing, and even their emblem<small>◊</small> is red and black, likely to symbolize their communist leanings. Unsurprisingly, they’re the primary antagonists of the series.
-   The nue in _Wizardess Heart_ have huge black kimonos and black fur around their heads, as well as big red jewels on their necklaces. They also appear as black shadows.

    Web Animation 

-   _DSBT InsaniT_: The Darkness counterparts are all black, except for their red eyes.
-   In the hypothetical opening sequence for the concept series _Fuwa Fuwa Foof_, this is invoked in the middle part detailing Foof's criminal past, with black and red being used in the coloration of the backgrounds while most other details are solely colored white (with the ones that aren't being red or black too).
-   The Auditor, the Big Bad of _Madness Combat_, is a pitch-black Living Shadow with glowing red eyes. When he claims Jesus' Holy Halo to wear, it turns dark red as well.
-   _Red vs. Blue_:
    -   The Insurrectionists are a team of black-and-red clad soldiers who oppose Project Freelancer. Subverted, as they're just protecting UNSC property from the Freelancers, who are Obliviously Evil.
    -   Played straight with Sharkface, a former Insurrectionist who returns in Season 13, who has no problem with assisting in the genocide of an entire planet in order to avenge his fallen comrades.
-   _RWBY_: While the main protagonist Ruby is a fun inversion with her borderline-goth outfits contrasting with her kind, idealistic personality, the show’s rouges gallery provides a few straight examples.
    -   The Grimm, one of the first antagonists introduced and a central point of the show’s premise, are a race of shadow monsters with pitch black skin/fur and glowing red eyes and insides. They also sport boney “masks” with luminous red markings forming a unique pattern for each type of Grimm. This extends to the Grimm’s mistress, Salem, who has Black Eyes of Crazy with red pupils and wears black dresses accented by dark red lines.
    -   Adam Taurus is a violent and genocidal leader of the White Fang, who hates all of humanity for oppressing the Faunus and so wants to kill them all. He dresses entirely in red and black, and his hair is vivid red, except for two tufts that appear to be black horns. His sword has a long, red blade and when he uses his power, the entire world around him seems to turn to black silhouettes against a blood-red sky. He invented the white masks the White Fang wear to hide their identities, using the Grimm as inspiration so as to strike fear into the hearts of humans. The leaders of the White Fang, of which he is one, have red designs patterning the masks to make them stand out from the crowd.
    -   Yang’s deadbeat mother Raven Branwen is the leader of a bandit tribe and has black hair, red eyes, and loosely samurai-like outfit that uses red and black colors. That said, she's ultimately more of a Wild Card desperately attempting to stay out of the conflict than actually evil. She used to be on the side of the good guys until she learned that Big Bad Salem has Complete Immortality and is _literally_ impossible to kill. Convinced that Salem could not be beaten and due to Ozpin's habit of lying to people about the conflict, she abandoned the struggle between the sides and returned to the bandit tribe she was part of before attending Beacon Academy for the Hunstman training.

    Webcomics 

-   In contrast to Dragonfly's green, the magic of Great Raven in _Archipelago_ is either simply red, or black with red swirly patterns. This includes magical weapons, magical wings the Raven's servants have, and their trademark red-on-black left eye.
-   Played with in _Bandette_, which is about a Classy Cat-Burglar. Bandette's costume is mostly red and black because she's a criminal, but it's lightened with the primrose-yellow lining of her cape, which shows that she isn't actually evil.
-   Hilariously subverted in _Darths & Droids_, which has the very Obviously Evil Darth Maul turn out to be a private detective working for Palpatine (who is in the side of good here), and he was only fighting the Jedi in self-defense because they thought he was a bounty hunter.
-   The demons from _Deities_ have this color scheme, as well as the setting of Hell.
-   In _Drowtales_, the resident Living Doll Collector, Kharla, seems to like the Red/Black combo.
    -   These are also the colors most often worn by Syphile, Ariel's abusive caretaker.
    -   And Luliane switches to this outfit after the timeskip, because she's been possessed by Khaless, also qualifying this for Evil Costume Switch.
    -   In the last two cases, a more innocuous reason for the colors is because they are the Sarghress clan colors, along with this trope.
-   _EVIL_ is a webcomic about villains, and aside from white, ONLY uses the colors red and black.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Evil Cheerleadra's costume is a red and black Palette Swap of regular Cheerleadra's blue and white outfit.
-   Jagganoth, the seventh Demiurge from _Kill Six Billion Demons_ has deeply ashen skin that looks almost black and red eyes. His Key is also red and he commonly wears red and gold, including a signature red helmet. He is also set up as the Big Bad of the series, featuring most prominently in the final book _Breaker of Infinities_.
-   Mr. Bones, the villain of _Kukuburi_ gleefully adopts this color scheme, contrasting with the Big Good's predominantly blue color scheme.
-   This makes up Dark Star's entire color scheme in _L's Empire_, including their text boxes.
-   The black spirits from _Off-White_ have red eyes and Tron Lines. The evil part is frequently averted, however.
-   _The Order of the Stick_ uses red/black word balloons for several demonic characters, and Redcloak's most distinguishing features are his, well, red cloak and black armor.
-   Played straight and lampshaded in-universe by Umbria/Zaedalkaah from Book 1 of _Our Little Adventure_. When she joined the Souballo Empire later she eventually started wearing their colors, though.
-   _Slightly Damned:_ Pretty much _any_ demon with a red and black color pattern (mostly fire demons) qualifies. Azurai and Dakos, however, take the whole cake and _eat it_, too.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: The Encyclopedia Exposita version of the map of the Known World has full-on Silent World areas, which have fallen to the Plague Zombie monsters, colored in black. The cleansed areas, which were technically reclaimed by some of the few human survivors but are actually closer to buffer zones between the Silent World and settlements, are colored in red.
-   Inverted with _Star Impact_'s Phoebe. Her boxing getup is predominantly black and red, but she's one of the protagonists.
-   Many of _Zoophobia_'s residents of Hell have this color scheme, and also commonly have it as their speech bubble color.
    -   Red and black is technically the theme of Hell (with some exceptions).
    -   Usually subverted in the "evil" aspect of this trope.

    Web Original 

-   The uniforms of Doctor Steel's Army of Toy Soldiers are black with red (and some yellow) accents. (Although since Dr. Steel's retirement, red is still an official color but liberal use of it is discouraged, possibly to avoid their being confused with Nazis.)
-   In _Noob_, the players of the Coalition, the enemy faction to the protagonists, are very prone to wearing red and black according to the webseries and comic. They also happen to be the faction that got saddled with the red cursor while the two other ones got yellow and green.
    -   The novels and _Neogicia_ reveal that these are the official Coalition colors. In addition, the brother and Necessarily Evil Psycho Sidekick of the Empire's leader wears clothes with this combination.
-   _The Noedolekcin Archives_: Kirk takes on a red version of the Nickelodeon Haypile logo, has one black eye, and is a soul-stealing entity responsible for the broadcast hijackings.

    Western Animation 

-   The main colors of the generally antagonistic Fire Nation in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ are red and black.
    -   This color scheme continues to apply to all Fire Nation people, regardless of alignment, in _The Legend of Korra_, but is picked up by the Equalists (who ditch the Fire Nation's gold highlights for touches of industrial gray and stark white). It's subverted when it's used to make Asami Sato seem more insidious than she actually is.
    -   Vaatu, the Dark Spirit, who is the Big Bad of Book 2 and the Greater-Scope Villain of the franchise as a whole, has a variation on this, having a bright orange eye amidst a sea of various shades of dark reds. It's, in fact, a neat inversion<small>◊</small> of the color scheme of Raava, the Light Spirit. Much like the Tso Lan example above, Vaatu also mixes this with Purple Is the New Black when he attacks and gets released from his prison.
    -   The only major antagonist to dress like this in Book 3 is P'Li, the Red Lotus's firebending human cannon. However, in the finale, the Red Lotus mooks wear black and red clothes, which come in two forms: an externally black cloak with red inside (worn by the metalbender that poisoned Korra with mercury), and an Arabic-looking black tunic with a red turban (worn by the guards keeping an eye on the captive airbenders).
-   _Avengers Assemble_ has Iron Skull, Red Skull in a black Iron Man armour with red detailing lines, as well as his eponymous red head.
-   Inverted in _Batman Beyond_, where the Batsuit envelops the wearer _entirely_ and is solid black except for the glider wing lining and the Bat-symbol on the chest, both red. Stolen from an old man in a cave, instead. Since Batman is all about the power of fear, adopting more threatening colors for a Crapsackier Gotham just makes sense. Again, similarly to _Cybersix_, contrasting this is Batman's Arch-Enemy the sickly green Blight.
-   _Ben 10_:
    -   Ben and the Galvans' preferred colors are black, white, and green, so a lot of villains are colored black and red to oppose this as red is the inverse of green on the color wheel. Vilgax and Hex are prime examples. Other antagonists such as Charmcaster, Zs'Skayr, and Eon instead opt for purple due to it being another secondary color.
    -   Albedo's Galvan form has red eyes and black and red clothing. In his first appearance, Ben damages his imitation Omnitrix, causing Albedo's Ben transformation to take on his true form's colors and develop white hair, while all of his other transformations have red eyes. His Ultimatrix is similarly red when he's using it, compared to green when Ben's using it.
    -   Ship, a Galvan Mechamorph, is ordinarily black and green but turns red when he's controlled by the Forever Knights in the _Alien Force_ episode "Pet Project".
    -   Very common in _Omniverse_: Malware, another Mechamorph, starts off half-finished and colored black and yellow, then when he gets upgraded, he turns black and red. Dr. Psychobos' Nemetrix, created to counter each of Ben's aliens, is also black and red. Proctor Servantis combines a black outfit with light red skin, red eyes, and a dark red cranial shell as a result of him being a human-Cerebrocrustacean hybrid. And Maltruant, the show's ultimate villain, is gunmetal gray and red.
    -   In the reboot, Kevin, being a Composite Character of his original self and Albedo, possesses another counterpart to the Omnitrix known as the Antitrix, which is black and red-orange with similar red-eyed transformations.
-   Doc Terror, the Big Bad of _Centurions_, is a Mad Scientist whose Cyborg half is entirely red, while his human half wears a red outfit with black highlights.
-   XANA's primary colors in _Code Lyoko_ are red and black, and is the main villain of the series that Jeremié and his company must kill.
-   Inverted with _Cybersix_, who dresses very prominently in black with a partly red cape, but is the heroine. In the comics the series sprung from, this is explained by her stealing these clothes from a _prostitute_. When it comes to marking who is evil, this series revels in a different trope.
-   Although he only appears in one episode, Negaduck from _Ducktales 2017_ falls into this category. As in tradition with the character, he has his yellow, red, and black costume. However, Negaduck only exists after Jim Starling, Darkwing Duck’s original actor, has gone on a rampage upon learning a Darkwing Duck movie is being made without him as the lead, which almost results in him killing everyone on the set. The color scheme is a result of his costume bleeding out the purple dye, which is probably symbolic of how Starling has lost everything that made him Darkwing Duck. Not that he seems too broken up over it as he happily takes on the role as the grim and gritty villain.
-   In _The Flight of Dragons_, Bryagh (who is The Dragon as well as a literal dragon) is mostly black and red with grey streaks and is extremely bloodthirsty and sadistic. His boss, Ommadon the Red Wizard dresses mostly in various shades of red with no black, but his One-Winged Angel form is a hydra-like beast which shares Bryagh's coloration.
-   The Duke from _Gawayn_ wears an exclusively red and black outfit.
-   _Harley Quinn (2019)_: Harley wears a black and red costume, (both her original costume and the New 52 costume) and is the Villain Protagonist.
-   While there are several demonic members of the _Jackie Chan Adventures_ villain gallery, two of them, Moon Demon Tso Lan (who is part of the second season's Big Bad Duumvirate) and Oni King Tarakudo (who is the Big Bad of the fourth season), play this trope straight with their color schemes when they appear in full form (Tso Lan also mixes this with Purple Is the New Black).
-   Zelda's evil doppelganger in _The Legend of Zelda (1989)_ looked identical to her, save for her top being black with a red vest instead of purple with a white vest.
-   Evil Coop from _Megas XLR_ pilots a black and red mech. Evil Kiva was an Evil Redhead dressed in black.
-   Averted with the heroine of _Miraculous Ladybug_, whose outfit is red with black spots because she's modeled after the ladybug, bringer of good luck. Played straight with her Evil Knockoff Antibug, though, with an inverted color scheme.
-   The mysterious figure seeking "revenge" on Mike Chilton in _Motorcity_. He's given the nickname "Red."
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   King Sombra has this for his color scheme in corporeal form.
    -   And Trixie in "Magic Duel" before The Reveal.
    -   And, of course, Lord Tirek, in "Twilight's Kingdom" has this as his _natural_ coloration. They weren't going for subtle here.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls_:
    -   HIM wears a red lady's jacket and skirt, has red skin and lobster-like claws, wears a black belt and thigh-high boots, has a black beard and hair, and has black lipstick on his lips.
    -   Brick of the Rowdyruff Boys wears a red shirt, red cap and black pants and shoes.
    -   Sedusa has black hair with red-maroon highlights. Her outfit consists of dark red long gloves-mittens and thigh-high boots, leotard, red fishnet stockings, and black pantyhose which she wears under the fishnets.
-   _Primal (2019)_: The horned tyrannosaurs that devour Spear and Fang's respective families in the first episode are bloodred with prominent black stripes. They're also quite sadistic, especially the big one.
-   Inverted in _Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja_. The titular hero's ninja outfit is completely black with dark red streaks (complete with red scarf), yet he's firmly on the side of good.
-   _ReBoot_: Chaotic Evil villain Hexadecimal wears red and black.
-   The _Robot Chicken_'s Evil Counterpart, Darkmeat, is a red rooster with dark grey metal augmentations.
-   Aku from _Samurai Jack_ is mostly colored like this, with a touch of dragonscale green for his mouth, and is quite literally evil all over. In fact, the more of this colorization a character shares the more evil they will be, and having all of these colors likely means they're the big guy himself in disguise.
-   _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_: This appears to be the high-ranking Horde uniform, in contrast to the red and white worn by cadets (and which Adora keeps after she defects) or the plain reddish-purple of officers like Scorpia. Hordak wears a black tabard/dress thing with the red Horde bat-wing symbol, offset with a giant reddish-purple cape, plus has red eyes and fangs. Shadow Weaver dresses entirely in reddish-purple, wreathed in shadow and with long black hair. Catra, in late Season 3, goes for her usual reddish outfit but with a black leather jacket or black void corruption, and shifts in Season 4 to combine reddish-purple with a small black jacket with one long sleeve. Averted with Horde Prime, though, who combines a stark white Ascetic Aesthetic with green accents, including his own eyes and fangs.
-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_: AGIMUS is an evil, megalomaniacal computer with a dark gray casing and blood-red lights.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: The Son is the embodiment of the Dark Side of the Force, and has grey skin, with red paintings on his face, black sclera with red pupils, and his armor is predominantly red and black.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: The Inquisitor is Darth Vader's enforcer in charge of hunting down Jedi fugitives, and is an Expy/Suspiciously Similar Substitute of the Son, with grey skin, red Facial Markings, black armor and a double-bladed red lightsaber.

-   _Teen Titans (2003)_: Trigon the Terrible is the evilest villain on the show and is a gigantic red demon with black stripes on his arms, legs, and torso. Season 3's Big Bad, Brother Blood, normally wears white and gold robes, but the fighting outfit he wears underneath is red and black (with some silver) as is his whole body after he's upgraded himself with cybernetics. And Slade, the Big Bad of the series as a whole, has an iconic red and black mask, as well as an army of black robotic footsoldiers with a red mark at the center of their faces. Red X also has a red and black costume, but is Robin going undercover in his first appearance, and someone who stole the suit and identity in subsequent appearances.
-   _Transformers_: While the franchise usually employs purple to signify evil, there are a few black-and-red villains here and there.
    -   _Transformers: Generation 1_:
        -   The humanoid black-and-red Decepticon Mini-Cassette. Quite who he is varies from each continuity and fan you ask (in the toyline, _The Transformers (Marvel)_, miscellaneous books etc. he is named Rumble, while in the animated series he's Frenzy; refer here for more info).
        -   The condor Decepticon Mini-Cassette, Laserbeak, is consistently black and red.
    -   Knock Out from _Transformers: Prime_ is mostly red, with some black highlights. He's also vain and sadistic. Don't mess with his paint job. He stands out all the more because _Transformers_ usually goes with Red Is Heroic instead.
-   Cad Lackey of _Underdog_ sports a red shirt, plus black pants and shoes.
-   Lord Hater and his mooks from _Wander over Yonder_ are adorned in these colors as well as a bit of yellow.
    -   Lord Dominator and her Mecha-Mooks also use this palette, due to being made out of lava.
-   _Xiaolin Showdown_:
    -   Jack Spicer dresses all in black, with red eyes and hair and red accessories. Of course, there are some doubts about how evil he really is.
    -   Omi briefly becoming evil led to an Evil Costume Switch that turned his robes black with red trim.
