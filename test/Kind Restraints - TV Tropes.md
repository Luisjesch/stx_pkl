In many works, a character can end up being Not Himself. They could even hurt someone, or admit to someone that they are worried that they might hurt someone. Sometimes, they're just acting oddly enough to give people reason to _think_ that they're crazy and/or dangerous to themselves and others. Often, their freedom is taken away by their own friends or allies to keep them safe and unable to harm themselves or other people. This could be by restraint, sedation, or confinement.

This will often happen in a safe location, such as their base or a hospital (or whatever serves as one), and will often result in some fight between the captive and the captor(s). This can result in Breaking the Bonds, or if they gain superpowers it could become a Cardboard Prison. Those keeping them captive may employ some sort of Kryptonite Factor to keep them under control. This could also result in an Unwanted Rescue. If they ask to be restrained, it can overlap with No Matter How Much I Beg.

The character being confined does not need to be willing, and the characters to whom they lose their freedom don't need to be benevolent. However, their confinement has to be for safety, and not for malice or punishment, in order to actually fit this trope.

Subtrope of Cruel to Be Kind. See Percussive Prevention for a more extreme version of this trope.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Played for laughs in _Daphne in the Brilliant Blue_. Gloria is so aggressive and impulsive that her co-workers at Nereids often have to knock her out and/or tie her up to keep her from hurting them, damaging their office, or jeopardizing their missions.
-   _Ulysses 31_: Like in the mythological version of the story, upon sailing toward the sirens, Ulysses orders Nono to tie him up to the mast of their boat before disabling the robot's hearing. Unlike in _The Odyssey_, though, Ulysses manages to break the ropes and jump overboard to be captured by the sirens.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Incredible Hulk_: This happens to the Hulk from time to time. In early stories, Bruce Banner had a bunker under the sea which he had Rick Jones lock him into at night for when he turned into the Hulk.
-   _Spirou & Fantasio_: In the album _La Valllée des Bannis_, a venomous mosquito bites Fantasio and causes him to go insane; the insanity makes Fantasio become very violent and reckless and Spirou is eventually forced to tie him up to keep them both safe.
-   A similar situation happens in the _Achille Talon_ album _Viva Papa!_ To escape from a prison cell while tied up, Talon has sidekick Lefuneste gnaws on their bonds. Except, as they find out, the rope is made of Tapasambalian hemp, a dangerous psychotropic plant. Thus Lefuneste has to be kept tied during the escape. Later, the bad guys capture them again and, seeing one of them still in ropes, conclude that he's no longer their friend and have him freed — and Lefuneste goes berserk on them.
-   On full moon nights, Werewolf by Night is regularly tied down or locked up by family (his sister Lissa), friends (Buck or Morbius) allies (Moon Knight), or even people he's just met but feels he can trust (Bruce Banner). Often it's to little avail as the werewolf is strong enough to break out. Morbius eventually prescribes him drugs that knock him out cold.
-   _All-Star Comics_: The Justice Society of America and their allies restrain the victims of Professor Elba's Insanity Serum to prevent them from harming themselves and others until Dr. Mid-Nite synthesizes Solution K to cure them of the effects.

    Fan Works 

-   Tom gets tied up in many _All Assorted Animorphs AUs_ chapters in order to get him to the Hork-Bajir valley without his Yeerk escaping with his body. Eva also ties Marco to a chair in "What if the yeerks all suddenly died?" (because she thinks he's a controller) and "What if they were all from different AUs á la Into the Spider-Verse?" (because he _is_ a controller).
-   John Gage gets it a few times when he's feverish and delirious in this _Emergency!_ fic series. The problem is, it backfires MAJORLY. As a child, John was abused and sometimes had his hands tied by his uncle, and still suffers a type of PTSD from it. Even under normal circumstances, the idea of being restrained frightens him. But when he's sick or injured, confused and not thinking clearly, the restraints trigger flashbacks and the result is sheer terror and blind panic. He'll scream and cry and fight with everything he has to free himself, usually only responding and calming down when he hears Roy's voice. Brackett sees this the first time he treats him and later stipulates no restraints, ever. But, twice, nurses ignore orders and do it anyway, outraging the doctor, nurse Dixie, and the rest of John's friends.
-   In _Deserted Distractions_, to stop Yami Bakura from causing trouble, Tea ties Ryou to a chair.
-   _Astral Journey: It's Complicated_ has Melanie locked up in a wheelchair and gurney thanks to her escape attempts. The second of which ended in disaster, following being admitted against her will due to her eating disorder that was putting her health in danger.
-   In _What Tomorrow Brings_, the Animorphs knock Tom unconscious and tie him to a chair in the woods so they can kill his Yeerk.

    Films — Animated 

-   _The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad_: In _The Wind in the Willows_, when Toad develops yet another reckless obsession, this one being motorcars, Rat and Mole try to keep him from causing any more damage by locking him in his chambers and standing guard at the door. This plan fails, however, as Toad later escapes out the window via a Bedsheet Ladder.
    
    **Narrator:** Now, of course, playing jailer to one's dearest friend wasn't exactly a pleasant situation. In fact, Moley weakened right at the start and wanted to call it quits. But Ratty said, "No! Definitely not!" This time, they must be firm. After all, it wasn't just a matter of saving Toad from himself. There was MacBadger to consider, and Toad Hall, and all that it stood for.

-   _Grandmother's Farm_: At the end of the movie, Saeed and Mr. Murshid tie up Yasser after he starts convulsint.
-   _The Invisible Man Returns_ (1940) has Geoffrey Radcliffe (Vincent Price) ask a friend and lab colleague to restrain him if he shows signs of insanity (a known side effect of the invisibility formula).

    Literature 

-   Sato in the _13th Reality_ series asks for this when he's infected with the Dark Infinity plague, which transforms him into a raving madman and unwilling host for Reginald Chu's consciousness. He's left tied down in a cell for several days, and by the time the nanobots controlling the plague have been deactivated he's badly injured from struggling against the restraints.
-   _Animorphs_
    -   The team has to tie up Jake when he's accidentally infested, to starve out the Yeerk in his head, and they have to constantly watch him on top of it because they know the Yeerk will try to morph to free him from the restraints. They know for sure the Yeerk's in his head when he refuses to wait out the three days, which he would have done normally (it's not a question of trust, Yeerks being Puppeteer Parasites), also when he calls Ax "Andalite filth".

-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_ novel _The Silver Chair_. The Green Lady's protege asks the protagonists to tie him to the title device and not let him go No Matter How Much I Beg, so that he won't change into a green serpent and kill them. Actually a subversion since he has not yet been revealed to be Prince Rilian and the real reason he is being kept in the Silver Chair is because, rather than being in danger of turning into a snake and killing everyone, those nightly spells are the only times he realizes that he is Prince Rilian and the Green Lady wants to ensure that he doesn't escape from her while he still knows who he is.
-   _Cut_ is about a fifteen-year-old cutter whose family placed her in a mental health facility once they found out that she'd been engaging in Self-Harm.

However, Callie _does_ find ways to engage in Self-Harm despite this...
-   _The Dresden Files_ has examples for both werewolves (with the circle in _Fool Moon_) and (semi) vampires who have trouble controlling their bloodlust (in _Death Masks_).

He does manage to escape, though.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Lincoln from _The 100_ is restrained by the Ark survivors while detoxing from the drug that turned him into a Reaper, and he insists they keep him tied up for a while even after the drug's out of his system because he doesn't trust himself after the things he did while Reaperfied.

    -   In "Somnambulist", Angel fears he may be committing vampire murders while sleepwalking, so has Wesley and Cordelia tie him up while he's asleep. That night there's another murder, proving Angel didn't do it, but by then Angel has worked out that it's a vampire he sired while he was Angelus.
    -   Played for laughs in "Eternity" when his evil Angelus persona resurfaces. At the end of the episode, Angel wakes up Chained to a Bed by Wesley and Cordelia, who inform Angel they don't hold anything Angelus said or did against him. They are in fact willing to move on. And they do...by walking off and leaving him there.
    -   The werewolf Nina comes to Wolfram & Hart monthly to be locked up. Given that she dresses up nicely to do so, Wesley suggests to Angel that she might have another reason.

    -   In the episode "Living Conditions" Buffy starts rooming with a new girl her own age, then starts to get annoyed about those kinds of little things that roomies do to annoy each other. Then she starts to get delusional and claims that the girl is 'evil', and that she's going to have to 'slay' her, which prompts the rest of the Scoobies to tie her up to stop her while trying to find out why she's suddenly gone crazy. The restraints are less than effective at holding her, though Buffy is proven right.

-   In _Firefly_, after one of River's bouts of madness (where she attacks Jayne with a knife) Mal has her confined to her quarters and only allowed out if accompanied by himself or Simon. Unlike most cases, River seems to willingly accept this limitation, as while confined to her room there's no lock or other restraint used. Later in _Serenity_, after a _much_ more destructive round of violence, River is chained up in a locked storeroom, but subsequent events show that she only remained restrained because she knew the rest of the crew were terrified of her and could escape at any time.
-   _Forever_: This is clearly what Nora intended for Henry when she had him taken to the asylum.

    Video Games 

-   In _GHOST Squad_, several segments have you detaining hostages with handcuffs, something that civilians often associate with _arresting a criminal suspect_. But you don't want panicked civilians ("I'm not a terrorist!") just running around potentially disrupting a precision anti-terrorist operation (even if they don't mean to do so), and some of those civilians could actually be enemies in disguise, which is why you have to detain them.

    Web Comics 

-   In _Girl Genius_, the scene in the basement of Castle Heterodyne where Agatha has her minions strap her to an operating table during an experiment which required her to allow an earlier quasi-Demonic Possession to reassert itself.

        **Roy:** I'm going to choose to attribute that comment to stress and not hold it against you in the future.
        
    -   The team also keeps Belkar bound and gagged after Nale uses a Charm Person on him... and for an extra few hours in the morning after the spell wears off since the halfling is better company this way.
    -   An odd _preemptive_ example: when laying an ambush for the Linear Guild, one of the elements is Durkon's Holy Word, a spell that deafens (and paralyzes, if they aren't strong enough) Evil creatures nearby, and banishes outsiders. Naturally this includes Belkar — but this just serves to make him immune to Nale's Suggestion, which he would have to hear to be affected by.

She does have Internet access, which is a rather important consideration given that she is the only known cyberpath in the world.

    Web Videos

    -   It happens again in "Hearts and Hooves Day", where the Cutie Mark Crusaders brew up a love potion in order to get Cheerilee and Big Macintosh together: it backfires dramatically as the two become obsessed with one another, and the only cure is to keep them apart for a whole hour. Sweetie Belle manages to barricade Cheerilee in the dressing room while she picks out her wedding dress; keeping Big Macintosh at bay, however, takes a bit more effort (and a hastily-dug pit trap).
    -   Angel Bunny ties up Fluttershy, _probably_ at her own specific request, and certainly with her consent in "Putting Your Hoof Down" when Fluttershy believes that she is a danger to society.

As it turns out he'd inhaled a drug that affected his nervous system, meaning only he could see Slade and his body reacted to Slade's attacks as if they were real.
    
    **Starfire:** But must we keep him restrained?  
    **Cyborg:** He _threatened us_, Star. He's dangerous.  
    **Beast Boy:** _Dangerous?!_ Try totally flipped-out cuckoo labonza!
    
-   Happens twice to Batman in _Batman: The Animated Series_, both as a result of the Scarecrow's toxins. The first time Bruce inhales a fear-inducing hallucinogen and is confined in Arkham Asylum while suffering various paranoid delusions, unable to convince his caretakers that the Scarecrow's plan is actually real. The second time, a fear-eliminating toxin turns him into a psychopath, and Robin ties him up against his will to protect his enemies.

    **Turbo:** Well, do you feel crazy?  
    **White Shadow:** Uh, no... not really.  
    **Turbo:** Do you wanna tell Chet that we're here?  
    **White Shadow:** A little bit. Also, I love the can.  
    **Turbo:** Right. We're gonna tie you up now, okay?  
    **White Shadow:** Okay.
