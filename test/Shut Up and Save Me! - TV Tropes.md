**Pinkie Pie:** Wheeee! _\[giggles\]_ I knew we'd do it!  
**Daring Do:** Thanks for reminding me to never give up hope, Pinkie.  
**Rainbow Dash:** And I'm kinda "hoping" you ponies will untie me before we all take a bath in bubbling green slime!

Instead of providing rescue to another character, this one is distracted by something. The rescue is Played for Comedy; subverting the Big Damn Heroes by having heroes _not_ awesome during the rescue. They may seem completely oblivious to the danger their friend/ally is in, allowing for a completely different sort of rescue to occur.

This can also be the Inverted Trope of two other rescue tropes; Refuse to Rescue the Disliked (which involves the hero deliberately choosing not to rescue on the basis of personal dislike) and Unwanted Rescue (which involves the character being rescued trying to ignore or prevent the hero's attempts).

For the opposite (where a character would prefer another character _stop_ trying to "save" them), see Unwanted Assistance.

-   In _Monsters, Inc._, Sully is being throttled by Randall when Mike shows up.

And then Mike gets mad and throws a snowball at him, hitting Randall in the face by mistake (showing Sully where Randall's head is).
    
    **Sulley:** _\[is fighting the invisible Randall when he is hit with a snowball\]_ Mike?  
    **Mike:** Look, it's not that I don't care about the kid.  
    **Sulley:** Mike, you don't understand.  
    **Mike:** Yes, I do. I was just mad, that's all. I needed some time to think, but you shouldn't have left me out there.  
    **Sulley:** I'm being attacked!  
    **Mike:** No, I'm not attacking you. I'm trying to be honest. Just hear me out. You and I are a team. Nothing is more important than our friendship. _\[Boo approaches Mike, frightened\]_ I-I-I know, kid. He-he's too sensitive. _\[Sulley is being strangled\]_ Come on, pal. If you start crying, I'm gonna cry, and I'll never get through this. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, but I am now. Hey, Sulley, I am baring my soul here. The least you can do is _pay attention!_ _\[throws snowball; it hits Randall, making him visible enough for Sulley punch him in the face, sending him to the floor\]_ Hey look, it's Randall— _ohhhhhh..._
