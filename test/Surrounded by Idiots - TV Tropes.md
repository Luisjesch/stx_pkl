_"Henchmen. Evil, obedient, bright — pick any two."_

Competent evil help is hard to find. How else can you explain how the Evil Overlord's General is a complete nincompoop, mooks are all dimwits who graduated from the Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy, the elite special forces consist of a Quirky Mini Boss Squad, and all the ninjas are standing around in plain sight or queuing up to attack the heroes one at a time?

Sometimes, it seems like the lead antagonist has deliberately chosen the most incompetent, craven, cowardly, or just plain unreliable underlings around... the trope often culminates in a second-in-command that, instead of being the best of what the lower ranks has to offer, seems to be the living distillation of everything that makes the incompetent underlings what they are. This version is often punctuated by having the right-hand man actually secretly trying to undermine and/or replace the Evil Overlord, but just too incompetent to be a real threat.

Of course, the simplest answer for why the evil master is surrounded by idiots is because you'd _have_ to be stupid to work for him. The underlings' being Too Dumb to Live may well explain why they continue to work for an abusive employer, but we still have to wonder why the Evil Overlord hired them in the first place. We can't pretend he's not aware of his hirelings' shortcomings since he never hesitates to exclaim about them: "FOOLS! CRETINS! BUNGLERS!" (there always seems to be a basic formula of Mild Insult! Not-So-Mild Insult! EXTREME INSULT!, if it's not a case of Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking), sometimes, "It's so hard to find good help these days..." and of course, the oft-repeated Trope Naming line, "I'm surrounded by idiots!" - sometimes accompanied by a facepalm. After one too many failures, the boss tends to say "If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself!" and then proceeds to do far better at any given mission than his underlings have ever done, making you wonder why he didn't just do this in the first place.

Occasionally, one of them will respond to this exclamation by looking around and asking, "Where?"

This trope even made the Evil Overlord List.

Of course, one possible explanation may be that smart minions tend to try to take over... or perhaps any minion might be trying to take over, but a smart one might actually succeed.

When the _boss_ is an incompetent dolt, you have a General Failure or a Pointy-Haired Boss. If _both_ the boss and his minions are morons, then you are dealing with a group of Harmless Villains (such as The Family for the Whole Family).

See also Conservation of Competence and Beleaguered Boss. Polar opposite of it is Surrounded by Smart People. Contrast Too Dumb to Fool. If the character being surrounded by idiots lashes out on them, then it's Enraged by Idiocy.

Here is a compilation with a lot of examples.

## Examples:

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Black Butler_ Sebastian is the head butler, and he has his hands full with keeping the incompetent staff in line. There's a far-sighted maid who breaks dishes and confuses shoe polish with wax, a gardener who destroys everything he touches, a cook who uses flamethrowers, and a guest from India who keeps trying to turn himself in to the police. (As it turns out, this is mostly because the staff was hired on the basis of their competence in very different areas.)
-   In _Mazinger Z_, Dr. Hell often feels like this— _and rightfully so_. When he was younger, it was because he thought he was smarter than anybody, but now it's because his minions are, well, morons. In one episode, he invokes the trope almost word by word: his Co-Dragons have been fighting for the whole episode, even when they're supposed to engage the enemy. He had tried to stop them and force them to cooperate in the beginning, but didn't pan out. So during this particular argument, he (unsuccessfully) tries to ignore them as he has his dinner:
    
    **Dr. Hell:** Why, oh, why is such a genius like myself surrounded by idiots?
    
-   _One Piece_:
    -   While the main protagonists, the Straw Hat Pirates, aren't actually idiots, they do act the part. Zoro and Nami take turns being the Only Sane Man to lampshade the idiocy. Robin has moments of her too, what with her being The Stoic of the group. This is lampshaded during a scene where everyone save for Nami and Vivi are drinking, Vivi worries but Nami calms her down telling her that everyone knows what they have to do if a storm starts.
    -   Captain Kuro has this reaction in regards to his crew. It's not so much that the crew is stupid as it is that he's the smartest man in the East Blue next to Benn Beckman of the Red-Haired Pirates, and looks down on his crew as thugs that are useless without his plans. This is part of why his plan involves having all of them die so that he can maintain the secret of his own death having been faked.
    -   On the side of the Marines, Vice-Admiral Momonga has to deal with a rather impressionable crew that can't keep its act together both when facing a Sea King and meeting the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock, making people wonder why he bothers with them.
    -   Queen reacts with stunned disbelief when he checks in on Kaido's prison labour camp to find out his subordinates have not only let the high-profile prisoner Eustass Kid escape and gotten the master key to the Power Nullifier prisoner handcuffs stolen, but Straw Hat Luffy is literally in the process of escaping _within view_, and they had decided to waste time telling Queen this instead of trying to stop him.
        
        _"WHAAAT?!! GO CATCH HIM, YOU MORONS!!"_
        
-   A rare heroic example comes from the anime _Martian Successor Nadesico_, where Little Miss Snarker Ruri Hoshino frequently says of her crewmates, "baka bakka" — literally, "I'm surrounded by idiots".
    -   It has gotten to the point that many people have used this phrase as the base of "Ruri's Law", a cousin of Sturgeon's Law: "The vast majority of people are idiots".

-   Another hero example: _Orphen_ repeatedly utters this sentence (and variants) in the manga of the same name. You can't really blame him, though, since he _is_ surrounded by nothing but loads and millstones.

-   Not quite a direct example, but _Gakuen Alice_'s Hotaru's various idiot-bashing tools, anyone?
    -   It's straighter than you think. The Idiot Cannon only works on idiots. She uses it in almost every fight scene on almost everyone.
-   In the case of Unsui in _Eyeshield 21_, he was surrounded by perverts. But in the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue, this trope is played straight and he seems to be on the verge of saying this. Also Hiruma and Suzuna usually react like this when a dumber or excited teammate points out an obvious or dumb statement while the other marvels at it.
-   In _Pokémon: The Series_, Giovanni often has to put up with the Team Rocket trio (Jessie, James, and Meowth) and often will comment on their stupidity.
-   _From Eroica with Love_'s Major Klaus Heinz von dem Eberbach feels that this trope is in effect, but in reality his hapless subordinates are actually fairly competent (most of them, anyway), it's just that he has ridiculously high standards.
-   The Second Mizukage of _Naruto_ after being resurrected was incredibly pissed at how none of the shinobi he was fighting would stop attacking the mirages he created and find his actual body.
    -   Sasuke in Part 1, initially felt this towards Naruto and Kakashi.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion_ has an odd take on this. Witch Homura, and later Akuma Homura, intentionally creates the "Clara Doll" minions to represent parts of her personality, with upbeat names like Blockhead, Laziness, and Vanity. She certainly believes herself to be the sum total of these nasty traits, but the accuracy of her self-loathing (one of the minions is Pessimism) is up for debate.
-   In _Brave Exkaiser_, Ptera Geist feels this way about the rest of his teammates. To be fair, he's kinda right, as the other lower-ranked Geisters are Dumb Muscle. Dino Geist feels this way about the entire crew, Ptera Geist included, except his Mouth of Sauron Komori. In fact several episodes _open_ with him roaring in fury and then having Komori chew them out.
-   Lady Une from _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_ when Trowa and Wufei attack Treize's fleet. All her underlings could do is report the Gundams' every moves and couldn't do anything right until Une gave them specific orders.
-   In _Hellsing_, Integra says, "I'm surrounded by Idiots" in one scene.
-   Ajin even had one episode that is literally called "I'm Surrounded By Idiots."
-   As he expresses numerous times, Kazuma of _Konosuba_ feels this way about his lackluster party. His Arch-Priestess is a Goddess with the brainpower of a gnat, his Crusader is a crazy masochist who literally can't hit the broadside of a barn, and his mage is an explosion obsessed Chuunibyou who tires out after casting one spell. He muses quite often that he'd replace all of them if he could.
-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, Chisame and Yue frequently think this about the rest of their class. As the series marches on and the two get to know their classmates better, the latter stops thinking this way, but the former doesn't.

    Comic Books 

-   Doctor Doom has pulled it more than once, as in his eyes, everyone who isn't Doom is an imbecile...
    
    **Doctor Doom:** My greatest flaw. I surround myself with idiots.
    
-   Dr. Light (the hero) was the overly serious member of the late '80s comedic Justice League. She said this a lot.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Lex Luthor's flunkies, in the Golden Age, tended to be dunces and were sometimes played for comic relief. They also might make Heel Face Turns. Otis and Miss Tessmacher are actually quite faithful to this type in the comics.
    -   In _Starfire's Revenge_, as she is being taken into police custody, Supergirl villain Starfire grumbles about her subordinates being cowards, stupid or incompetent.
        
        **Starfire:** I don't know what's happening to criminals today— They're either cowards or too dumb to follow the simplest order!
        
-   Subverted in _Empowered_ where Thugboy and the other self-dubbed Witless Minions pretended to be this to aspiring supervillains so they could fleece their high-tech equipment (and administer some quick, unexpected justice whenever a supervillain tried to cross the Moral Event Horizon). It went pretty well for them for a while, until they made the mistake of trying this on Willy Pete.
-   _Asterix_: General Cantankerus in "Asterix and the Goths" described his troops as "They're all quite thick, and I'm their leader! \[sobs\]"
-   _Iznogoud_: Or, more often than not, by crazies. Special mention to the palace guards. Iznogoud even lampshades this several times:
    
    **Iznogoud:** Can't we just fire all crazy people from this palace?!  
    **Wa'at Alahf:** Sure, boss, but who would be in charge of doing this?
    
-   In the _Superior Spider Man_ run, Otto Octavius (in Peter Parker's body) often considers everyone he ever meets to be an idiot. Then again, he is a genius.
-   In a _Justice League of America_ issue detailing a potential universe where Darkseid won, Batman taunted him by answering his question of why he was "surrounded by maggots" - after winning, he'd done what he always said he would do: reform creation in his image. Thus, he has no room to complain: all he's seeing is his own ugly mug.
-   Done interestingly in _Wayward_ where the Big Bad, a Visionary Villain intent on bridging the gap between the past and the future, not only finds himself frustrated by his conservative team mates' idiotic insistence to much rather fight to the last man instead of accepting the changing times and embracing the future and its technological wonders, but finds himself equally frustrated by the heroes' idiotic lack of respect for the introspective virtues of the past and stubborn teenage mentality to just follow the whims of their flailing emotions.
-   In issue 2 of _Flash Gordon (1988)_ Flash points out Ming's guards are incompetent. It takes two panels for Ming to come to the same conclusion and try to kill Flash himself.
-   _The Punisher: Welcome Back, Frank_ has Ma Gnucci, who no doubt believes herself to be the only sensible person left in the family after Frank's rampage. Frank also earlier threw her to a polar bear, which she somehow survived, minus her limbs. She attempts to have her vengance but is off to a slow start thanks to her remaining goons being Literal-Minded morons.
    
    **Ma Gnucci:** Spread the word: **vendetta**. I am putting _ten million dollars_ on the head of the _animal_ that did this to me.  
    **Mook:** ...You want us to put a hit on the bear?  
    **Ma Gnucci:** (_visibly pained at the display of idiocy_) On the _Punisher_...
    

    Comic Strips 

-   This is Sheila's reaction on discovering who her final teammates are during the "Grudge Match" arc in _Knights of the Dinner Table_. Following the elimination games, one member of each of the gaming groups is supposed to belly up to the table for the final showdown. Sheila expects to be backed up by the power players from the other 'evil' groups: the other players being supposed to take the fall to allow them to progress. Instead she ends up with the most useless character from every team.
-   _Dilbert_:
    -   One strip had the Pointy-Haired Boss complaining that he was "surrounded by incompetents", and Dilbert's reply was "If a bunch of incompetents were able to surround you, what does that say about you?"
    -   At the end of a business meeting facilitated by Dogbert at Dilbert's request, Dogbert says that his takeaway was the realization that he was the only one there with anything to say, and requests "a moment of silence to honor me for my brilliant work despite being surrounded by dolts." Alice and Wally, seated on either side of him, are scowling.
-   In this strip from _Barney & Clyde_, Pillsbury Pharmaceuticals' Sarcasm-Blind R&D team makes pill bottles more difficult to open in response to Barney's "Could we make it more difficult to open?" Barney declares himself surrounded by idiots, who then say, "We prefer 'savants.'"

    Fan Works 

-   _Evangelion 303_: Asuka often thinks that all in the base but her — and some few people such like Shinji, Hikari or Jessika — are idiots or weirdoes. In the chapter 15, as she is putting up with the Mari and Kelly's antics, she thinks: "Idiots. Idiots both of them..."
-   Rupert and Earl, an original creation by fanfic author Swing123, are commanders of an exceptionally idiotic crew who appear in _Calvin and Hobbes: The Movie_ (the original had the crew portrayed as very competent, but the remake makes them the idiots they are later on), have a cameo in _Calvin and Hobbes II: Lost at Sea_, and return in _Calvin and Hobbes III: Double Trouble_ and _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_.
-   _Child of the Storm_ has Jean-Paul flatly say this almost word for word in the finale of Book 1, when his friends are casually chatting in the midst of a brutal battle. This is less because of their stupidity (they're all pretty smart), per se, more a complete lack of common sense.
-   _Tamers Forever Series_:
    -   Ruki tends to show aspects of this when Chaos and Takato do something moronic (which is pretty much all the time).
        
        **Oh I can't believe you two**
        
    -   Takato also acts like this when confronted by Ruki and Chaos's nigh constant bickering.
        
        _"Sometimes I wish my mind showed me something **other** than the two of you"_
        
-   Harry feels this way in _The Havoc Side of the Force_ after one of the slaves he freed loudly confirms his identity in a throne room filled with people. He even tells HK-47 to ask them, in the most insulting manner he can, "Whether the words 'I'd like to remain anonymous' are anything more than a collection of unintelligible syllables to them, or they actually want me dead, or if they are all just sodding morons." As he points out, when he saved the slaves (and robbed their owner, a Hutt, blind), he made sure no one could possibly trace it back to him. Now because of a little girl, he's going to be hunted by the Hutts for what he did. This is deconstructed when it exacerbates Harry's (somewhat justified) paranoia to the point that until he meets Death Watch and gets himself some decent security, Harry is _obsessed_ with doing as much of his own security checks himself as he can humanly manage. To start with, he descends into incandescent rage when he learns the "little girl" above was actually Padawan Aayla Secura, who in her haste to contact her Master gave the Hutts a solid bead on Harry, who only managed to escape by the skin of his teeth. _Then_, despite asking Amidala to keep his involvement discreet, the bounty hunters pursuing him arrived to his destination _before him_ (unknown to him, it's actually not Amidala's fault - she gave Palpatine a few details and begged him to keep the info a state secret, and he immediately leaked the info).
-   In chapter 3 of _A Necromancer's Wild Card_, a _Persona 3_ and _Is This A Zombie?_ crossover, Minato Arisato provides a heroic example as he quotes this trope verbatim after witnessing the students of Ayumu Aikawa's school paying more attention to Ayumu crossdressing instead of a **giant crawfish monster** that Ayumu recently killed.
    
    **Minato** (thinking to himself while also facepalming): _'Hide your shame, Ayumu. Hide your shame because I'm evidently surrounded by idiots.'_
    
-   In _Advice and Trust_, Ritsuko's got this mindset. During Unit-00's activation test, she thinks that everyone else is stupid.
-   _Read the Fine Print (Evangelion)_: In her first letter to Shinji, Asuka complains that she is the only member of the Nerv's German branch who is not a blithering idiot.
-   In _Shinji and Warhammer40k_ Kaworu bemoans his lack of competent henchmen. The trope is then deconstructed as he admits that he's not surrounded by _idiots_, he's surrounded by the _mediocre_. SEELE and NERV recruited the best henchmen while the Earth Cradle was essentially a dumping ground for the leftovers. As a result he got people who are less skilled and less _sane_ than canon Evangelion characters.
-   At one point in _Back To Us_, Alya learns from Adrien that the other members of Team Miraculous (who she learned the identities of in a previous chapter) don't know who he is under the mask and he doesn't know who they are. She then facepalms at realizing just how stupid he, Marinette, and Nino are.
-   In a heroic example, the four VERY MUCH feel this way in _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_. At one point John asks in frustration, "Are we absolutely the only ones usin' our brains round here?" And later, when they're meeting with the Circle leadership:
    
    John, who had thought his observation perfectly reasonable and no insight of any great brilliance, was almost as astonished as the Circle people by their reaction to it. Remembering his conversation with George and Paul some nights ago, particularly his comment that no one seemed to be using their brains except them, he could only conclude that he was one hundred percent right and that _every other person on C'hou was a fucking idiot. Including_ the gods. He quickly picked up his wine cup again and drank deeply so he wouldn't burst out laughing.
    
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   Poor Vegeta.
    -   And then there's Nappa...
        
        **Nappa:** What's wrong Vegeta?  
        **Vegeta:** I'm just... having an aneurysm from sheer stupidity.  
        **Nappa:** I didn't know you were that stupid, Vegeta.  
        **Vegeta:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
        
    -   And then there's Garlic Jr. in _The Dead Zone Abridged_.
        
        **Garlic:** Oh God, your father's Goku... _Oh my God you morons stole Goku's kid?!_ How? How did you steal Goku's kid?!  
        **Cinnamon:** Well first we beat up his wife.  
        **Garlic:** _Oh my shit!_
        

-   _Sword Art Online Abridged_ has constant lamentation from named male characters to the outright stupidity of the rest of the player base. Kirito constantly has to remind his female companions (not named Asuna, thankfully) how aggro works, Diabel loses his temper when some of his fellow players break from the game during a boss fight to play _Bejeweled_ of all things, Keita vociferously regrets surrounding himself with quest NPCs, Tiffany goes from trying to help his fellow players to scamming them when he realizes just how stupid they are, and Kayaba's last vestiges of faith in humanity are sorely tested when one player attacks him _after Kirito triggered the "Immortal Object" notice after attacking Kayaba himself_.
    
    **Kayaba:** I _tried_, you know. _Lord knows_ I've tried. But there's just no helping you people! It's like you crave death, but not just _any_ death, nooooo! You fuckers seem to have some sort of pool going to see who can end their existence in the dumbest, most avoidable way possible! _And you just keep one-upping each other!_ Do you know how many of you have died screaming "Leeroy Jenkins"? _More than zero!_
    
-   _Major League Pony_: Nightmare Moon states this to herself, as Twilight is running down a completely ridicules and nonsensical list of element names for her friends.
-   In _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fic, _Sunspawned_, Princess Celestia discusses her dissolute court in this way with the newly cloned Sunset Shimmer and her creator, Sunburst:
    
    **Celestia:** I put on a disguise so I can socialize without being a 'princess'.  
    **Sunset:** What? But—you have a wealth of knowledge and power and, and wealth!  
    **Celestia:** I'm also surrounded by self-absorbed idiots and nopony respects me for myself.  
    **Sunset:** (To Sunburst) Congrats, you're a princess.
    
-   _Rules_: The reason why Light wants to stay in America for the summer is because this is his situation in Japan (with Misa being the most foremost example). When he was back home for Christmas, he desperately missed the intelligent company of Elijah and, to a lesser extent, Ethan, and has no desire to repeat the experience.
-   A rare inversion occurs in a side story of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_. Zevie, the leader of Team Zenith (from which Teams Magma and Aqua split from) admits to Steven Stone that his plans failed partly because he surrounded himself with too many _bright_ people since their ideas to change the world clashed with each other and led to a lot of infighting.
-   In _Invader Franny_, a crossover fic between _Invader Zim_ and _Franny K. Stein_, Franny dismisses everyone at Skool aside from Dib as being "bloody idiots".
-   In _Rising of the Sleeping Soldier_, while Alucard is the second oldest of the cardinal heroes (himself being 19 and Motoyasu being 21), he is the most mature out of all of them and quickly starts to feel like the only adult among them due to their collective tendency to act like they're the smartest one in the room when the facts point the other way.
-   At the climax of _Shazam!_ story _Here There Be Monsters_, Dr. Sivana grumbles that his subordinates are unable to think for themselves or do anything without his input.
    
    **Dr. Sivana:** "Illyria! Increase the power of the paralysis ray!"  
    **Illyria:** "How do I do that?"  
    **Dr. Sivana:** "How do I know? Get another rat to run in the generator! You all expect me to do your thinking for you!"
    
-   _Morality Chain (Avatar: The Last Airbender)_: Azula is very, very rarely impressed with anyone in the Fire Nation besides Ty Lee and Mai. And the main exceptions are Zuko and Iroh.
    -   Most of the Fire Nation generals are incompetent idiots. This is apparently partly due to Lowered Recruiting Standards; with the imminent return of Sozin's Comet, they won't actually need competent people in charge soon, since all resistance will be completely shattered.
    -   The soldiers who accompany her on the way to the Earth Kingdom are supposed to be elites, but she considers their Firebending forms atrocious. On the plus side, her primary way of dealing with this is forcing them to train with her—while it's not _fun_ for them to be used as punching bags, they do know they learn from the experience.
    -   She facepalms when she finds out that Mai's parents allowed an evacuation due to a suspicious plague in a city that was already known to have a resistance movement. She's also annoyed that they've agreed to trade the extremely valuable King Bumi for the return of their kidnapped infant son Tom-Tom, but she can understand capitulating... until she finds out that offering Bumi was _their_ idea.
-   _Zim the Warlord: Irken Reversion_: This is why Gaz hates humanity more than she dislikes Zim. Humans are dumb, and so is Zim, but only a handful of humans know what Zim really is, one of them being her brother who's stupid pretty much everywhere else. Zim at least is pretty clever when he stops to actually think things through, which happens quite a bit more often after he undergoes Reversion.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Aladdin_: Captain of the palace guards, Razoul feels this way towards his underlings, who cower in fear upon seeing a little monkey who barely reaches their knees holding a scimitar.
    
    **Guard:** _(horrified to see Abu holding a sword)_ He's got a sword!  
    **Razoul:** _(angrily)_ Oh, you idiots... _(unsheathes his sword)_ WE'VE ALL GOT SWORDS!!
    
-   Twice in _All Dogs Go to Heaven_, the villain Carface shouts, "_Morons!_ I'm surrounded by _morons!_"
-   An interesting variation in _Despicable Me_. While Gru doesn't find the antics of the Minions annoying (at least not to the point where he berates them loudly and viciously), they do have a tendency to aggravate _each other_.
-   In their first appearance in _Hercules_, Hades' minions, Pain and Panic, can't even go down the stairs without slapstick stuff happening to them. Which prompts Hades to glance at the audience with a "I don't get paid enough for this" look.
-   In Disney's _The Lion King_, Scar says this exact quote about the hyenas. Interestingly, he said this about said hyenas playing their species's trope straight, and not the mission they had recently failed.
    
    **Scar:** _\[facepalm\]_ I'm _surrounded_ by idiots...
    
-   In _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks_, Adagio Dazzle feels this way about her Co-Dragons, Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze. She has this to say to Sunset Shimmer during her initial tour of the school:
    
    **Adagio Dazzle:** _\[insincere smile\]_ You'll have to excuse them. _\[contemptuous frown\]_ They're idiots.
    
-   The novelization of _My Little Pony: The Movie (2017)_ provides some additional insight into Tempest Shadow's mental state: "'Well, answer it!' Tempest barked. Sometimes she couldn't help feeling as though she was surrounded by incompetent oafs. They couldn't even accomplish the simplest tasks, like answering a potion call."
-   _Quest for Camelot_: Ruber towards some of his dim-witted henchmen and mostly his Griffin. The annoyed expression on Ruber's face gives it away at times.
-   The Bog King from _Strange Magic_. He's the king of the goblins who routinely fail him at basic tasks like informing him of trespassers or stopping said lone trespasser from breaking into his palace.
-   In _Sleeping Beauty_, Maleficent had been sending her minions to search for Princess Aurora, whom she cast a curse on as a newborn, to put her plan into motion. However, said minions failed in looking for her for 16 years because they thought too much about the "newborn" part. Maleficent is not too keen on finding out...
    -   In the live-action retelling _Maleficent_, this is actually the point where it clearly deviates from the original story: This time she sends her only competent underling, the raven Diablo (renamed Diaval), out _first_, and the changes cascade from there.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _101 Dalmatians (1996)_
    
    **Cruella:** Congratulations. You three have just won the Gold, Silver, and Bronze in the Morons Olympics!  
    **Horace:** Who won the gold?  
    **Cruella:** SHUT UP!
    
-   _Austin Powers_:
    -   Doctor Evil, of course, supplies us with this quote:
        
        **Doctor Evil:** Why must I constantly be surrounded by frickin' idiots?
        
    -   Used in the trailer for _Goldmember_ as well, by the narrator.
        
        _He is brilliant. He is deadly. And he is still surrounded by frickin' idiots._
        
    -   Of course he's not too smart himself... Number Two and Scott fit this more.
-   In BEACH PARTY (Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon), the world's least scary motorcycle gang leader, Eric von Zipper, declares toward the end of the film that he has "an army of stupids." Not that he has much room to talk.
-   In _Becket_, when Henry II sends some loyal members of his court to arrest the Turbulent Priest, Becket not only refuses to plead to the charges but manages to turn the tables on his accusers by reminding them that he's their spiritual father and threatening their souls if they arrest him on false accusations. Henry II, watching this turn of events from afar, breaks down laughing and says in amazement, "He's made mincemeat of them. I'm surrounded by fools! Becket is the only intelligent man in my kingdom and he's against me."
-   In _Bickford Schmeckler's Cool Ideas_, the eponymous character gives what may be one of the best diss lines ever:
    
    **Bickford:** I'm surrounded by soon-to-be Deltas of the Brave New World.
    
-   _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid_. As Butch, Sundance, and their employer are on a mission to pick up a payroll, Butch and Sundance are watching for an ambush. The employer says "Morons. I've got morons on my team.", and explains that no one will ambush them because they don't have the money yet.
-   _Blazing Saddles_: Outside of Bart, the Waco Kid and Hedley Lamarr, neither side is exactly overburdened with brain cells. Hedley describes his chief minion as a "shitkicker" at least once, and one of the film's funniest lines is Gene Wilder ad-libbing a reminder for Bart that the people of Rock Ridge aren't that bright either.
    
    **Jim:** You've got to remember that these are simple farmers. People of the land. The common clay of the New West. You know. Morons.  
    **Bart:** \[Corpsing\]
    
-   _Desperado_: A significant source of the film's comedy is Big Bad Bucho's increasing (and eventually murderous) rage at having a bunch of Stupid Crooks as minions who are constantly getting killed and making him look bad in front of his fellow Cartel leaders.
-   _Get Shorty_. Very few people not named Chili Palmer consider the consequences of their actions or the possibility that they might not be as smart/sneaky/powerful as they think they are.
-   In _The Gods Must Be Crazy_, Amoral Afrikaner Sam Boga says this of his men when they meet up with him at the banana forest in Dumgaze after a botched Assassination Attempt on the president:
    
    **Sam Boga:** You killed three, and injured five. And you lost four. Why do I have to work with AMATEURS?!
    
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_: Spend enough time with the Guardians of the Galaxy, and one will inevitably have this reaction.
    -   In _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_, during the Kyln prison break, an exasperated Gamora comes to this conclusion on her future teammates.
        
        **Gamora:** I am going to die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.
        
    -   In _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_, Nebula's general attitude towards the Dysfunction Junction that is the Guardians of Galaxy is that they're all morons who are completely out of their minds.
        
        **Nebula:** Idiots!!
        
    -   In _Avengers: Infinity War_, Tony Stark, Peter Parker and Stephen Strange wind up teaming up with the Guardians (minus Gamora, Rocket and Groot). Tony quickly becomes annoyed when the Guardians refuse to listen to any of his plans, and when Peter finally asks what it is they can do, Mantis tells him they "kick names and take ass". Cue a long Beat where Tony looks like he's seriously reconsidering every single one of his life choices, while Peter looks at Tony with a "well, now what do we do?" look on his face.
    -   Thanos is subject to this a lot; whomever he hires fails to deliver the Infinity Stones to him. After Ronan the Accuser betrayed him _and_ purposely failed to deliver the Power Stone to him, this lead Thanos in _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ to decide enough is enough and that he will get the stones himself.
-   In the 1993 film _Hocus Pocus_:
    
    **Winifred:** WHY? Why was I cursed with such IDIOT sisters?  
    **Sarah:** Just lucky, I guess
    
-   In the film adaptation of _Holes_, after 4 days of digging in the same wrong spot in order to find Kate Barlow's loot, the Warden starts to lose her patience with the diggers and both Mr. Sir and Mr. Pendanski's incompetence, leaving the scene while uttering:
    
    **Warden:** I'm surrounded by Cow Turds.
    
-   _The Hunger Games_: President Coriolanus Snow takes this attitude towards Seneca Crane during their scenes in the movie. In general, he seems to dislike the hypocrisy of the system he runs, or at least get tired of it, and enjoys the company of those, like Plutarch and Katniss, who share his cynicism.
-   In _The Illusionist (2006)_, the Crown Prince says that he's surrounded by incompetents and that he can't stand for it. So he doesn't.
-   _Labyrinth_: Jareth the Goblin King actually has to tell his goblin minions to laugh when he tells a joke and is seen at one point facepalming in the middle of his throne room. You get the feeling that he wants Sarah to stay with him because he's probably desperate for a conversation with someone with an IQ above one digit.
-   _Lawrence of Arabia_. After attempting to discuss the uniqueness of Lawrence's face with his minions, they simply don't get what he's talking about. The Turkish Bey laments to Lawrence that he's "surrounded by cattle. If I \[he\] were posted to the dark side of the moon, I \[he\] could not be more isolated."
-   The opinionated general in _Mars Attacks!_ seems to think he's the Only Sane Man in the White House.
-   Mr. Vandegelder seems to believe this in _The Matchmaker_, as he states directly to the audience "Ninety-nine percent of the world is populated by fools. And the few that aren't are in grave danger of being overcome by them". Dolly apparently believes it to be the case as well, to a degree, though she feels it's equally foolish to try to separate one's self from them ("A fool among fools, or a fool alone?").
-   In _Merlin_, Vortigern wonders aloud "Why is it that I surround myself with a bunch of incompetent fools?"
    -   This is the same guy who prides himself on acting before thinking, which is precisely what causes his downfall (pun intended).
        -   Though he discusses it in a remarkably thoughtful way and points out that it has worked for him so far. Apparently the trick is to act before the other guy is done thinking.
-   There's a non-villainous version in _Paint Your Wagon_, with the missionary expressing disgust at the inhabitants of No-Name City. ("Boozers! Gluttons! Gamblers! Harlots! FORNICATORS!") But his insults fall on deaf ears, partly because the townspeople are proud of their degeneracy and partly because they don't know what a "fornicator" is.
-   In _Posse (1975)_, Strawhorn complain to Peppe that he asked him to get him a gang, but instead Peppe has provided him with a bunch of 'cucarachas' (cockroaches). He is proved right when Peppe's men are immediately cut down by Nightingale's posse after opening fire (against Strawhorn's explicit orders) when the posse were still out of range.
-   In the New Zealand road movie, _Snakeskin_, the leader of the skinheads proclaims,
    
    **Speed:** Terry your brother is a fucking idiot. You're a fuckin' idiot too, I'M SURROUNDED BY FUCKING IDIOTS!
    
-   In _Robin Hood: Men in Tights_, Robin - the _hero_ - comes to this conclusion when he is presented with his new recruits. The ensuing training montage does little to disprove it, to the point where he seriously considers sending the training dummies into battle instead.
    
    **Little John:** I sent word to every village in England. They've sent their best men.  
    **Robin:** We are in a lot of trouble.
    
-   _Rogue One_ Imperial science officer Orson Krennic winds up on Scarif for the climax of the film. Given that Scarif is essentially a beach planet (at least the parts we see of it), it might be the Imperial equivalent of a cushy beach assignment. So, when Rebels attack the data vault there and the command crew reacts with only stunned silence, Krennic is understandably frustrated.
    
    **Krennic:** Are we _blind_? DEPLOY THE GARRISON!!
    
-   In _Spaceballs_, almost everyone working on the bridge of _Spaceball One_ is an asshole. At least, they have the surname Asshole.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    **Dark Helmet:** How many Assholes we got on this ship anyhow?  
    _\[all except one crewmember on the bridge jump to their feet\]_  
    **Standing Crew: Yo!**  
    _\[Beat as Dark Helmet turns slowly around, pauses momentarily upon seeing the number of Assholes, then continues turning to face Colonel Sandurz\]_  
    **Dark Helmet:** ...I knew it, I'm surrounded by Assholes.  
    _\[another Beat before Dark Helmet quickly slams his faceplate down\]_  
    **Dark Helmet:** _\[in his deep voice\]_ Keep firing, Assholes!
    
-   Elijah Kalgan wants you to know that his _Space Mutiny_ is being undermined by his own disciples. His words, not ours.
-   Justified in _The Spirit_ as the Mad Scientist villain can create cloned (e.g. expendable) henchmen, but not cloned henchmen who are smart. One attempt to do so creates a bouncing foot...man...thing. Which is just plain damn weird.
-   In _Superman: The Movie_ (1978) and _Superman II_ (1980), Lex Luthor had Otis. "It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to keep those legs moving."
-   Possibly originated, certainly codified by _The Three Stooges_. "I'm surrounded by morons!" could have been Moe's catchphrase if he hadn't had so many of them...
-   Evil, the Big Bad in Terry Gilliam's _Time Bandits_, is surrounded by incompetent henchmen. At one point, he says to one of them who's just said something particularly idiotic, "Oh, my dear Benson, you are so mercifully free of the ravages of intelligence." This is likely his own doing, however, as both of the mooks who dare to raise serious questions about Evil's plan are blown to smithereens.

    Literature 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Victor from _Portal Through Time_ is a committed and serious villain who is exasperated by how most of his allies in trying to disrupt the Slayer timeline are arrogant, lazy, dim-witted, or some combination of the three.
-   Terry Pratchett likes this one.
    -   Evil Harry Dread in the Discworld book _The Last Hero_ deliberately chooses his underlings for their stupidity, and they quickly kill themselves in battle. He's a traditionalist: "if I surround myself with morons, as I'm supposed to, then the hero will let me get away, like he's supposed to." It's just Terry Pratchett's usual method of taking things to the breaking point to make a joke.
    -   Carcer in _Night Watch_, especially after he becomes Captain of the Palace Guard. This is somewhat justified, in that "\[Carcer's men\] hated Keel with that gnawing, nerve-sapping hatred that only the mediocre can really bring to bear, and that was useful."
    -   Exactly the same joke/point is made in _Guards! Guards!_, an earlier Discworld novel which also stars Vimes, with the Elucidated Brethren of the Ebon Night.
-   Ignatius Reilly, the protagonist of _A Confederacy of Dunces_, views his fellow citizens of New Orleans as such. Inverted to a degree, in that Ignatius himself is very foolish and has some serious Mommy Issues.
-   Pavel Kazakov, Big Bad of the Dale Brown novel _Warrior Class_, says "I'm surrounded by cowards and incompetents" after Tin Men take over one of his oil tankers.
-   _Redwall's_ Cluny the Scourge muses on this trope while considering the intelligence of his commanders. Only Redtooth, Killconey, Darkclaw, and Shadow could be called smart by any real measures, while the rest are just brutes (such as Frogblood), expendable idiots (Fangburn and Ragear), or are far too overconfident in their limited abilities (Cheesethief). He decides that putting up with stupidity from his followers is worth the utter obedience he gets because they're too dim to think for themselves.
-   _Animorphs_:
    -   Visser Three has an instant solution to any idiots around him - and it's not pretty. Thing is, though, he's not very tolerant of any failure and is prone to executing his subordinates for anything from letting the Animorphs escape to reminding him that bugs exist.
    -   In _The Return_, Sixth Ranger Traitor David recruits a pair of thugs to do his dirty work, seeing as how he's now trapped in rat morph. They're not very bright, though, and David laments their idiocy several times. Eventually, they even end up turning on him.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Cersei laments this, unaware that the reason is she's driven away or ignored everyone with good advice.
    -   Aside from Melisandre and Davos, Stannis feels he is surrounded by mostly bootlickers and fanatics.
-   In _Winnie-the-Pooh_, this was A.A. Milne's explanation for why Eeyore is depressed.
-   In the _Rainbow Magic_ series, Jack Frost often complains about this. It backfires on him in the movie, where he gets smarter henchmen... who betray him.
-   In _Harry Potter_ Severus Snape, the Potions teacher, repeatedly laments that very few, if any, of his students are up to his standards of intellect. To their faces. It becomes a vicious cycle, because the environment of constant ridicule and deprecation without any kind of aid or approval from the teacher does not lend itself to productive education, thus causing children to make mistakes and earn even more insults. In some cases, Neville Longbottom in particular, fear of him makes students so nervous that they're simply so stupefied with terror that they can't do their work properly, thus earning his wrath.
    -   Harry feels this way towards the Ministry of Magic for not accepting Voldemort's return sooner as well as not punishing Umbridge for her actions at Hogwarts. He has good reason to feel that way. He also feels this mixed with Only Sane Man in the sixth book during Ron and Hermione's Operation: Jealousy.
-   Despite being quite prone to Stupid Evil himself, Darth Sidious complains of this in the _Star Wars Legends_ novella _Book of Sith_. Despite being the one who personally issued Order 66, he was sick of Vader going out of his way to hunt down random Jedi instead of helping him manage the Empire even after being ordered to knock it off _twice_, so he created the Inquisitorius to help satisfy his bloodlust. However, the Inquisitors were Incompletely Trained by Vader and laughably incompetent as a result, with Palpatine complaining in the book about three of them getting killed through mundane means such as a bomb, speeder crash, and drowning, and ranting that they're making a mockery of The Empire.
-   In _The White Rose_, the third book of _The Black Company_ series by Glen Cook, published in 1985, near the end of the book exactly this occurs: "Idiots" the Lady murmured. "I'm surrounded by idiots. Even the Tree is a dolt".
-   As _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_ progresses, Greg becomes much more aware of this. In _Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Old School_ during the camping trip, he's the only sane person in the cabin, and helpless to prevent his cabin-mates' stupidity. In fact, when Greg separates from the group it all goes wrong for them.
-   Artemis Fowl often feels this way about all of the other main characters (except Foaly, who is a genius) throughout the entire series. To be fair to his friends and teammates, almost all of them are quite competent in their own right, but Artemis is still equal parts exasperated/amused at their lack of understanding of his jokes/references/plans. It's tough to be an evil genius!
-   _Edgedancer_ (a novella of _The Stormlight Archive_): It's implied that this is how Nale feels about his acolytes. At one point, Lift overhears him giving a dressing-down to his acolytes, noting that he's managed to learn more about their target during a morning stroll than they did for the past week.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: During the events of _A Mage's Power_, the Black Cloaks criminal gang tries to kidnap Princess Kasile but twice fail in their attempts to do. At that point, their leader realizes that he'll have to do it himself because his underlings are useless.
-   _Treasure Island_: Long John Silver actually has a rather simple plan: Let Captain Smollett get the ship to the island, let Trelawney and Livesey find and dig up the treasure, and then kill them on the way back to England and take the treasure. Unfortunately the rest of the pirates can't figure out why they shouldn't kill the honest crew _now_, and by the time they reach the island it's all Silver can do to stop them from breaking out into open mutiny before they get any clue as to where the treasure is hidden.
-   _Rubber Girl_: Melissa Robinson recognizes her classmate Katie Elaz in a news photo of Rubber Girl. But everyone else in her class do not see it even though Rubber Girl was obviously just Katie in a mask and Rubber Girl only showed up in town after Katie was hospitalized from an accident at her parents' factory. She facepalmed and groaned this line.
    
    **Melissa:** I'm surrounded by retards!
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   A heroic example is seen in _Dad's Army_ with Captain Mainwaring's opinion of his men (the joke being that some of them probably feel exactly the same about _him_). As he states in the episode "Gorilla Warfare"-
    
    **Mainwaring:** You know, Wilson, over the years that I've come to know the members of the platoon, I've grown quite fond of them. But I can't help feeling sometimes that I'm in charge of a bunch of idiots.
    
-   _Blackadder_: Edmund at least from second season onward. Everyone except the title character is either insane, stupid, or both.
-   At one point, during a first season episode of _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, Joel Robinson, prompted by yet another difficult wrangling of the robots, declares in anger 'I'm surrounded by idiots, of my own design!'
    -   Also uttered by Kalgon, the Large Ham Big Bad of _Space Mutiny_, which was skewered by _MST3K_ several years later.
        
        "I'm being undermined by my own disciples!"
        
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In the first episode that he appears in, Spike explains his lack of perimeter guards to Angel this way.
-   Botija feels this way in _Chespirito_, especially regarding his wife Chimoltrufia and his best friend and criminal accomplice Chompiras, in the case of the latter Botija would normally punish his stupidity with a slap in the face. Should be noticed that of the three, Botija is by far the most intelligent, not only is he shown to know a lot of culture and history, in later seasons, once they left the life of crime and became law-abiding citizens working in a hotel, Botija is always shown reading. Of course, considering that both Chompiras and Chimoltrufia are dumber than average… It is also explained in-universe that Botija is not from the same poor and humble origins as Chimoltrufia and Chompiras, instead, coming from a high middle-class household, which may explain his more cultured persona.
-   Chilindrina also feels this way in _El Chavo del ocho_, especially when she teams up with Chavo and Kiko for mischief and/or she’s trying to trick them. Chilindrina shows a normal intelligence, if not higher than usual for a little girl: she’s not only very astute but also quite clever in the school episodes (her bad grades probable being a consequence of laziness instead). Of course, considering that stupidity is one of the main characteristics of both Chavo and Kiko, it isn’t hard to be portrayed as smarter.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Lonzak, in _The Adventures of Captain Proton!_ holoprogram, is an homage to this trope. His bungling gives Mad Scientist Dr Chaotica a frequent opportunity to emote his famous "FOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL!" line. Lampshaded also when Janeway (posing as Queen Arachnia) is trying to get Chaotica to lower his Lightning Shield so Captain Proton (Tom Paris) can attack.
-   In the original Disney _Zorro_ TV series, the evil commandant of the pueblo at one point actually said, verbatim, "I'm surrounded by incompetents!"
-   Aeryn in _Farscape_ references this when she considers who on board Moya is worth keeping. Running down the list, Crichton eventually gets annoyed enough to suggest she just have the whole ship to herself. Aeryn's response: "Mmm. Is that an offer?" Ironically, when one of the people she believes should have left Moya apparently dies later that episode, she reacts with open horror. Guess she was just in a bad mood.
    -   On the villainous side, Scorpius has a fairly miserable time putting up with people like Crais, Grayza, and most of Natira's minions. And an equally miserable time when he pulls an Enemy Mine and discovers that the crew of Moya, far from the tactical geniuses he had anticipated, were a Dysfunction Junction of spectacular scale whose continued survival drew as much from wild improvisation and moments of brilliance as any kind of strategic savvy.
        
        **Scorpius:** Now you understand what stupidity I have to deal with...  
        **Scorpius:** I may well have joined the wrong side.
        
-   King Arthur and Father Blaise in _Kaamelott_. Every time there's a Round Table recap of "heroics".
    -   The same in The Movie, _Kaamelott: Premier Volet_. Counts for Merlin too with Karadoc, Perceval and the workers in the Tunnel Network (who dug in the wrong directions and got easily lost underground).
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   _Kamen Rider Dragon Knight_: Downplayed. Despite General Xaviax's frequent complaints, his underlings are not actually stupid. They are normal people with their own motivations, goals, and Conflict Ball he didn't do much against. It's only logical that things don't always go the way he intended. Unfortunately, he can be an efficient villain even under such conditions. For example:
        
        _(about Brad Barett)_ What moron gave humans free will?!
        
        _(about the Cho Brothers)_ Enthusiastic, but not very bright.
        
    -   _Kamen Rider Build_ naturally runs into this a lot, being something of an Insufferable Genius. He has it even moreso late in the series when he reverts to his original, more abrasive personality of Takumi Katsuragi. Subverted in a late episode where he and his allies confront the Big Bad, and even facing a monstrously powerful evil they still engage in their usual comedic antics, causing Sento to remark "I'm surrounded by idiots..." before adding with a grin "...And I couldn't be happier!"
    -   _Kamen Rider Zi-O_: Tsukuyomi is mostly passive-agressive about the annoyances caused by overseeing an out of context future overlord, his pathologically hammy herald and the future overlord's wannabe assassin. Considering how they're all on the way to ensure and/or avert the Bad Future that have happened already, noone can blame her.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Ogrons, ape-like minions of the Master and the Daleks, are a literal version of this trope. Oddly, that's more of an Informed Ability, as they actually are fairly effective minions, able to hold their own against human soldiers or guerillas as well as draconians.
    -   In the Eighth Doctor Adventures, Sabbath's minions are an assortment of normal (but seemingly fairly well-trained; they can handle guns) Earth apes. They seem to be about as clever as can be expected, but don't comprehend video cameras and get scared if they hear one producing an imitation of his voice, suggesting he's a bit of a Bad Boss to them.
    -   Queen Katrika, in "The Mysterious Planet" uses this one almost by name while wandering round lost in the underground.
    -   Harrison Chase from "The Seeds of Doom" declares this twice in one episode.
    -   The Doctor themself sometimes complains about the human race in this way. Nine often called humans "stupid apes", while Twelve's go-to insult was "pudding-brains".
-   In an episode of _Babylon 5_, Emperor Cartagia comments that while he is infallible, he has to put up with everyone else making mistakes.
-   _Reba_: This is Reba Hart's default expression. (The other one is "I hate your living guts.")
-   On _The Wire_, Stringer Bell increasingly feels like this, which prompts his "40 Degree Day" speech. Even after that, some of his Mooks \*still\* don't get it. In an interview, Dennis Lehane, who wrote the episode, said he wrote that speech specifically to embody this trope.
-   Beautifully lampshaded in _Sanctuary_ after Magnus beats the crap out of a mook, steals his gun, and points it at the boss.
    
    **Forsythe:** Why? Why do I even hire these guys?
    
-   Much of the comedy of _Hogan's Heroes_ is on how Klink (hardly a smart man in his own right) is constantly moaning of the antics of Schultz and others under his command.
    
    **Klink:** Schultz, you're the most stupid man in the regiment. And what's worse, you're my top man.
    
-   Tywin Lannister in _Game of Thrones_ is a rare case of a Big Bad who, while unhappy about the situation, is aware of his subordinates' tendency toward idiocy and accepts it as a fact of life. That doesn't stop him from berating them for their incompetence, but he doesn't get _angry_ about it. He also considers his eldest two children to be stupid in their ways.
    -   He makes it clear when he notices Arya that he considers everyone else in the fortress to be the equivalent of blind cattle in terms of intellect, both for wasting good talent and for not noticing a girl dressed as a boy.
    -   When Arya has one of his lieutenants assassinated right in front of him, Tywin's brief sigh before calling for the guards seems to be less fear he was the intended target, but more exasperation that he's going to have to find someone to replace _this_ idiot!
    -   This is actually the reason he treats Arya so well until he hands her over to Gregor at least. He recognizes her as very intelligent and enjoys having conversations with someone on a strong intellectual level, which is rare for him. The only other subordinate that he considers remotely competent on a mental level is Tyrion, and he despises Tyrion for entirely different reasons.
    -   In a deleted scene from season 3, Tywin confronts Pycelle on how he knows the man's appearance as a hunched, doddering idiot is all an act, openly asking "am I the only one who sees through this performance? Is it possible so many have been fooled for so long?" Pycelle (speaking in a normal tone) admits even he can't believe it works so well. Knowing that, you can see in season 4 Tywin glancing about when Pycelle is speaking as if asking himself "Seriously? _No one_ sees this?"
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   Lieutenant Stone from the early seasons has the misfortune of having Those Two Guys Bulk and Skull as his subordinates. He can frequently triple the IQ of a room by entering, and he _knows_ it.
    -   _Power Rangers RPM_ features this with Tenaya 7, The Dragon; while she sometimes acts sassy towards her boss, Knight of Cerebus and evil AI Venjix, it is _easy_ to sympathize with her when she's dealing with the other Co-Dragons. In fact, it's lampshaded when Venjix calls her his most intelligent and reliable servant, and she remarks while looking at the other two that that's not saying much.
    -   Hell, practically every _Power Rangers_ villain has had to put up with having to conquer the universe with the aid of complete morons. Lothor and Divatox stand quite high on that list.
    -   In _Power Rangers in Space_, Astronema calls her Quantrons nincompoops. And she _built_ them.
-   Grimlord from _VR Troopers_ also felt similarly, at one point stating "I am surrounded by incompetence!" He winds up blowing most of his minions up and replacing them in the second season because of their repeated failures against the VR Troopers; his new forces still don't have much success.
-   House:
    -   House acts this way around his employees, and _is_ this when it comes to his patients — _especially_ the clinic ones.
    -   Cuddy's A Day in the Limelight episode has her surrounded by lazy, whining, conniving insurance companies, doctors, and assistants who expect her to sort out every problem they have.
-   On an episode of _Batman_, Catwoman is exasperated by the mooks working for her, and asks, "Why can't I get good help?"
-   In an episode of _Charmed_, Barbas mumbles this when his mole revealed itself when captured.
-   _Bassie & Adriaan_: The Baron is frequently full of anger because his henchmen keep making the same stupid mistakes over and over, managing to blow stuff up in his face or have Bassie and Adriaan escape.
-   This is actually a plot point in _The Following_: Wannabe Chessmaster Joe Carroll founds his cult of psycho killers to carry out his bidding. The problem is that _it's a cult of psycho killers_. They're all crazy and murderous, and directing them toward any kind of focused productive activity is next to impossible. The original cult implodes before the end of the first season, and Joe's later attempts to rebuild it keep running into the same problem: Ax-Crazy people just don't play nice together.
-   _The Good Place_: Played straight, then inverted, in Season 2. Most of the demons that work for Michael are morons, insubordinate, or both - but after the experiment fails 800 times, the other demons decide that Michael is the real problem.
-   _Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation_:
    -   In the Five-Episode Pilot "East Meets West", the Shredder is shown to have little patience for his Foot Ninjas' screw-ups.
    -   Silver is often annoyed by the idiocy of his henchmen, to the point that he considers letting them go in "Sewer Crash" after seeing how useful hypnotizing Donatello into committing robberies for him has become.
-   A non-villainous variant is Alex Trebek (Will Ferrell) from the _Saturday Night Live_ "Celebrity Jeopardy!" sketches. He just wants to host a game show, but he's stuck with celebrities who can't answer the simplest questions — and, of course, Sean Connery making rude jokes about his mother.
-   _Odd Squad_: A heroic example. This is Agent Olive's modus operandi when it comes to dealing with oddness-stricken clients and co-workers alike. Anytime someone's an idiot and she's around to witness it, she'll either be snarking about it, or will react with an expression that embodies this trope.
-   _Kingdom Adventure_: Magistrate Pitts _thinks_ his guards are dumb failures, and not entirely without reason. That said, he overestimates his own intelligence and underestimates that of his guards, often blaming them for his own shortcomings.
-   _Married... with Children_: Bud often felt this way about his family.
    
    **Bud:** Must I be the meat in an imbecile sandwich?
    
-   _Sherlock_: Mycroft implies this in his dialogue in "The Empty Hearse"; when discussing their relative intelligence, Mycroft says to Sherlock: "If you seem slow to me, Sherlock, imagine how real people are like. I'm living in a world full of goldfish." Worth pointing out that Sherlock has supersonic thinking processes compared to normal people, so if Sherlock is slow to Mycroft...
-   _Loki (2021)_: At one point, Loki is surrounded by dozens of people with their own Chronic Backstabbing Disorder. As everyone reveals their plans to usurp everyone else and it devolves into a giant brawl, Loki can be seen in the background, face in his hands. The best part (which for some reason Loki doesn't find funny) is that they're all timeline variants of him.
    
    **Loki:** This is a nightmare.
    
-   It's a common joke among fans of _Our Flag Means Death_ to refer to Izzy Hands, Blackbeard's beleaguered and long-suffering first mate, as being the only human character in a cast full of Muppets.

    Music 

-   "I am Surrounded By Incompetence", by You've Got Foetus on Your Breath.
-   Wrathchild America's "Surrounded By Idiots". Can be cathartic to hear.
-   Mr. Burns sings about his lazy employees to Smithers in '''Look at all those idiots''. The words surrounded by idiots is even in the lyrics.

    Myths & Religion 

-   A heroic example is presented in _The Odyssey_; Odysseus' men end up screwing Odysseus over time and time again, doing things like getting trapped on the Island of Lotus Eaters, opening the bag of winds just as they were almost home, and butchering Helios' sacred calves. Sure, it was Odysseus' fault that Poseidon was angry at them, but you'd think his men would know better than to piss off the rest of the pantheon.

    Podcasts 

-   Early in _Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk_, the Enchantress lampshades this trope about her group. Right after she ended up detecting her own group with a detection spell.
    
    **The Enchantress:** One is surrounded by incompetents!  
    **The Dwarf:** Wanna talk about your magic again?

-   Charles sometimes feels like this in _Absolute Power (BBC)_:
    
    **Charles:** I come in here in the morning, I look at him, I look at you, and I want to open the window and shout "I'm not mad! I'm the warden!"

-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Horus Lupercal expressed this feeling during the infamous Horus Heresy. With his Primarch brethren split evenly between himself and The Emperor, The Emperor got the likes of Sanguinius, Guilliman and Vulkan. Horus? He got the likes of the morose Konrad Curze, the useless-in-everything-but-a-fight Angron and the duplicitous Alpharius. He often bemoaned his ragtag group of allies.
        
        **Horus:** Strange is it not, that so many I wish beside me stand against me, while at my back are only the flawed and damaged. I am a master of broken monsters.
        
    -   During the Siege of the Emperor's Palace, Perturabo of the Iron Warriors - a man who had little enough respect for the intelligence of the people around him at the best of times - was left managing the whole affair while Horus was indisposed and most of the other Primarchs present were getting increasingly Drunk on the Dark Side. Eventually the aggravation of dealing with them managed to do what over a hundred years of back-breaking siege engagements couldn't and prompted Perturabo to just give up on them and leave.

-   Leon, a young man who arrives in a town where everyone is cursed to be stupid, in the play _Fools_.
-   In _1776_, John Adams continually laments this about Congress. Near the end, Franklin calls him out on his dismissive attitude and points out that the other Congressmen are accomplished men who have been given the trust and responsibility of their colonies, just like Adams, and deserve respect even if they disagree.
-   In _Pokémon Live!_, Giovanni is this to the point that Jessie and James give him migraines from sheer annoyance.
-   _Black Friday_: The members of the Wiggly cult are very much dimwitted, led only by their greedy desires and their undying admiration for a doll and Linda Monroe, much to the latter's dismay.
    
    **Linda:** Guys, while I don't want you to think for yourselves, I want you to know what I mean when I say my evil shit.
    

    Theme Parks 

-   In _The Eighth Voyage of Sindbad_ show at Universal's Islands of Adventure, Miseria bemoans, "Why is it so hard to find good help these days?", upon seeing all of her minions get plowed through by the heroes.

    Video Games 

-   _Bendy and the Ink Machine_: In Chapter 4, it's revealed that Joey Drew hired Bertrum Piedmont to build a Bendy-themed amusement park called Bendy Land. Henry ends up having to go through the never-completed park on the chapter's main quest, and inside Bendy Land, he finds an audio recording from a mechanic named Lacie Benton. Other than Bertrum Piedmont himself, it seems there were a lot of idiots working on the theme park. Lacie complains that half of her coworkers don't know the difference between a wrench and a steamroller.
-   _Command & Conquer: Red Alert_, in the twelfth Soviet mission, Stalin says the exact same line in response to Nadia and Georgi Kukov questioning his desire to obtain the Allies' Chronosphere.
-   In the _Jazz Jackrabbit_ manual comic (which serves as a premise to the game), Jazz learns from a rebel turtle that Devan Shell "has got a huge ego, so he tends to surround himself with morons."
-   Your minions in _Overlord I_ are so loyal, they would gladly jump into a giant smelter to fuel the forging of your new equipment. However, they're all complete fools.
    -   _Overlord II_ has Queen Fay and the ineffectual Stupid Good Elves. She gets out of her position soon after though, and one of the elves was only acting stupid.
-   Lazarevic in _Uncharted 2: Among Thieves_ after executing a soldier who stole from him: "I am surrounded by traitors and fools!!"
-   Cesare Borgia tries to play this card near the end of _Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood_, though by that point it's really more like "Surrounded by dead people and one very, very good Assassin."
-   _Pokémon Platinum_: After crafting a beautiful speech about recreating the world for Team Galactic, Galactic Boss Cyrus admits when you confront him that the speech he gave was somewhat of a lie in that the new world would be for him alone, as his minions are not worthy of being in it, telling you that "you yourself must know that they are uniformly useless and incomplete." ("Incomplete" is kind of Cyrus's favorite word.) In fairness, most of the minions you'll have faced, aside from the commanders, really _are_ useless.
    -   It's actually implied that Cyrus is actively and deliberately keeping his followers uninformed, as they'd leave the moment they learned what he was actually after (and they do in _Platinum_, and are mentioned in _Black and White 2_). The sole exceptions are the Commanders, who are either genuinely interested or Charon.
    -   By the end of _Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness_, Big Bad Greevil points out that after he finishes the XD project and makes irredeemable Shadow Pokemon, he would get to work on making Shadow Pokemon that can act independently so he doesn't have to rely on clunky Admins - like the five you beat down on the way to him. That kind of comment, from the man in charge of the evilest organization in Pokemon history, downplays Cyrus and his lies big time.
    -   A lighthearted example in _Pokémon Sun and Moon_: Team Skull Admin Plumeria admits the grunts are idiots but she finds it endearing, in an Annoying Younger Sibling way, and attacks you to defend her "cute, dumb brothers and sisters."
-   _Space Colony_: you control, or try to control, a series of idiots, slackers, and various personality problems.
-   _Touhou Project's_ Sakuya Izayoi has to clean and guard the entire Scarlet Devil Mansion in spite of having a virtual army of hundreds of guards and maids single-handedly because the other meidos (all of which are fairies, a race of infamously unintelligent nature spirits) would do more harm than good, and the other guards, including Butt-Monkey Hong Meiling, tend to sleep instead of stand watch. Which is just as well, they're too incompetent to stop the Kleptomaniac Hero Marisa, anyway. Somewhat Flanderized by fanon in Meiling's case: even though she does take the usual siesta, it doesn't interfere with her work in any way. She's actually quite good at dealing with riffraff, a talented gardener and a very good martial artist... none of that particularly useful when trying to stop Plot Armor\-infused characters.
    -   Reisen gets similar treatment; her boss is an absolute sadist Mad Scientist who experiments on her just to pass the time, none of the underlings she supposedly commands listen to her, Tewi (who they do listen to) is The Trickster who would rather torment her than help her, and the other Earth Rabbits are just as lazy, stupid, and easily distracted as any fairy. Because of these things, she winds up being just a no-good bunny, only useful for her sex-appeal.
-   In what appears to be a Shout-Out to _Austin Powers_, Geartop, a robot, says this when one of his gnome mooks lets the players enter his lair in _EverQuest_:
    
    **Geartop** shouts 'Deal with it! Whatever you do, don't open that door. They can't get in unless you open the . . . Idiots. I'm surrounded by fleshy idiots.'
    

-   King K. Rool mutters "I'm surrounded by fools..." in _Donkey Kong 64_, during a cut scene in which Lanky Kong makes fools out of a couple of Kritters.
-   A ganglord Sanchez in _Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive_ throws a magnificent temper tantrum including this complaint after the heroes steal some horses from his mooks. He even knocks one of his mooks out cold on the spot.
    
    **Sanchez:** _Mierda! Idiota!_ I can't believe this! You let one, **ONE** lousy American soldier steal your horses?!
    
-   A quest in _World of Warcraft_ called "A Wolf in Bear's Clothing" had the following intro:
    
    **High Warlord Cromush:** These worgen take us for fools! One would think that only an idiot would mistake one of their druids in bear form as a real bear. Unfortunately, there are many idiots here at the Forsaken Front. We've already lost a few battalions to organized worgen bear attacks. Yes, it's even more idiotic than it sounds.
    
-   _Super Mario Bros._: Bowser, in varying forms of media, suffers from this. While the degrees of stupidity vary, it's quite clear that his evil minions aren't smart enough for his liking.

-   There are Self Imposed Challenges in _The Sims 2_ which involve only directing one sim in a household, leaving the others to act under their own free will and capabilities. The "I'm Surrounded By Idiots" Challenge is one version, while the somewhat better-known Asylum Challenge turns the household into an insufficiently-equipped Bedlam House, with your playable sim forced to Go Among Mad People.
-   The Courier from _Fallout: New Vegas: Old World Blues_ is this (providing s/he has an INT higher than 1), with the majority of the people there being clinically braindead, with the beings actually capable of communicating with him being a nymphomaniac robot, his own Jerkass brain, a Large Ham Mad Scientist who cannot control THE VOLUME OF HIS VOICE!, a megalomaniacal toaster, and two bickering lightswitches. The only other sane people are Doctor Mobius, who is addicted to every drug in the game from the stress, and Doctor 8, who can only speak in programming code.
-   This tends to be the case with whoever the main character is in _Ace Attorney_. The most notable example is Miles Edgeworth, who is paired with the ever-bumbling, incompetent Detective Gumshoe.
-   Although he never says the phrase outright, this is more or less the mindset of Neku in _The World Ends with You_. Subverted in that his allies _really_ are competent (their reliability is variable but once in track they are powerhouses), it's just his distrust towards people interfering with teamwork and lowering their (both individual and joint) potential.
-   _Persona 4_ provides a rare heroic example with Naoto Shirogane before joining the Investigation Team, as in this gem while finding future teammates are Drunk on Milk during a school trip to Iwatodai.
    
    "Are you a pack of imbeciles!?"
    
-   _Persona 5 Royal_: Late in the game, the team has a slightly goofy conversation giving their newest member a codename. The most serious member of the team makes this comment in response:
    
    **Crow:** I'm surrounded by absolute fools...
    
-   _Dawn of War_: Farseer Taldeer takes this opinion of her Imperial Guard catspaws at the start of _Winter Assault_, and states to that effect twice. In _Dark Crusade_, she uses this thinking to justify a direct invasion of Kronus by the Eldar, suggesting that the other factions on the planet don't realise the threat the Necrons pose and wouldn't be able to stop them even if they did. At least in her not-so-humble opinion.
    
    _"The Imperials test my patience with their incompetence! Very well, we will deal with the Orks ourselves, but only because time grows short."_
    
-   Pagan Min of _Far Cry 4_ is a Bad Boss who tends to punish failure harshly, but in his defence, his underlings really do make some spectacular screw-ups, most prominently failing to check a prisoner for cell phones. His exasperated response:
    
    "Really, guys? We're not checking for these anymore?"
    
-   _Tyranny_ presents this as a roleplaying reason for the Fatebinder refusing to work with either of Kyros' two armies and instead make their own side — especially if you decide that _nobody_ is competent enough for you and decide to strike it out solo.
-   The various members of Batman's Rogues Gallery in the _Batman: Arkham Series_ often complain about how useless their Mooks are whenever the Dark Knight takes them out.
-   In the "Recall" trailer for _Overwatch_, Reaper gives this expression when one of the Mooks he brought along to deal with Winston flies through the window of the room he's in and crashes into a table. The kicker? He's able to somehow do this expression while wearing _a completely static skull-shaped mask!_
-   _Borderlands 3_: While Tyreen Calypso's entire power base relies on the fact that bandits are stupid enough to _pay her_ for the right to _die at her whim_, she still grumbles about how stupid they are more than once. One ECHO log is about her trying (and failing) to explain to a bandit about how they allied with Maliwan and they can't kill them. In another, she orders a bandit to "cut off your favorite leg" to demonstrate how loyal her followers are; he promptly cuts off _both_ of his legs, and she facepalms.
-   _Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories_ has this exchange:
    
    **Vincenzo Cilli:** I'll tell you what I know tough guy. Some of our boys have screwed up a simple, no brain, fucking job. Lousy bastards can't even pull off a simple raid. Marron! Why am I surrounded by so many fucking idiots?  
    **Toni Cipriani:** I don't know... 'birds of a feather?  
    **Vincenzo Cilli:** Oh, you're a fucking comedian! Well, laugh this off wise-guy. You're the one who's gonna clear this shit up for me! Now get over there and drag those morons back here!
    
-   Previously, _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City_ gave us this classic zinger, courtesy of Tommy Vercetti:
    
    _\[after meeting Avery Carrington for the first time at Ken Rosenburg's office\]_  
    **Tommy Vercetti:** Who are these pricks anyway? Lawyer pricks, rug-wearing pricks! I'm surrounded by pricks!
    
-   Asra Nox of _Starbound_ seems to have this opinion regarding her Occasus minions, if her journal in the Grand Pagoda Libary is any indication:
    
    _They exalt in their supremacist rhetoric and scamper around spreading their hate, but they just can't fathom the genesis of what's happening here._  
    _Still, better an army of morons than no army at all._
    
-   A brief non-verbal example occurs in _Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!_, in the closing cutscene of the Crystal Glacier world, where Shaman Tuk shakes his head disapprovingly upon seeing his underlings buried head-first in the snow. This is not present in the same cutscene's reinterpretation in the _Reignited_ remake, however, which portrays Tuk as looking more concerned than anything.

    Visual Novels 

-   During Fuuko's route in _CLANNAD_, Tomoya's sanity begins to strain as he is forced to spend more time with certain people. Who? Fuuko herself, Sunohara and Nagisa and her family, who are all as strange as Fuuko. Eventually he starts getting to the point where he wants to scream and ask "_Why are all you girls_ (Sunohara is generally excluded from notice) _such idiots!_" Obviously not a villain, but he almost says the line word for word.
-   _Danganronpa_: The Big Bad Monokuma actually averts this trope, being amused by the antics of his prisoners more than anything, and by all means, Monokuma/Junko’s minions within the Ultimate Despair are very competent. However, several other characters feel this way, and not without reason.
    -   Byakuya Togami, Ultimate Affluent Prodigy, from the first game is the most obvious example, as he considers himself to be above the other students in just about every respect. Some, like Yasuhiro Hagakure and Hifumi Yamada, just prove his point.
    -   In the third game, Kokichi Oma believes his classmates are too focused on turning on each other than defeating the killing game. He's not wrong either, and only succeeds in uniting everyone when they're united against _him_.
-   _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_: In the second game, Blaise Debeste sends out his henchmen to kidnap John Marsh. They end up kidnapping Blaise's own son Sebastian instead since for some reason they thought the best way to make sure they got the correct target is to ask them "Do you know Justine Courtney?" rather than something more concrete, like "Are you John Marsh?" One could fault Blaise for not providing them with a picture of the target, but since the target is a famous up-and-coming child actor starring in a big blockbuster movie whose face is already plastered _everywhere_ he probably didn't think he needed to.

    Web Animation 

-   In _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, this seems to be Emperor's general attitude towards his subjects, both his servants and common citizens of the Imperium. His sons are no exception and only Sanguinus and Malcador get a pass. To be honest, the Imperium has been showing its stupider side multiple times over the years, and Kitten, with whom the Emperor interacts the most often, is not the sharpest tool in the box either.
-   Everyone in _Combat Devolved_ seems to think this about their teammates.
-   _The Most Popular Girls in School_: Mackenzie Zales, whether it be with her Cheer Squad containing two dimwits and a mentally unstable bitchy Tsundere, or with Team USA's antics in Season 5. In this fanart, she even says the trope name word-for-word.
-   _RWBY_:
    -   Torchwick frequently shows disappointment at his underlings' performance. To be fair, the guys that he hires them from also show the same disappointment.
        
        **Hei "Junior" Xiong:** Torchwick hired my boys, and I guess he wasn't happy with them — _\[raises his voice so his gangsters can hear him\]_ — which is something I can relate to!
        
    -   In a non-villainous example in the same series, Weiss Schnee had this attitude towards Ruby and just about any student who isn't Pyrrha. She gets better.
-   In _Red vs. Blue_, this tends to happen to anyone of normal sanity who has to deal with the titular teams for any length of time. It starts out as mostly just Church, but later seasons add Washington and Carolina (and multiple secondary characters) to the lineup.
-   _Wacky Game Jokez, 4 Kidz!_ has Mickey the Dick, who clearly has this view towards the ditzy June and the bubbling nerd Eric.
-   Skeletor's plight is parodied in the web animation _Bo-Starr and the Masters of Galastrom_ (link):
    
    **Skullduggen:** You talk big, Bo-Starr, but you're no match for my legion of Invincible Deathbots!  
    _\[cue evil synth chords\]_  
    **Skullduggen:** ...which I'm _not_ going to be using. Go and get them, Grass-man!  
    **Grass-man:** Brwabrwabrwebrweebrweebrwabrwabrwah!
    
-   _Sam & Mickey_: Deborah.
    
    **Deborah:** _(to Barbie and Ken)_ How many cooking shows do we have to cancel because you keep getting drunk and making fools of yourselves on air?
    

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_ here:
    
    **Black Mage:** Well, at least I shall die as I have lived. _Completely_ surrounded by morons.
    
    -   And when he dies and ends up in Hell, Black Mage initially thinks he's dreamed the entire (mis)adventure to date:
    
    **Black Mage:** What a horrible dream. There was this idiot and these two other idiots. We kept running into idiots. So horrible.
    
    -   Black Mage's homicidal impulses seem directly linked to how many stupid things are said in his vicinity at any given point in time. For example, if three people are having a conversation which defies the laws of logic, he will probably snap and stab anything and everything in arm's reach. If his _sanity_ is finally broken by said stupidity, he'll just nuke everything in a five-mile radius with a hadoken.
    -   Then there's D'rizzl, the only Dark Warrior to possess both intelligence and skill: Garland occasionally gestures towards competence but is usually a moron, Vilbert is basically incapable of dealing with any problem outside of LARP, and Bikke is the only character dumber than Fighter. It's fair to say that he has a miserable time of it... which only gets worse when Black Mage takes over the Dark Warriors and D'rizzl is forced to pull an Enemy Mine with the Light Warriors.
        
        **Garland:** We've got Black Mage now. He's so evil he's got us living in squalor.  
        **Bikke:** And lava.  
        **Black Mage:** For basically no reason! (wink, finger-guns)  
        **D'rizzl:** Well, it's official. It's impossible to determine who's stupider than who.
        
-   _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_: In "Futures Trading", older alternative future Gordito is part of a resistance movement against intelligent dinosaurs. He clearly thinks some resistance members who accidentally attack Dr. McNinja are really stupid to do so, and makes a kind of "look what I have to deal with" face. He may be being a bit harsh, though.
    
    "Stop it! What's wrong with you? That's _obviously_ a man using a dead dinosaur body as a hang glider!"
    
-   _Darths & Droids_:
    -   Obi-Wan and Anakin confront Grievous:
        
        **Anakin:** So, what are you up to?  
        **Grievous:** My armpits in incompetence!
        
    -   Director Krennic also has some choice words, but fails to see the obvious answer.
        
        **Krennic:** You buffoons! You just destroyed important Imperial data! Stop missing them!  
        _(soldiers hold their fire)_  
        **Krennic:** Don't stop shooting! Start _hitting_ them! Why does the stench of incompetence follow me wherever I go??
        
-   _Demonade_ gives a female main character with two not so bright "Body Guards" who apparently let the inept thief go free because he got them to point out how their jobs sucked so bad they weren't paying attention, while their employer shows some measure of Genre Savvy and she actually utters the trope over three panels to emphasize how much she doesn't like her hired help.
-   A variation seen in _Girl Genius_ when Gil justifies rescuing a ditzy Damsel in Distress.
    
    **Gilgamesh:** If I let _everyone_ I thought was an idiot die, there wouldn't be many people _left_.
    
    -   His father, Baron Wulfenbach, often has the same reaction to people around him. (Gilgamesh eventually reaches the point where he realizes this explains a LOT of the Baron's behavior.)
    -   Apparently when you're a Spark you really do feel like everyone else is dumber than you are, because they are (intellectually that is; not in the common sense way).
    -   At least two of the Jager generals display this attitude about their followers as well.
-   _Homestuck_: While eventually revealed not be so bad underneath all his vitriol, Cyber and literal troll Karkat routinely calls everyone in the near vicinity idiots or similar terms of abuse. His rudeness seems to scale with the level of competency, with Munchkin Vriska getting the most and fellow Only Sane Man Kanaya getting next to none.
-   _How I Killed Your Master_: Master Fei chooses the insult 'oafs' but otherwise done precisely.
-   Da Chief from the Cliffport Arc in _The Order of the Stick_ is definitely surrounded by idiots.
-   Pretty much any villainous organization in _Sluggy Freelance_ has this problem. Of course, in the _Sluggy Freelance_ multiverse, there aren't many _non_\-idiots to choose from.
    -   In "28 Geeks Later", Zoë complains about everyone around her acting stupidly (basically like in a zombie parody, which the story is) by asking if everyone has been exposed to crazy-stupid gas or something. Then a flashback reveals that yes, they have, literally.
-   Silas Morth from _Exterminatus Now_ deliberately invokes this, since he plans to sacrifice his minions in exchange for power.
-   Captain Locke from _Ozy and Millie_ has a pirate crew that makes it seem more like he's running a daycare. Justified in that everyone in the alternate universe he hails from has Merlin Sickness.
-   The leader of the Church of the Narrative in _Vegfolk Fables_. His followers brag about how they never question anything told to them, interpret orders in punny ways and the whole lot of them combined can’t accomplish the basic skills that he can perform.
-   _Zebra Girl_: Sandra's minions aren't exactly bright. They seem to mean well, but they frequently go above and beyond what she expects of them, resulting in them almost killing Crystal and knocking Sam unconscious. Sandra's feelings about them include annoyance, disbelief, anger, and barely contained fury. She even goes as far as saying that she would have killed some of them on the spot if her combustion power actually worked on them.

    Web Original 

-   Sasha Hunter in _Greek Ninja_ feels that she is (and is right on a few circumstances).
-   Justified in _Sailor Nothing_: Dark General Cobalt's 'henchmen' (with one exception) are heartless made from the darkest impulses of the human mind (emphasis on "impulse") and are incapable of subtlety, organization, or planning. Or anything that doesn't immediately lead to satisfying those desires, really. And Cobalt isn't aware that the only reason _he's_ capable of it is because of magical help. Things really don't improve for him in the epilogue, even though he's gone on to command real humans in the normal world.
-   _SCP Foundation_ has the Mad Artist clique Are We Cool Yet, a bunch of a bunch of sociopathically pretentious modern art types with Reality Warper powers that they use to create Anomalous Art. Their leader, Jack Dawkins a.k.a. "The Critic", is frustrated to no end by his underlings' tendencies to make art that simply kills everyone who looks at it because the purpose of art is to spread a message, and dead people can't learn anything from it.
-   _Whateley Universe_: lampshaded by She-Beast during her confrontation with the Anti-Champion:
    
    Yes, I know, I know, it's MY fault, I hired them… bargain-basement villains, hired at the last minute… SO, this is why some supervillains are always screaming about being surrounded by incompetents.
    

    Web Videos 

-   _Agamemnon Tiberius Vacuum_'s mooks are all lovable dimwits. Especially Belvedere.

-   Villain Carla Brunelle from _Flander's Company_ is a Magnificent Bitch and a Dragon-in-Chief who is an actual treat in Season 2. Starting with Season 3, however, her boss is killed, and the only remaining competent member of her team is Badass Bookworm Nadège; the three others consist in a bunch of morons with horrible sense of fashion, with only one of them possessing actual (but lame) powers and fighting skills.
-   This is one of Henri the cat's laments in _Henri 2, Paw de Deux_: "The white idiot writhes on his chair, begging for cheeseburgers... I'm surrounded by morons."
-   _Hitler Rants_: While the Real Life Hitler is considered to be an inversion of this trope, the _Downfall_ parodies Hitler is played straight. Hitler's staff is mostly made up of idiots who have such incredibly useful skills as pointing at maps, providing Hitler with useless information, getting drunk, objecting to all of his plans, and ranting. Naturally it's often because of them that Hitler's schemes always backfire. It also doesn't help that most of the people who are slightly more competent are constantly targeting him for their own gain.
-   _How it FEELS to Play TF2_: As noted in "How it FEELS to play Engineer", playing a support class in _Team Fortress 2_ and locking down a vital area makes Lazy wonder more than any other class what the hell his team is doing when they fail to help him. He apparently imagines them all glitched out in the spawn room.

"WHERE IS MY TEAM?!"

-   _Life SMP_: Scott has a reputation for being The Smart Guy and the Only Sane Man of most of the server, and by Season 4, has a practically trademarked tone of voice specifically reserved for expressing exasperation and disappointment at everyone else's shenanigans.
    
    **Scott:** The whole branding that I'm like, the only one here with like, any brain-cells really stands.
    

-   In _Noob_, the guild of Gaea Admirers probably wouldn't have even existed if its members hadn't been a bunch of idiots. They want to assist Gaea, who is playing in an enemy faction because they are convinced that she's a Double Agent loyal to their own side. In reality, the events that made them come up with the Double Agent scenario are actually a Not Me This Time Frame-Up in which their own faction's top guild has a hand; this isn't even kept as a secret at least in the comic version of the story. An episode of the webseries also hints that Gaea's Manipulative Bastard tendencies have an Everybody Knew Already status to most players and that the members of the guild of Gaea Admirers are the only ones acting as if whatever they see her do should be kept secret. To top things off, they are also quite incompetent as helpers.
-   The Odd One utters this every time his teammates acts incompetent or doesn't go along with his plan. Since he plays Solo queue, this happens so often, it's almost his catchphrase.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: After Azula's captain completely ruins her attempt to capture her brother, the princess wisely trades in her Redshirt Army for a Quirky Miniboss Squad Power Trio. Played with in the season 2 finale, in which Azula's disguised sidekicks blab that they are Fire Nation. As it turns out, she had staged the situation; the Dai Li overhearing is key to their take over. Turns out she was better off with the redshirts — her Quirky Miniboss Squad has consciences, and when they storm out on her she loses a lot of SAN points.
    -   _The Legend of Korra_:
        -   The sequel series has a notable moment when Amon's mooks fail to capture Korra, who has _already_ been kidnapped and locked in a metal box by Tarrlok, but still manages to trick them into opening the box and letting her escape. Amon, having just warned them not to underestimate her, is not amused.
        -   The Earth Queen in Book 3 takes a leaf out of Scar's book by saying this exact quote while ordering her servants around.
-   _Kim Possible_:
    -   Interesting inversion when Shego constantly complains about her boss being a nitwit.
    -   On the other hand, the trope is played straight with Drakken's rank-and-file henchmen.
    -   Also, Shego seems to have been driven to her Face–Heel Turn by exasperation with her brothers' cluelessness.
-   In _Pinky and the Brain_, one is a genius, the other is, well... Pinky. They never specify which one is the genius or the insane one. Still, one is drawing complicated mathematical equations on a chalkboard, and at the same time, the other one is dancing around with his tongue hanging out and is tied up in a straightjacket... do they really _need_ to specify which one? Considering what happened when The Brain enhanced Pinky's intelligence, it might not hurt. Especially if you've seen the episode where The Brain actually lets Pinky attempt it on his own (the "Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering?" bit) and it WORKS until The Brain screws it up. On the other hand, we humans aren't shown as exceptionally bright either. With a few exceptions, folks are perfectly willing to accept the word of a talking mouse in an obvious disguise.
    -   Played straighter in _Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain_ where a lot of humour comes Brain now having to endure _two_ playful idiots while concocting his schemes.
        
        **Brain:** _\*bitterly\*_ I am completely alone...
        
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Mr. Burns, as stated in the Image Song mentioned above produced during the 1990s:
        
        _Look at all those idiots! Look at all those boobs! An office full of morons, a factory full of fools!_
        
    -   And in another episode:
        
        **Jackanapes! Lolligaggers! NOODLEHEADS!**
        
    -   Frank Grimes. The whole premise of his episode is watching a normal person trying to cope in Springfield. Eventually, his frustration overwhelms him and he gets himself killed.
    -   The episode "They Saved Lisa's Brain" has Lisa inducted into Springfield's Mensa chapter, which naturally consists of only a small handful of characters who bemoan this outlook of Springfield. When events end up giving them power over the town, however, they become Pointy Haired Bosses and argue over inane proposals, with Stephen Hawking of all people stepping in to give them the riot act and deliver the Aesop that even intelligent people can be equally childish.
-   In _SpongeBob SquarePants_, Squidward always says, "Why am I surrounded by idiots?"
    
    **SpongeBob:** _\[imitating Squidward\]_ Everybody's an idiot except me.  
    **Squidward:** Well, it's true!
    
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: Grievous makes it quite clear he is beyond exasperated with the foolishness of his battle droids, casually destroy them over every little thing. However, he acts quite different with organic allies and his own, notably _very snarky_ medical droid, who are more competent. Still, in "Lair of Grievous" he shouts:
    
    **Grievous:** You expect victory over the Jedi, but all you give me to fight them are Battle Droids!
    
-   Grand Admiral Thrawn from _Star Wars Rebels_ may not say this _per se_, but he no doubt thinks this frequently. The plans he comes up with, such as locating and ambushing the Rebels on Atollon and mass-producing TIE-Defenders on Lothal, have a fair chance of success if not for such underlings as Admiral Konstantine and Governor Pryce bungling everything.
    
    **Thrawn:** I expected Governor Pryce to fail, but not so completely.
    
-   Prime Evil, from _Filmation's Ghostbusters_. (However, his henchmen did prove themselves to be capable on rare occasions.)
-   _Transformers_:
    -   Megatron of the original _Transformers_ has nothing but bad things to say about Starscream's intelligence, bravery, and trustworthiness... but continually places him in a position of authority and trusts him with pivotal missions.
    -   In the G1 cartoon episode _Auto Berserk_, Megatron actually makes a rare pop culture reference by perfectly quoting _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid_, screaming out in the middle of battle "I've got MORONS on my team!".
    -   Deconstructed a few times where Starscream or some other Deception actually predict a definite error in Megatron's plan. He dismisses it as this trope until the problem inevitably occurs.
    -   In _Transformers: Animated_ we have this little gem from Megatron when Lugnut and Shockwave are brawling over who's the more loyal minion after some prodding from Starscream.
        
        **Megatron:** _\[facepalm\]_ Oh for spark's sake.
        
-   Lurky, bumbling henchman of Murky in _Rainbow Brite_, is not only clumsy and stupid but actually ''good''... he loves colors and happiness and everything Murky hates, yet he continues to obey Murky and Murky continues to employ him.
-   The Monarch of _The Venture Bros._: "I _hate_ it that you two are my best men!"
-   In _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)_, Skeletor was fond of going off on tirades against the intelligence of his many henchmen, calling them lamebrains and numbskulls several times an episode. Not that he was particularly bright himself. Maybe it was just a bad pun.
    
    **Skeletor:** I _have_ to be brilliant, just to make up for _them!_
    
-   _G.I. Joe_: Cobra Commander has never been very appreciative of his employees (not that his own battle plans were worthy of Sun Tzu either.).:
    
    **Cobra Commander:** _Idiots!_ I'm surrounded by _incompetent IDIOTS!!_  
    **Cobra Commander:** _Morons!_ I have _Morons_ on my payroll!  
    **Cobra Commander:** Why are great men always surrounded by lesser beings?!  
    **Cobra Commander:** I shall be waiting to reward your genius, or to have you beheaded for terminal stupidity! I have spoken.
    
-   Ganon's minions in _The Legend of Zelda (1989)_ definitely fit this description. Notably, in "The Moblins are Revolting", when they got sick of his abusive management style, they actually managed to overthrow him and tried to take matters into their own hands, leading to an extremely ill-conceived and self-defeating assault on North Castle. The main reason he keeps them around at all appears to be that since they always regenerate, he's basically got an infinite supply.
-   In _Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog_, Dr. Robotnik reaffirmed the lack of intelligence possessed by Scratch and Grounder in pretty much every episode. However they're typically his first choice to send after Sonic, and he often trusts them with important inventions he created. This was lampshaded in the episode "Spaceman Sonic" in which Sonic states that Robotnik will figure it cheaper to put Scratch and Grounder back together than to build new robots.
    -   In the episode "Robotnik's Rival", he claimed that this was deliberate to ensure that they never betrayed him. Given that he was gloating over the eponymous rival who had just been backstabbed by his own super-competent henchbot, (and given that it's Robotnik) this was doubtless an Ass Pull.
    -   From the episode "Blackbot the Pirate": "I'm surrounded by defective circuitry!"
    -   From "Robolympics": "I'm surrounded by a bunch of burnt-out circuits!"
-   Another rare heroic example: In _DuckTales (1987)_, Scrooge McDuck is preparing to retrieve his vast fortune from the Marinaras Trench. He sees Doofus, Launchpad, and Gyro Gearloose, the crew that will help him, trip each other up and fall all over the place. And so, Scrooge can't help but exclaim in exasperation, "MORONS! I've got MORONS on my team!!" Similarly, on _DuckTales (2017)_, Scrooge asks Launchpad if he can even pilot a submarine (he asks this AS Launchpad is at the controls and presumably has been for some time already). Launchpad replies that he once crashed a helicopter into a wading pool, to which Scrooge dejectedly replies "I've done more with less..."
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_:
    -   Shredder, Arch-Enemy of the Ninja Turtles, would often lament "Why am I surrounded by such brainless morons?". Shredder once actually took the stupidity of his henchmen in stride. After inventing a new robotic weapon, he told Rocksteady and Bebop that he named it after them. He called it "The Knucklehead".
    -   In _Turtles Forever_, he watches footage of the 2003 Shredder:
        
        **Shredder:** Oh, how I've longed for an ally such as this! So unlike the sniveling idiots that I've been forced to suffer!  
        **Krang:** I'm right here, I CAN HEAR YOU!
        
    -   Krang isn't particularly appreciative of Shredder's mental prowess either: "Morons! I'm surrounded by morons."
    -   Kraang Sub-Prime from the _2012 version_ often finds himself this whenever he is around his fellow Kraang especially how the way they speak.
        
        **Sub-Prime:** You guys are as dumb as a bunch of rocks! Seriously! What's taking so long?!
        
-   Krabo/Draffsack of _Insektors_ uses this excuse when the Yuks/Kruds plans fail. The thing is, he's actually right.
-   In _Donkey Kong Country_, K.Rool would bemoan his henchmen being, in his words, 'Home-spun idiots'.
    
    **K.Rool:** It's at times like this I find that I must ask myself again and again: "Do I really want the Crystal Coconut this badly?"
    
    -   Kranky Kong was also a heroic version, with his attitude towards Donkey and Diddy.
    -   In "Barrel, Barrel, Who's Got the Barrel?" has Klump being the Only Sane Man when his Kritter troops begin firing their guns at the slightest provocation.
    
    **Klump:** Stop, you moronic, robotic Kritters! _STOP!!_  
    **Kritter 1:** Did he stop?  
    **Kritter 2:** I thought he said fire!  
    **Klump:** When I said fire, I didn't mean, "_Fire!_" _(Kritters begin firing their guns in the air again.)_ Oh, what's the use?
    
-   Junkman's henchmen in _The Incredible Crash Dummies_, although it is his fault (he built them from scrap).
-   Megabyte in _ReBoot_, and _how!_ He's the most brilliant mind in Mainframe, and by rights should be routinely walking over Bob...but all his minions are Dumb Muscle With An F In Evil.
    -   Played hilariously straight when the plot makes them heroic sidekicks instead of evil henchmen.
    -   There was also the episode where Enzo accidentally made everyone (but himself) into dimwits.
-   In one late episode of _Gargoyles_, Xanatos's robot Coyote screws up. Xanatos sighs and, sounding more resigned than anything, says "It's so hard to build good help these days."
-   After a failed attempt to teach the other kids of the cul-de-sac after various demonstrations of their stupidity in "Dim Lite Ed", a lamenting Edd of _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ says this verbatim. He also says this in the episode "O-Ed Eleven".
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_:
    -   In "Lightspeed", Jinx remarks "I don't know why I hang around with you nitwits." By the end of the episode, she's done hanging around with those nitwits.
-   Phaeton in _Exo Squad_ is constantly berating his generals for their incompetence. Even when they're right. ESPECIALLY when they're right.
-   In _The Fairly OddParents!_ "Wishology" trilogy, The Lead Eliminator is noticeably more competent than his comrades.
-   Duke Igthorn on _Adventures of the Gummi Bears_ probably would've have been more successful in conquering Dunwyn if his ogre minions (well, except for Toadwart) didn't have the intelligence of mayonnaise.
-   More than once on _Sheep in the Big City_, when General Specific's army men turn incompetent, he expresses; "I'm surrounded by buffoons!" Then, the camera pans out to show _actual madmen_ out of nowhere, encircling him and bumbling incoherently in propeller hats and diapers.
-   Cat from _CatDog_ always feels like this amongst the people of Nearburg (although sometimes he can be pretty shortsighted himself). And to make it worse, he's attached to one!
-   Benson from _Regular Show_ is often frustrated with the laziness and incompetence of Mordecai and Rigby.
-   Adam Lyon from _My Gym Partner's a Monkey_, who is pretty much the only sane student at Charles Darwin Middle School. With the possible exception of Windsor Gorilla, although even his animal instincts cause problems every now and then.
-   Slinkman and Edward from _Camp Lazlo_ are pretty much the only two people at Camp Kidney who are fully aware about how awful it is, contrasting Scoutmaster Lumpus' apathy towards its dismal conditions and Lazlo's enthusiasm for the place.

-   Aku complained about this more than once in _Samurai Jack_ (and the majority of his minions being mindless robots didn't tend to help). That Jack was able to turn his robots to junk with such ease was the biggest reason he tried to face him mano-a-mano in "Jack Versus Aku". Of course, in _that_ episode, the breaking point for him was a pretty big Epic Fail, when he sent a whole army of robots after Jack, and then _one_ of them tripped, causing _all_ of them to fall over like dominoes, destroying the _entire_ army. Jack never did a thing. You can't blame Aku for wanting to rethink his plans after something like _that_.
-   _Bob's Burgers_: Bob Belcher is frequently the Only Sane Man in his family (and to a lesser extent everyone else in town), so he has his moments of feeling like this.
-   On _King of the Hill_, Hank frequently feels this way, due to the various harebrained schemes that his friends and family pull off that he then must fix.

-   On _The Hair Bear Bunch_, whenever Mr. Peevly wasn't annoyed by the antics of the bears, he was frustrated by the incompetence of his oafish assistant, Botch.
-   Limburger from _Biker Mice from Mars_. _Especially_ when it comes to The Dragon, Greasepit.
-   Scarecrow has a pair of oft-insulted henchmen who "never liked school" and are impressed to find they're working for an (ex)professor in his introductory episode of _Batman: The Animated Series._
-   Fung's bandit gang in _Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness_. It's even more frustrating considering that Fung had given themselves a year to be successful in the trade; now it's month 11 and the crocs are definitely still stumblebums.
-   Derek Powers in _Batman Beyond_ is a living radiation generator. His doctors, picking him up from a frozen-over lake, have brought him a blanket in case he's cold. Powers just glares angrily and states "You are _idiots_."
-   _Invader Zim_:
    -   Dib.
        
        **Dib:** Okay, am I the only one who sees the alien sitting in class?
        
    -   At least Dib still has some hope for humanity. His sister, Gaz, on the other hand, sees everyone around her as idiots. Like Dib, she knows Zim is an alien. But unlike him, she finds it stupid to even care.
        
        **Dib:** Don't you care that ZIM is trying to destroy all mankind? Huh?  
        **Gaz:** But he's _so_ _**bad**_ at it.
        
-   The Sheriff of N.O.T.T. from _Rocket Robin Hood_ shouts a variant of this tropes when insulting his Guards for failing to keep Rocket Robin Hood and Little John in a pit. The exact speech:
    
    **Sheriff:** IMBECILES! BUFFOONS! COWARDS! I'm surrounded by cowards! I asked you to guard twoooo prisoners! Just — TWOOOOO! PRISONERS! I EVEN PUT THEM 10 FEET UNDERGROUND IN A STEEL VAULT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU! _\[then, he calms down somewhat\]_ And, what happens?
    
-   The intro song to _Daria_ has the repeated lyric, "You're standing on my neck," alluding to the title character feeling this way about her peers; their presence is so smothering that she can't function normally.
-   _Storm Hawks_:
    -   With the exception of the Dark Ace and later her Nightcrawlers, this is Master Cyclonis's situation with her empire. If her troops aren't screwing up, it's her Generals Snipe (who's just plain stupid despite his brute strength) and Raveness (who _is_ intelligent and skilled, but nowhere near as much as she thinks of herself with a side-order of rebellion on top of it). No wonder the Storm Hawks always win.
    -   Repton feels this way about his brothers/members of The Raptors, and really he can't be blamed for it as events show he clearly got the lion's share of their collective intelligence.

-   _Los Trotamúsicos_: The archnemesis of the series, Chef, usually blames his henchmen for all their failings.
-   _Scooby-Doo_:
    -   _The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo_ episode "When You Witch Upon a Star" has Marcella having to rely on the Brewski Sisters, a trio of incompetent witches based off The Three Stooges, to free her from another dimension she got trapped in after being released from the Chest of Demons with the rest of the 13 ghosts in the series premiere. She makes it clear whenever she is outraged by the Brewski Sisters' bumbling.
    -   Dr. Phibes, the main villain of _Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get A Clue!_, is frequently irritated by his henchmen's bumbling.
-   The Owl in _The Owl & Co_, which often leads to the Owl suffering mishaps.
-   Helga Pataki or Grandpa Phil of _Hey Arnold!_ often respond to idiocy by using a shortened version of "I'm surrounded by idiots" by saying "I'm surrounded."
-   On _Dora the Explorer_ in _Dora's Fairytale Adventure_, the witch is this. While she's a case of Vile Villain, Saccharine Show, her minions don't seem to be capable of doing anything quite right and at one point actually get so caught up in one of Dora's accomplishments on her path to becoming a true princess that they cheer for her.
-   _House of Mouse_ has Practical Pig and Miss Turtle. They often give the people around them a nasty look on their faces because they feel this way.
-   Despite being stupid, Penny from _The Mighty B!_ feels this way. Especially when she bullies Bessie. She thinks she's the Only Sane Man at the Honey Bee Academy even to her true friends, Portia and Gwen.
-   Mildred from _Scaredy Squirrel_ is the only sane character on the show and doesn't want to contribute into the insanity created by dimwitted protagonist Scaredy or criminally insane Nester.
-   In one episode of _James Bond Jr._, Dr. No orders his men to kidnap Major Boothroyd, aka Q. Unfortunately for him, they kidnap Horace Boothroyd, aka I.Q., Boothroyd's grandson! When his lieutenant points out that I.Q. answered the fake phone call, Dr. No says, "I'm surrounded by incompetents!" It is certainly funny!
-   This is how Momo feels about his minions the Blup Blups, as he often says so in most episodes of _Star Street: The Adventures of the Star Kids_.
-   Dr. Gangreen in _Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!_ constantly mentions the stupidity of his minions, especially in reference to his main minion Igor. Zoltan and his band of tomatoes are more competent but still manage to enrage him.
-   King Max feels the same about his minions Sheky the Jester and his two dogs in _The Biskitts_.
-   Mother Brain often mentions her minions' stupidity in most episodes of _Captain N: The Game Master_. Usually her ire is aimed at bungling morons Eggplant Wizard and King Hippo. Dr.Wily usually escapes the worst of her verbal abuse, as he displays his competency often enough to be genuinly useful.
-   In _Kidd Video_ Master Blaster is constantly insulting his henchcats the Copycats with derogatory terms both related to their lack of intelligence and/or furry nature, and he’s also constantly threatening them with horrible tortures.
-   Mr. Cat from _Kaeloo_. The closest thing he has around him to a remotely intelligent life form is the Ditzy Genius Quack Quack, and in fact he's suffering from a ridiculous amount of stress due to the people around him.
-   In _LEGO Elves_, the Goblin King is constantly frustrated by his incompetent goblin mooks.
-   _Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines_: In "Fly-By-Knights," Dick Dastardly bemoans "What's a nice guy like me doing in a goof-up squadron like this?"
-   The _Bonkers_ episode "The 29th Page" had Al Vermin quip about having to give his goons dumbbells for Christmas when they're having trouble opening a safe, then retracting his statement after deciding that he doesn't want any more dummies working for him.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_ provides a rather dark example with Lila Rossi: she flat-out states to Marinette that everyone in their class besides them is an idiot (and given how easily she manipulates even the teacher it's hard to say she's wrong), and this justifies her manipulation of their class into adoring her.
-   _The Mr. Men Show_: Mr. Grumpy and Mr. Rude.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   Twilight Sparkle feels this way when she visits Ponyville for the first time. She gets better, though.
        
        **Twilight Sparkle:** All the ponies in this town are _crazy!_
        
    -   In the episode "The Mean 6", the evil clone of Twilight feels this way about the other clones created alongside her, calling them "fools" and "imbeciles". She's not wrong; while she makes a fairly competent grab for power and comes close to success, the others set off the Tree of Harmony's defenses and get her _and_ themselves killed.
-   Dracula in _Castlevania (2017)_ certainly feels this about his court. Most of them are actually highly competent, but they don't get along at all and spend most of their time bickering or planning to backstab him.
-   _What If…? (2021)_: In episode 2, the Watcher explains that in the main universe, Yondu Udonta picked up Peter Quill himself. In this universe, he outsourced the job to two of his crew... who proceeded to go to the wrong side of the planet and pick up T'challa instead.
    
    **Yondu Udonta:** You morons grabbed the wrong kid.  
    **Taserface:** Uh-uh. Not so fast, Captain. _\[points to the black T'challa\]_ Two see-holes, two hear-holes, one eat-hole. Everything checks out.  
    **Yondu Udonta:** _\[shows a picture of the Caucasian Peter Quill\]_ Does this really look like Peter Quill to y'all?  
    **Taserface:** Sure. I don't know. All humans look alike to me.
    
-   _Four Eyes!_: In alien protagonist Emma's opinion, at least. She thinks humans are an underdeveloped species.

## Do You Think I Am A Idiot?

Marcel is infuriated by his goons' stupidity in general but he is particularly infuriated by their stupidity after the two poorly tried to cover up the fact that Blu and Jewel escaped by painting two chickens blue with him even rhetorically asking if they think he is an idiot and remarks that Nigel The Cockatoo is ten times more intelligent than both of them combined. Nothing we see through the movie contradicts this assumption.
