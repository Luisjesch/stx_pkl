_O listen to him and his saxophone  
Our musical genital unicorn  
He's very well hung with his golden horn_

A short riff on the saxophone used to indicate the arrival or presence of a sexy person. The riff can be as subtle as how loudly the music is played.

The muted trumpet can be used to similar effect.

The history of this trope comes from the fact that jazz and R&B were played in brothels and burlesque houses. The musicians were supposed to play music to, ahem, enhance the experience. Many jazz musicians' nicknames were often euphemisms, like Jelly Roll Morton, which reflected their roots as brothel musicians.

A Sister Trope to Bow Chicka Wow Wow.

Compare other Mood Motifs.

May overlap with Creepy Jazz Music.

Not to Be Confused with the device in _Brave New World_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , nor a character having sex _with_ a saxophone, nor Sexy Sax Man - though this trope can certainly apply to the music they play with their sax - nor a sex hotline.

-   A Running Gag in _Fatal Instinct_; the Femme Fatale is always accompanied by a steamy sax tune because a professional sax player follows her around, providing her with a theme tune while hiding in hallways, closets, even in her bed. And he's replaced by a trumpet player in one scene because he had to call in sick.
-   A saxophone solo was included in the Theme Tune from _The Invisible Woman (1983)_. It may also have been Alexa Hamilton's musical signature in the movie.

-   Played for Laughs in _Tango and Cash_ when Cash dresses in drag to escape from a nightclub.

    Literature 

-   In the novel _Brave New World_, the hedonistic dystopia actually renamed the musical instrument the sexophone. (That is if it really is the same instrument and not something...different.)
-   Played with in Douglas Adams' _The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul_:
    
    "There emerged from the car a pair of the sort of legs which soundtrack editors are unable to see without needing to slap a smoky saxophone solo all over, for reasons which no one besides soundtrack editors has ever been able to understand. In this particular case, however, the saxophone would have been silenced by the proximity of the kazoo which the same soundtrack editor would almost certainly have slapped all over the progress of the vehicle".
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Boy Meets World_ uses this once when Topanga enters the room in a sexy nightgown to show that she is finally ready to have sex with Cory, in one of her very few fanservice-y moments in the show.
-   Used once in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ as Buffy, under the influence of a love spell, enters the library wearing a raincoat, heels, a smile, and nothing else. Interestingly, the sax riff telegraphs her _intent_ (to seduce Xander) every bit as much as her arrival.
-   _Cowboy Bebop (2021)_. An In-Universe version occurs in "Callisto Soul", when a lingerie-clad dancer is trained by Gren with the assistance of a sax player.
    
    **Gren:** Feel those notes nibble your neck...
    
-   When discussing Rep. Weiner's tweets on _The Daily Show_, a shirtless cameraman shows up in the background playing the sax riff from George Michael's song "Careless Whisper".
-   The second version of the closing ident for MTE—an imprint of MCA Television—used in the early to mid 1990s, was typically punctuated by a saucy saxophone riff. Among the series that used this was HBO series _Dream On_.
-   In _Flower Boy Ramyun Shop_ a sexy saxophone tune plays when Eun Bi pulls Chi Soo in for a kiss, as she was playing his own game (of seducing people because he can and then dropping them) against him.
-   On _The Joe Schmo Show_, a musical theme that began with this was used regularly when showing scenes of something that was sexy or wasn't actually, but they wanted to play it as it was for comedy.
-   _The Munsters_ used this at least once, when Grampa's latest invention turned Herman into a woman.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ has made a few jokes about this.
    -   In _The Brain That Wouldn't Die_, this type of music plays (as the Villain Protagonist trolls for potential victims) and Tom Servo quips, "It's a sleazy morning out there. You're listening to KPORN, _Holmes and Reems in the Morning_, playing sleazy, slutty music all morning long. Here's one by Skinny and the Sweat Beads..."
        -   Mike brings the riff back later when the music makes its reappearance. "Stay tuned for the obscene phone call of the day, on KPORN".
    -   In _The Horrors of Spider Island_, there's a muted trumpet playing as a bikini-clad model takes a shower. Crow quips, "Those musicians who play muted trumpet solos must love these movies".
        -   And "I wasn't even being sexy until the dirty sax music started!"
    -   Tom Servo was prone to doing the mute-trumpet riff on occasion, to add sexual subtext to the scene where it really didn't belong. His voice actor, Kevin Murphy, continues the tradition in various RiffTrax.
-   In the miniseries adaptation of James Clavell's _Noble House_, one of these was used at the beginning of nearly every scene where Venus Poon showed up.
-   Used a _lot_ in _Scrubs_, along with copious amounts of Gaussian Girl and Hot Wind whenever an attractive female character is first introduced.
-   Used in the song "History is Made at Night" from the Show Within a Show from _Smash_, _Bombshell_.
-   The theme tune to _Square One TV_ (not the remixed version, which replaced it with a synthesizer).
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_. In "Tomorrow is Yesterday", an air force officer from the 20th Century is beamed on board Enterprise, and the first bizarre thing he witnesses is one of the miniskirted Bridge Bunnies striding down a corridor, accompanied by a few bars of muted trumpet.
        
        **Christopher:** _(dumbfounded)_ A woman?
        
        **Kirk:** Crewman.
        
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: "The Royale" features some sexy saxophone playing when the characters of the simulation play out a romantic scene. The music is a nod to the fact that the simulation is taken from a trashy novel.
    -   Also happens in the _Star Trek: Voyager_ episode "Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy", where the Doctor programs himself to randomly daydream. Given that the Doctor's programming would make him Genre Savvy as hell about this kind of information, it's perfectly logical that an _extremely_ exaggerated version of this trope plays when he slips into a daydream about Seven of Nine, B'Elanna, and Janeway all shamelessly flirting with him. It's hilarious.

    Music 

-   Billy Joel's "Christie Lee" crosses over with this in an interesting way, as Joe the saxophonist finds out to his misfortune.
-   George Michael's "Careless Whisper" _IS_ the sexophone Standard Snippet. Arguably a case of Lyrical Dissonance, as the song is really about the terrible guilt and shame the narrator feels from cheating on a lover.
-   Gerry Rafferty's "Baker Street" _IS_ the other sexophone Standard Snippet. It's a melancholic jazz song about the gloomy London street, which the lyrics and city theme could be applied to romance, relationships, and lost loves, but listeners are more hooked to the particularly long saxophone riff - played as a solo for eight bars between each set of verses - performed by Raphael Ravenscroft; so much so that upon its release, saxophone sales went up just to play that riff.
-   Glenn Frey's "The One You Love" opens with a pretty lengthy and sensuous sax solo that it's been used in many television shows as either a Ready for Lovemaking signal or the introducing shot to a seedy place.
-   Jason Derulo's "Talk Dirty", though the girls in the video are clearly playing trumpets.
-   "You Got It All" by The Jets is a serenade to a Second Love with a saxophone riff in its intro.
-   Fifth Harmony's "Worth It", which, as many have pointed out when it first came out, sounds quite a bit like "Talk Dirty".
-   Etta James' song "I Just Want To Make Love To You" features a prominent saxophone throughout. Many might recognise the song from the Female Gaze Diet Coke commercials.
-   If you think "Destination Calabria" by Alex Gaudino, sung by Crystal Waters, is not this in its saxophone, it's just because you haven't see the music video.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   This is one of Aksana's theme songs.
-   In a rare male version, this was the theme music for "wrestling porn star" Val Venis.
-   Before that, that was the theme music for The Model Rick Martel. Venis's theme is actually Martel's theme sped up.

    Sports 

-   In contrast to the high-energy "walk-up music" used by most baseball players, starting in May 2014, Oakland Athletics outfielder Josh Reddick opted for "Careless Whisper" by George Michael. The fans seem to approve.

    Theatre 

-   All over the place in _City of Angels_, especially the intro to "Lost and Found".
-   _Evita_ has a saxophone theme during the song _I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You_, the scene where Eva seduces Peron.
-   _Funny Girl_: It's part of a nightclub act rather than something more _risque_, but the fairly stripperiffic song "Cornet Man" is unsurprisingly about a man who plays the cornet (basically a mellower-sounding version of the trumpet). Also, some of the lyrics can be taken as double-entendres suggesting the Cornet Man has reasons other than simply a "gig" to "leave his wife and kiddies" and go on the road, though it's not clear whether these were intentional or the song has fallen victim to Have a Gay Old Time syndrome.
-   One of the strippers the young Gypsy Rose Lee meets in _Gypsy_ uses a trumpet as part of her routine.
    
    _"I (bump) and I (bump), and I , (bump), (bump), (bump), but I do it with a horn!"_
    
-   A very early example occurs in Jules Massenet's 1881 opera _Hérodiade_ (based on a story by Gustave Flaubert). King Herod's aria "vision fugitive," about his lust for his stepdaughter Salome, features a suggestive alto saxophone part to represent his thoughts of her.
-   _Miss Saigon_ features a wailing saxophone song just _prior_ to the leads having sex. They later recall they night they met, singing "a song, played on a solo saxophone..." to the tune of the riff.

    Video Games 

-   Martine's theme in _The 7th Guest_, reprised when Carl encounters her ghost in _The 11th Hour_.
-   _Bully_ plays a sexophone riff whenever the hero finishes a mission that ends with getting a kiss from one of the girls.
-   _Chulip_: A sax riff plays whenever a successful kiss is made.
-   In _Deadly Premonition_ a very sultry (but hectic) jazz piece with heavy sax plays as the leitmotif for the Laura Palmer character. It's also used in the scene where Emily takes off her shirt to show that she doesn't have the Raincoat Killer's tattoo on her back, which betrays that scene's real purpose.
-   Candy's theme in _Donkey Kong 64_ uses the muted trumpet variation.
-   In _Fantasia: Music Evolved_, before or during the song "Fire" by Jimi Hendrix, the player can substitute the saxophone from the "Eddie Kramer Orchestral Mix" for Jimi's vocals and the song would sound more instrumental and sexy... in a game for ten-plus-year-olds. And this is coming from a guy whose song origins in "Fire" date back to when Noel Redding invited Jimi to stay at the house of Redding's mother at New Year's Eve and to the events that followed.
-   _Guilty Gear_: Slayer has 2 themes, _Haven't You Got Eyes In Your Head?_ from XX and _Jack-a-Dandy_ from Xrd, feature a pretty wicked one.
-   _The King of Fighters_: Iori Yagami has his themes which play usually jazz-themed with a sweet saxophone solo. Many of these tunes have the words "Arashi no Saxophone" ("Stormy Saxophone") in the title.
-   _Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work_ has a song called "Saxy Sex".
-   The Consort in _Mass Effect_ is introduced with a saxophone solo, while the camera follows her lower backside up a staircase.
-   _Metal Gear Solid_:
    -   A long saxophone solo is played when Fortune first appears in _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_. Granted, she's not particularly fanservice-happy, but she's one of only three female characters in the game.
    -   Makes up EVA's theme tune in _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_, almost as a parody.
-   Spoofed in _Mother 3_, as it is the leitmotif of the not-quite-so-sexy Magypsies. The saxophone there had a weird, reverberated, distorted kind of sound to it. Later on in the game, it even serves as a Musical Spoiler as to the true identity of Fassad as Locria, the seventh Magypsy. And then there's Flint's attack instrument...
-   The Plunger Thing from _Paper Mario: Color Splash_ has this music playing while it plunges every enemy on the field.
-   _Persona_:
    -   _Persona 4_ has the track Muscle Blues, which is essentially the theme song for a character's fairly gay Shadow.
    -   The _Hiimdaisy_ comic, along with the fandub, manages to make the above so much funnier. "I'm Kanji Tatsumi, and I enjoy naked men! Oh yeah~"
    -   Ayase/Alana in _Persona_. "Ow, my chest hurts!"
    -   Lisa/Ginko in _Persona 2_ also has the Tempt/Seduce like Ayase above, with the sexophone to match. She can also drag Maya and an unwilling/embarrassed Yukino to do a triple seduce... with the sexophone to match.
-   _Pokémon X and Y_:
    -   This plays when using the move Attract.
    -   The moves Disarming Voice and Captivate also involve sax riffs.
-   In _Saints Row IV_, the romance cut scenes end with this playing.
-   In the arcade game _Silent Scope_, a short riff plays when you find a woman in the background and point your sniper rifle at her. It helps that the character you're playing as gasps "Wow!" at the same time. (You get a bonus life point for this.)
-   In _Sly Cooper_, this often happens when Carmelita Fox shows up.
-   In _Spore_, a cheesy sax riff plays when the player mates in Creature Stage. If this sounds steamy to you, you'll be disappointed to find that the mating dance consists of the two creatures waving their butts at each other.
-   Here's this gem from the ESRB's description of _Trauma Team_: Female patients are asked to explain their symptoms, then lift up their shirts for closer inspection. The scene contains no nudity, but a saxophone can be heard playing in the background as a male doctor makes the following remarks: "Can she really be that thin?," "dayum!," and — after doctor's heart rate increases — "It's only natural... I'm a straight male".

    Web Animation 

-   In _EQUESTRIA GIRLS_, sexy sax music signals that love is in the air (since the characters' facial expressions can't signal that). First, it's played straight, then it's used for a fight scene that unexpectedly turns into a love scene. Then it's used for a truly bizarre scene where the Moon from _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_ falls in love with Rarity, but she doesn't reciprocate.
-   The trope is name-dropped directly in _Helluva Boss_ episode 'Exes and Oohs', as well as played straight during Chaz's song to Moxxie.

    Web Original 

-   Lampshaded by Ben and Kerry of 2funnybastards.com and Hamilton, Ontario's Y108: "What is Kenny G. doing in everyone's bedroom ever?"

-   Cracked's summary of the _Terminator_ movies includes this line:
    
    Two naked men appear and come after her. Luckily, no saxophones are playing at the time, so it becomes an action movie.
    

    Web Videos 

-   The sexophone riff in George Michael's "Careless Whisper" shows up whenever Bennett the Sage has his alter ego Suave turn up. It's also used to sex up the mood or parody a Ho Yay riddled scene whenever Sage feels like it's appropriate.
-   In _Code Geass: The Abridged Series_, Kallen's shower-phone call has "extremely suggestive jazz music" playing.
-   The background music in _Spooning With Spoony_.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_ also features "Careless Whisper"'s sexophone during particularly Ho Yay\-filled scenes.

    Western Animation 

-   The same three-note sting is played every time someone on _6teen_ looks "sexy", whether female or male.
-   Used in the phone sex ad in the _Beavis and Butt-Head_ episode "1-900-BEAVIS".
-   This appears several times in a _Big Hero 6: The Series_ episode where Aunt Cass gets a date.
-   The _Bump in the Night_ episode "Party Poopers" had saxophone music briefly play when Molly Coddle tears off the dress the Cute Dolls gave her to wear at their party.
-   In the _Darkwing Duck_ episode "Beauty and the Beet", this is used for sexy scientist Rhoda Dendron.
-   One would occasionally be played for Rosie O'Gravy from _Dog City_. Specifically whenever Ace Hart has an internal monologue in which he thinks fondly of her. Given the animated segments of the series parody classic detective stories, this is perhaps not surprising.
-   The Sexophone is played in _The Emperor's New School_ whenever Kuzco sees Malina.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   In "Family Guy Viewer Mail #1", Peter wishes for his own personal soundtrack from a genie. The music engages in some Mickey Mousing, but when Peter and Lois are about to get intimate it turns into funky Sexophone music.
    -   Then there's the two of them engaging in "phone sax", which is playing sexy saxophone songs over the phone to each other. Lois does it _with her vagina_.
        
        **Peter:** Don't wash the mouthpiece.
        
    -   In another episode, Peter watches a film with Allison Janney, and a sexy sax is heard as she steps out of a cab and the camera pans upward. However, her legs seem to go on forever, leading to a note that gets held for so long, the sax player has to pause a moment to catch his breath.
-   _Kim Possible_: Shego makes an entrance (at 1:20) as a distraction, with squealing trumpet.
-   _Milo Murphy's Law_: A Running Gag on the show is Mrs. Murawski gushing over her hand-made desk, which often prompts a snippet of suggestive saxophone music.
-   Both played straight and averted in _The Ren & Stimpy Show_. The sexophone was used both upon arrivals of attractive women, as well as various scenes involving Stimpy (e.g.a scene of him stripping off his fur before going skinny-dipping).
-   Showed up as a joke in _Star Wars: Clone Wars_: A snatch of "stripper music" plays when C-3PO first shows off his new gold plating.
-   In _Sym-Bionic Titan_ (co-created by _Clone Wars_' showrunner), this also happens when the similarly gold-plated Corus (Ilana's mech form) is cleaned off with water and also sparkles.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures_ and _Animaniacs_ used this a lot, _Animaniacs_ especially (like whenever Minerva Mink and Hello Nurse were around).
-   The same sexy saxophone riff shows up in all of MGM's golden age cartoons whenever an attractive female shows up, like _Tom and Jerry_ and shorts by Tex Avery.
