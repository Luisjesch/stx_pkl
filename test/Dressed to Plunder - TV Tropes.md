_"With all those peg legs, hook hands and eye patches, it's like these movies are trying to tell us that pirates, more so than any other group of people in history, were remarkably good at misplacing body parts."_

In fiction, most Pirates are easily identifiable by their Stock Costume Traits.

Expect to see some combination of the following:

-   A tricorner hat, bicorner hat (as seen in the page image), cavalier hat, or a bandana wrapped around their head. Occasionally decorated with a Jolly Roger.
-   Artificial Limbs, like a Hook Hand or a Seadog Peg Leg.
-   Eyepatches.
-   A Pirate Parrot, perched on a shoulder. (And it's surprisingly common for the parrot to sport its own miniature hat and/or eyepatch.)
-   Buckles, bandoliers and sashes.
-   Vests or naval jackets.
-   Either a rough Seadog Beard or a layer of Permastubble. One or two per crew may sport an exquisite mustache.
-   Gold hoop earrings and/or a gold tooth.
-   Cutlasses and pistols as weapons.
-   Tall cavalier boots. Worn folded down to the knee gives them "bucket" tops and is the classic buccaneer look. Worn unfolded to thigh height is often associated with female pirates in particular.
-   Alternately, shoes with large buckles, or no footwear at all (said to give better foothold on deck and in the rigging than hard leather shoe soles).

In most cases, no one individual will have every trait — they'll be spread around the whole crew, for variety. Expect the captain to get a fancier suit (perhaps a Badass Longcoat of the _justacorps_ style) and the most impressive hat; crew members are more likely to wear a bandana, breeches, and a simple shirt (often striped). The most overt examples will be emblazoned with a skull and crossbones. Bonus points if they also Talk Like a Pirate. _Extra_ bonus points if they go by a name like Captain Colorbeard or Long John Shout Out.

As can be seen in the Friendly Pirate trope, this look is sufficient to qualify someone as a Pirate even if they don't engage in any other piratical activity.

This image of pirates can pretty much be traced directly to Robert Louis Stevenson, who single-handedly codified the parrot and peg-leg image with Long John Silver (despite him not having a peg leg). (The hook was popularized later by _Peter Pan_'s Captain Hook.)

That's not to say it has _no_ basis in reality, with some notorious Real Life pirates wearing parts of the ensemble. Edward "Blackbeard" Teach, for instance, got his trope-naming moniker from his Beard of Barbarism, and due to the primitiveness of medicine at the time it was common to see sailors with missing appendages (amputation being a comparatively safer solution to severe limb injuries than trying to let it heal in one piece). The eyepatch was also common, partly because actual eye injuries were not unheard of.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  People who lived from plunder and had no fixed home were also expected to carry their ill-gotten wealth on themselves as gold coins and jewellery, or gold coins beaten into jewellery.

Subtrope of Pirate, of course. Often seen in Gangplank Galleon.

    Advertising 

-   In an ad for FreeCreditReport.com, a man sings the jingle; in his story, his credit went to hell and now he has to work as a singing waiter in a pirate-themed restaurant.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Captain Harlock_ wears an eyepatch, a black naval jacket marked with the skull and crossbones, along with an enormous cape and boots. He also carries a pistol and something that's a cross between a cutlass and a really long pistol but keeps a strange long-necked bird in lieu of a parrot. His crew mostly wears striped shirts and bandanas, while sorta-sister-in-law Emeraldas wears a red version of Harlock's outfit.
-   Captain Ash and his crew in _Mobile Suit Gundam AGE_ dress like this in a Space Pirates kind of way. Ash's Dark Hound Gundam even has a pirate hat with a skull-and-crossbones with a targeting mechanism that _looks like an eyepatch_.
-   _One Piece_, being a manga about pirates can't miss out on that trope — although mostly these traits are spread around the minor, generic pirates while major pirate characters tend to look more distinct. Still, there are a couple examples:
    -   The Pirate King Gol D. Roger resembled a stereotypical pirate with his bicorner hat, naval coat, and mustache. He also dual-wielded a sword and a gun at one point.
    -   Blackbeard, who adopts an increasingly stereotypically pirate look as the series goes on (but manages to make it look imposing and terrifying). In particular he grows his beard out from a stubble to full size and adds a bunch of jewelry and a billowing black coat when joining the Seven Warlords.
    -   Of the main characters, Zoro probably dresses closest to the (non-captain) stereotype, with the bandana he wears on his head while fighting. Though, series creator Eiichiro Oda uses the most famous elements _very_ sparingly: thus far there's only been one Hook Hand (Crocodile), one Seadog Peg Leg (Zeff - unless one counts Shiki, who replaced _both_ his legs with swords), and one eyepatch (one of the piranha from Buggy's cover story; Oda later said this was the element he most consciously avoided using throughout the series, because he planned to put it on a character at the _very_ end).
-   Lalaco Godspeed of _Space Patrol Luluco_ dresses like Captain Morgan with an enormous bicorn hat bearing the skull-and-crossbones, an 18th-century-style naval jacket, and high-heeled bucket-topped boots (and almost nothing else).
-   _Berserk_ had a crew of pirates led by a captain who even in-universe is described as the spitting image of a stereotypical pirate. He's armed with a cutlass, has a sinister-looking beard, wears a bicorn hat, an eyepatch, a fancy long-flowing coat, and has a Seadog Peg Leg, though, in an added bit of realism, he also has to use a crutch to get around. Hilariously and despite all this, he insists that he is _not_ a pirate but a legitimate merchant since he has given up on raiding and now makes a living selling goods legally (said goods being captured Kushan children as slaves). He also demands his crew refer to him as "Boss" and reacts violently when they call him "Captain."

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_ foe Captain Stingaree sports an eyepatch, earring, neckerchief, long naval frock coat, buccaneer boots, and cutlass.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics):_ Captain Metal (or, as he'd pronounce it, Cap'n Metal), a rebuilt Metal Sonic who turned pirate overlord, is designed to look like a typical pirate, with requisite eyepatch, peg-leg, and tricorn. No parrot, though.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   Vol 1: In the Golden Age/Earth-Two Diana and Etta Candy's Holliday Girls fought some sky pirates who dressed in bandanas and piraty hats and such.
    -   Vol 2: Di adopts leather pants and corset with an oversized jacket paired with big golden hooped earrings and a bandana tied around her head as the head of a rebellion labeled as pirates, and partakes in piracy stealing slaves, ships and other goods from the Sangtee Empire on a large scale. She's freeing the slaves and using those goods to provide for them.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Pearls Before Swine_:
    -   In one series, a stereotypical pirate cries at the FBI's anti-piracy warnings. The same pirate is also seen running a dry-cleaning service. (He's not very good at it.)
    -   In January 2015, Rat decides to be a pirate.
        
        **Goat:** What are you doing?  
        **Rat:** I'm Pirate Boy. From now on, I'm living my life as a pirate.  
        **Goat:** Yeah, well, pirates were more than eyepatches and hats.  
        

    Films — Animated 

-   The pirates in _Ice Age: Continental Drift_ can pull off this look without actually wearing any clothes. For example, Captain Gutt is a giant ape whose fur looks like a tricorner hat and a cape.
-   Being that it's _Treasure Island_ in SPACE!, _Treasure Planet_'s John Silver has fantastic versions of the key trope components: a Swiss-Army Appendage instead of a hook, a happy-go-lucky shape-shifting blob in place of a parrot, etc.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Silent film _The Black Pirate_ could not play this any straighter. Peg legs. Pirate parrots. Bandana hats. Permastubble. The works.
-   In _Down Periscope_, the captain is told early on that the war game he's taking part in is designed to simulate asymmetrical warfare and he should, therefore, "think like a pirate". Sure enough, when the crew decide to make The Neidermeyer executive officer Walk the Plank, they dress the part using bits of their Navy uniforms — fake pirate hats, eyepatches, black marker for beards. One of them even has a frozen chicken attached to his shoulder as a "parrot".
-   _Fast Times at Ridgemont High_: Brad ends up working at a pirate-themed restaurant and realized how low his life has sunk when he catches a look at himself in his own rearview mirror making a delivery dressed as a pirate.
-   _Muppet Treasure Island_, being based on the trope codifier, naturally follows this motif. Long John is particularly resplendent once he shows his true colors.
-   The _Pirates of the Caribbean_ series puts its own spin on the costumes, but still hits the major notes: parrot, beards, eyepatches, hats, bandanas, everything short of a hook (although Davy Jones's crab-claw creates a similar effect) and peg leg (again, Jones's crab leg invokes the image of one, and Barbossa gets a proper one in the fourth movie).

    Literature 

-   Alex from _Almost Night_ had his spirit bonded to an ancient pirate, and so he talks like a pirate and uses pirate weaponry such as a cutlass and a flintlock pistol. He wears an eye patch, but it's just for show since both of his eyes function just fine.
-   An Invoked Trope by the Space Pirates in the _Bio of a Space Tyrant_ series by Piers Anthony, since the authorities won't believe (or don't want to admit to) ancient-looking pirates operating in space.
-   The _Peter and the Starcatchers_ series plays off of _Peter Pan_, so of course the characters are similarly depicted.
-   _Peter Pan_'s pirates had a heavy influence on the trope. Most notably, Captain Hook popularized the Hook Hand look.
-   Gideon Defoe's _The Pirates_ books use these as the only identifiers for the otherwise nameless characters — the Pirate Captain, the pirate with the wooden leg, the pirate with the hook, etc. In the movie, one of the pirates has a wooden nose.
-   _The Pyrates_ manages to hit every major pirate stereotype. This includes all variations of the standard pirate outfit.
-   In _Rocko The Christmas Bat_, one of the children from the main family goes trick-or-treating as a pirate, with a jacket and eye-patch get-up.
-   _Roys Bedoys_: In “Roys Bedoys’s Spectacular Halloween Zoom Party!”, Maker wears a pirate hat and a striped shirt for Halloween.
-   _Samurai Scarecrow_: One of Yukio's Ninja friends dressed as a pirate for Halloween. This involves pirate pants, a peg leg, and an eyepatch.
-   _Treasure Island_ is the Trope Codifier thanks to Captain Long John Silver. He's got a parrot and is missing a leg, though the original and some of the adaptations don't give him a peg leg, he just hobbles around on a crutch. The pegleg at the knee (when Silver's amputation is said to be much higher) is probably an example of Pragmatic Adaptation, from multiple stage and screen adaptations — it's much easier to mock up on an able-bodied actor than a whole missing leg.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Subverted for Laughs on _Arrested Development_ when Tobias wears one of his wife's blouses and gets on a boat filled with what he thinks are pirates. It's actually a Gay Rights protest.
-   The staff of Piratz Tavern on _Bar Rescue_.
-   Downplayed very slightly in _Black Sails_, which aims for a more historically accurate Darker and Edgier angle than most Pirate media (despite mixing fictional characters from _Treasure Island_ with real-life pirates). This approach means less of the more stylized aspects of this trope, so there's little if anything in the way of skull-and-crossbone motifs, eyepatches, hooks, gold teeth, or parrots... but still plenty of cutlasses, flintlocks, nice hats, Badass Longcoats, big shirts, and assorted beard and mustache styles to go around. Eventually Long John Silver loses a leg and replaces it with a prosthetic (later swapping it for a crutch).
-   In an episode of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, Xander dresses up as a stereotypical pirate for Halloween.
-   _Doctor Who_. In "Legend of the Sea Devils" the Doctor and Yaz are, for once, dressed in period-accurate costume...except for Dan whom Yaz encouraged to dress like a pantomime pirate as a joke. Fortunately the pirates they encounter are Chinese, who no doubt assume he's just a strangely-dressed foreigner.
-   _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_ and _Power Rangers Super Megaforce_ blend this with Toku spandex — the suits are styled like jackets, the helmets are designed to look like bicorns (or a bandana in Silver's case), and the usual Sword and Gun sidearms are a cutlass and flintlock.
-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_: Long John Silver appears as the introductory act for the pixilated-motion diversions in the "Confuse-a-Cat" sketch, though with a full missing leg and a crutch rather than the adaptational peg leg.
    
    **Silver:** _(thump thump thump)_ My lords, ladies and Gedderbong. _(pops out of existence)_
    
-   John Cleese appears as one of these in a season 2 episode of _The Muppet Show_ (observe).
-   Done by, of all people, George Harrison on _Rutland Weekend Television_; he keeps appearing dressed this way in anticipation of the pirate sketch later in the show. The fact there is no pirate sketch does not deter him.
-   _Whodunnit? (UK)_: In "Which Eye Jack", a murder occurs among a gathering of pirates. All of the suspects fit this trope to some degree, with Blackbeard being the most complete example, dressed in a tricorner hat, frock coat, Eyepatch of Power, Hook Hand, and Seadog Peg Leg. Capatin Magee, the sole Pirate Girl at the gathering, rocks a tight Waistcoat of Style, flouncy shirt, Painted-On Pants, and thigh-high boots.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Pirata Morgan, veteran of EMLL, as well as All Japan Pro Wrestling, FMW, Lucha Libre Internacional and AAA. The eye patches and half masks aren't just for show though, he did lose an eye in a match.
-   IWRG and CMLL wrestler Sable tended to dress himself like a pirate.
-   Kairi Hojo had swashbuckler-inspired entrance attire in Wonder Ring STARDOM, which she wore prior to winning the World Of title belt, which had been vacant for a month in 2015.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _7th Sea_ naturally uses this trope, as it is by and large set in a world centered on Wooden Ships and Iron Men.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The _Complete Adventurer_ sourcebook for 3.5 edition includes rules for a "Dread Pirate" prestige class, accompanied by an illustration of a swashbuckling pirate sporting the standard beard, bandana, loose breeches, and Badass Longcoat.
-   _Forgotten Waters_ puts players in the shoes of a crew of pirates, so naturally the game art for all PC standees (and the NPC captains) depicts them all decked out with some combination of blunderbusses, admiral's jackets, ammo bandoliers, cutlasses, excessive buckles, bandanas, peg legs/ hook hands, eye patches, stripy pants, feathered tricornes, and cavalier boots.
-   Games Workshop games:
    -   One of the Maneater models from _Warhammer_ and _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_ is dressed in traditional pirate garb complete with tricorn hat, longcoat (worn as an open vest due to being too small to fit the size of the ogre/ogor), cutlass, brace of pistols and parrot costumed Gnobler/Grot.
    -   The Ork Freebooterz of _Warhammer 40,000_ wear pirate hats.
    -   In _Rogue Trader_, most of the official art draws little if any difference between "Officer of an Imperial Vessel" and "Space Pirate", especially the titular Rogue Trader and the Arch-Militant careers. Then again, about the only thing that separates you from said space pirates is you have a Warrant of Trade.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Ramirez DePietro has the standard eyepatch.

    Toys 

-   Captain Redbeard<small>◊</small> from the LEGO Pirates line could be the page picture if he had a Hook Hand.

    Video Games 

-   _Borderlands 2_: Captain Scarlett dresses as you would expect, complete with a hook hand; about the only things that aren't fairly typical are a bionic eye standing in for an eyepatch, and slightly more modern piercings than most pirates. Of note, the hook hand is in a game where multiple characters (Gaige, Sir Hammerlock, and Wilhelm, to name just three) have fully functional bionic limbs; Scarlett is apparently so dedicated to the aesthetic that she's willing to overlook that.
-   _Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle_: Morgane's childhood home actually has a rack of peg legs, left from prominent pirate ancestors. Also, one of the crew members Morgane recruits makes it a condition of the hire that she buy him a gold earring so that he can look the part of a pirate.
-   _Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest_: The whole Kremling Krew adopts this visual, meaning every crocodilian enemy ends up with a gratuitous amount of bandanas, bicorne hats, hoop earrings, and peg legs. Some even use Hook Hands as boomerang projectiles.
-   _Don't Starve: Shipwrecked_: Woodlegs has, as the name suggests, _two_ wooden legs, on top of a bicorne hat and a Seadog Beard.
-   _Dungeon Defenders_: This is an alternate outfit for the Squire in the Halloween 2011 Costume Pack DLC.
-   _Final Fantasy_: Pirates often dress like this:
    -   _Final Fantasy_: Bikke is the Badass Longcoat captain with bicorn and beard, while his crew have bandannas and eyepatches.
    -   _Final Fantasy II_: Leila wears a bandanna; her crew has that and eyepatches.
    -   _Final Fantasy V_: Faris has a Badass Longcoat and a Sailor's Ponytail in the concept art, although her sprite looks different, and her crew look the same as all the others. Also, the Cannoneer job uses this kind of clothing (although you can call it a navy outfit, too), and the Skeleton enemies in the Ship Graveyard have bandannas and — somehow — beards.
    -   In _Crystal Chronicles Ring Of Fates_ and _Echoes Of Time_, Selkies can equip pirate hats and coats.
    -   _Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light_: Drake's pirates have stripey shirts and bandannas; Drake himself has the bicorn and beard but is otherwise dressed the same.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIV_: As one of the three major cities is nautically themed, it's not much of a surprise that many of its residents dress the part (including the faction leader). Player characters can piece together the Buccaneer gear for a similar look.
-   _Fire Emblem_: The field and battle sprites for the Pirate class have bandannas. Most recruitable pirates have them too. Exceptions are Geese from _Binding Blade_ (who has a Badass Longcoat) and Briggid from _Genealogy of the Holy War_, who was a pirate captain by profession but a Sniper by class.
-   _Five Nights at Freddy's_: Foxy is dressed like a traditional buccaneer, though not a captain (presumably, Freddy being the leader of the animatronics means he outranks Foxy). Foxy features a hook for a right hand, an eyepatch, several gold teeth, and muzzle markings resembling stubble. His lower legs and left hand are damaged and bare, revealing the endoskeleton beneath, which also evoke either more artificial limbs on a person or the skeletal Ghost Pirate motif. It's not totally clear if Mangle in _Five Nights at Freddy's 2_ also adheres to the pirate theme despite being in the "Kids' Cove", as by the time of the game they're simply a mess of metal parts. Nonetheless, they are missing the white of one eye in an echo of an eyepatch (and the glowing yellow light within suggests an undead appearance). Likewise, they feature a smaller, extra head that fanon speculates might belong to a Pirate Parrot when Mangle is in working order.
-   _Ginger Beyond The Crystal_: One of the outfits Ginger can wear is a pirate's outfit. It includes a tri-corner hat, an eyepatch, and a coat.
-   _Joumee The Hedgehog_: You can put a pirate hat on Joumee to wear in the game.
-   _League of Legends_: Gangplank is easily identifiable as a pirate by his hat, beard, red naval jacket, and piratical Sword and Gun combo. Several other characters have pirate-themed alternate costumes as well: the Bilgerat Rumble, Bilgewater Katarina, Pirate Ryze, Bilgewater Swain, and Fiddle Me Timbers skins all include stock pirate visual cues.
-   _The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night_: The Skavengers, a large crew of Sky Pirates, all wear eyepatches, earrings and bandanas, and fight with cutlasses. Higher-ranking members also wear black bicorne hats adorned with skull designs.
-   _Metroid_: The game manual artwork shows the Space Pirates as aliens sporting this outfit. This is Early-Installment Weirdness, as all later _Metroid_ games portray them as humanoid arthropods with some basic armor at most.
-   _Monkey Island_: Despite protagonist Guybrush Threepwood being a self-proclaimed "Mighty Pirate™", he mostly averts the trope himself, whereas all other pirate characters (and many who are not pirates at all!) play it perfectly straight.
    -   In _The Secret of Monkey Island_, "Pirate Wannabe" Guybrush barely has any of the classic pirate attire, with the possible exception of multiple shiny buttons holding his pants up, and a pair of buckled shoes.
    -   In _Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge_, Guybrush moves closer to the trope, having acquired a tattered, navy-blue captain's jacket that is way too big for him and looks like it was stolen off a long-dead corpse. He also wears the folded-down cavalier boots, a large belt buckle, and a buckled baldric that appears to serve no purpose whatsoever.
    -   Despite becoming a bona-fide pirate captain during _The Curse of Monkey Island_, Guybrush's attire actually takes a step _back_ from the trope. He now wears a puffy shirt but no jacket, a sash instead of a fancy belt, and pretty much the same socks and shoes he wore in the first game. The following games in the series zig-zag some more, but essentially remain within the confines set by the previous games.
    -   Guybrush's archnemesis, the undead pirate LeChuck, plays the trope almost perfectly straight, with the exception of artificial limbs (he's undead, after all). His Seadog Beard — which tends to flutter regardless of wind conditions — actually becomes a quest item when Guybrush keeps it after defeating LeChuck for the first time. In the second game, Guybrush and LeChuck are dressed almost the same (with different colors and LeChuck's signature skull-and-crossbones bicorn notwithstanding) - possibly Foreshadowing the revelation that they are brothers.
    -   Decidedly non-pirate characters in partial or full pirate attire practically litter each of the games. They include salesmen and shopkeepers, bartenders, military personnel, a cartographer, and at least one child (Kenny).
    -   The trope is exaggerated intentionally with Meathook, an ex-pirate with _two_ hook hands, an eyepatch, and a huge skull tattoo on his chest that he can make talk like a ventriloquist. He also owns a parrot who is apparently too vicious to let out of its cage/strongbox (that's how Meathook lost his hands, after all).
-   _Moshi Monsters_: Most of the pirates dress like this.
    -   Octopeg has a pirate hat and six peg legs (he's an octopus).
    -   Captain Buck has a pirate hat.
    -   Captain Codswallop wears a pirate hat, gloves, an earring, and a monocle.
    -   Mr Mushy Peas wears a bandana and a peg leg (also 3D glasses for some reason).
    -   Jaunty Jack wears a paper hat and an eyepatch.
    -   Pirate Pong wears an eyepatch.
    -   Handy Van Hookz has hooks for both hands and a pirate hat.
    -   McScruff has a bandana.
-   _Pizza Vs. Skeletons_: You can buy a pirate hat and eyepatch with in-game money to make the pizza wear. Also, one of the bosses is a giant skull with a pirate bandanna and an earring.
-   _Pokémon Unite_ has Holowear for the various Pokemon you can use in the game; Captain style Cinderace dresses like this with a bicorne hat and naval jacket, which provides a nice contrast with Greninja.

-   _RuneScape_: All of the stock traits appear on various pirate NPCs: bandanas, tricorner hats, eyepatches, a hook-hand, a captain's hat with a skull-and-crossbones on it, etc. Most of them are also available as wearable equipment, and there is a parrot...well, a zombie parrot ("ex-ex-parrot") available as a pet as a reward for a pirate-related quest.
-   _Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew_: All of the pirates incorporate elements of the typical pirate costume. We see eyepatches, peg legs, long beards, and at least one Hook Hand among the crew. Suleidy's costume includes a Jolly Roger flag crafted into a cloak. And several pirates have tricorn hats.
-   _Skies of Arcadia_ plays with this trope adding fantasy elements to it. Vyse has a glass eye-patch that can be used to zoom in, Drachma has a robotic arm (that has a hook-like add-on), Guilder has his pet parrot (called Willy), the ensemble cast is covered with large jackets, buckles, and stripes, and after finishing the game Fina changes her clothes to this with her Living Weapon gaining a standard eye-patch.
-   _Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves_: Invoked when Sly has to obtain an eyepatch, peg leg, and hat to impersonate Contagious Tim when trying to get the location of Remy Lousteau's diving gear from Black Spot Pete.
-   _Team Fortress 2_: The Demoman has an eyepatch by default, but the "Swashbuckler's Swag" outfit adds a peg-leg, a bottle of rum, and a captain's bicorne with piratey Flavor Text. Also of note are the Rimmed Raincatcher hat and the Soldier's Brawling Buccaneer outfit.
-   _Warcraft_:
    -   _Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness_: The boxart features Mirrored Confrontation Shot with a human in a coat and tricorn hat while the orc opposite has a bandanna and earrings, to advertise the game's newly added naval combat. Despite this, other piratical elements like Talk Like a Pirate are absent.
    -   _World of Warcraft_:
-   _Wario Land_: The pirates in the various games all share parts of these traits.
    -   Captain Syrup, Wario's recurring pirate nemesis, wears baggy pantaloons, a skull belt buckle, a small top, and a bandanna over her long hair.
    -   _Wario Land 3_: Jamano the Ghost Pirate wears a ragged green robe and a red bicorne hat marked with crossed cutlasses.
    -   _Wario Land 4_: Captain Coin Ghost Pirate is a floating skull with a bicorne hat and a hook hand.
    -   _Wario World_: Captain Skull has this look, except with a giant cannon in place of one hand and a grappling hook for the other. And while those three are the ones with the most traditional pirate garb, even the other pirates in the series have them to some degree.
    -   _Wario Land: Shake It!_: Badineros have the bandanas and cutlasses and the Shake King looks like a mix between a pirate, a biking, and a traditional Evil Overlord.

    Web Animation 

-   Russell, the pirate sea otter from _Happy Tree Friends_, has a Jolly Roger hat, an eyepatch, a hook hand, and two peg legs.
-   _Monkey Wrench_: Several members of Queen Tyneen's crew of Space Pirates dress like stereotypical buccaneers: her right-hand man Ricket wears a bandana, as do her mass-produced Fodder underlings, and they all wield Energy Weapons that look like guns from the Age of Sail. Tyneen herself bears few of the stereotypical pirate traits, though she _does_ have a Swiss-Army Appendage of a cybernetic left hand.
-   _Plan 3_: The cursed pirate looks like your average pirate captain, since the Chinese Food Curse only affects a person's luck and not their appearance.

    Web Original 

-   _The Last Trumpet:_ Zigzagged by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who mix modern attempts at traditional pirate wear with Buccaneers logowear.

-   When Sonya, one of the resident ditzes of _Ménage à 3_, needs an eye patch to protect a black eye, she ends up buying a complete pirate costume — albeit that it turns out to be a sexy pirate outfit. She then insists on wearing it while playing seductive mind-games with other cast members.
-   _Rusty and Co._ has Plaidbeard, a rare hatless example. Notably, his crew is dressed in the standard breeches/bandana/stripy shirt.
-   When _Something\*Positive_'s characters celebrate Talk Like a Pirate Day, they wear standard pirate costumes.

-   _Pirates SMP_: In the Twitter character announcement posters, most of the cast are decked out in various degrees of stereotypical pirate gear, including hats or bandannas, eyepatches, ruffles on shirts, longcoats or vests, buckles and belts, jewelry, and either swords or pistols as weapons. A handful of the cast even have birds as companion animals in the series itself, including parrots in a couple of cases.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Animaniacs_, there is Evil Cap'n Mel, in _Animaniacs Episode 3_ "HMS Yakko." He wears a bicorn hat, has a hook for a right hand and is extremely short since _both_ legs are peg-legs below the knee. In his appearance, he pushes his entire crew overboards, after saying it's something he does "hardly ever."
-   In _Captain Pugwash_, Captain Pugwash sports a bicorn hat with a skull-and-crossbones on the front; a mustache; a naval jacket; a flouncy shirt; and cavakier boots. His Arch-Enemy Cut-Throat Jake has a badass bandana; an Eyepatch of Power; a Seadog Beard; a waist sash; and buccaneer boots.
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_ features the candy-themed pirate villain Stickybeard, who wears an eyepatch, a black hat with a skull on it, a Blackbeard-style beard (with candy stuck in it), and a peg-leg and hook-hand both made from candy canes.
-   Youngblood of _Danny Phantom_ is seen in full hook-and-pegleg regalia, complete with skull-and-crossbones hat.
-   _The Dragon Prince_ gives us Villads, (the "D" is silent) who while retired, is still dressed like a typical pirate with a Seadog Beard, pirate hat, two eyepatches, and of course a Pirate Parrot.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_: In one of the _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_ shorts, Cosmo and Wanda dress up in the traditional garb while playing pirate.
-   _Futurama_'s Space Pirates dress this way, with accommodations for their Bizarre Alien Biology — one pirate has three peg-legs, two eyepatches, and parrots on three of his four shoulders.
-   The _Garfield's Halloween Adventure_ has him and Odie going out Trick-or-Treating dressed as pirates, Garfield wearing a pirate hat and sporting a peg leg, while Odie has a bandana, single earring, and striped shirt, and being who he is, starts off with a peg on every leg. Later they run into some ghostly pirates who show more of the usual fashion sense, just more dead and decayed.
-   In one _Muppet Babies_ Imagine Spot, the gang finds themselves talking to a crew of pirates, and when one of them demands to know whose crew they're on, they say they're Nanny's crew. Gonzo then goes a bit overboard in describing her as a great pirate, with a patch over both eyes, two hook hands, and two peg legs.
-   An episode of _Rocko's Modern Life_ featured a pirate who had wooden legs, wooden _arms_ and wooden _eyes_!
-   The _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "Nightmare Night" gives us the foal Pipsqueak, presently presenting as a pirate for trick-or-treating, with a jacket, head bandana, eyepatch, and toy cutlass.
-   The season 2 premier of _The Owl House_ has Luz, Eda, and an entire group of sailors all wearing pirate themed outfits, though technically Eda is the only one who does any actual piracy (the rest of them basically being government sanctioned whalers). Eda's outfit in the epilogue also has heavy pirate inspirations, complete with a Hook Hand. In fact, it's highly likely that she chose the hook over a more articulate prosthesis solely for the excuse of being able to dress up that way.
-   One of _PAW Patrol_'s villains, Sid Swashbuckle, wears a tricorner hat, bandana, jacket, and gold belt buckle.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_: In "Mizzen in Action", a crew of predictably-dressed pirates accidentally imbibe some Chemical X to become the Villains of the Week.
-   _The Simpsons_: Shown on the cover of _Treasure Island_ that Bart tries to BS his way through a book report of.
    
    _Well, as Mrs. Krabappel already mentioned, the name of the book that I read was_ Treasure Island_. It's about these pirates,_ (looks at the illustrated cover of the book) _pirates with patches over their eyes,_ (looks at cover) _and shiny gold teeth,_ (looks at cover) _and green birds on their shoulders. Did I mention this book was written_ (looks at cover) _by a guy named Robert Louis Stevenson?_ (looks at cover) _And published by the good people at McGraw-Hill. So, in conclusion, on the Simpson scale of one to ten — ten being the highest, one being the lowest and five being average — I give this book a nine._
    
-   _Spongebob Squarepants_:
    -   Patchy the Pirate and the Flying Dutchman.
    -   In "Aargh!", Mr. Krabs goes treasure hunting with SpongeBob and Patrick dressed in fancy pirate captain duds and gives his two underlings some pirate wear to match. SpongeBob puts on two peg legs and calls himself Peggy the Pirate, while Patrick wears eyepatches on both eyes as Blindbeard the Pirate.
