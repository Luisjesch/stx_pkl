In this variation, a man harnesses The Power of Blood to attempt to rejuvenate his music career.

A character, typically evil or sadistic, immersed in a bathtub filled with blood. Frequently, any blood used for this purpose will be a type of Applied Phlebotinum that is intended to cause some fantastic effect on the bather.

The Trope Maker derives from legends surrounding the Hungarian "Blood Countess" Elizabeth Báthory, a Serial Killer who purportedly bathed in the blood of young women (specifically virgins, according to some accounts) in order to restore her beauty and youth. While the _real_ Countess Báthory was accused of many gruesome acts, it's certain that her baths in blood are only the stuff of fiction. However, the Blood Bath is very much a key component to be found in any story in which she is featured, and any stories that feature a Blood Bath without Báthory as a character will often allude to her motives for doing this (lifted directly from the legends) and may also mention her by name (or, at least, give a character partaking in this a similar-sounding name as a Shout-Out).

The trope can often follow the Rule of Symbolism to deliver a moral tract about the evils of vanity and Immortality Immorality.

Characters who bathe in blood often exhibit other qualities closely associated with vampirism, especially when alluding to blood being rejuvenating or how they come to acquire their blood in the first place; Blood Lust and fangs can be commonly noticed as well. In cases not involving outright vampiric entities, characters may be dabbling in The Dark Arts, especially Blood Magic.

A less common, but much older, variant of the trope takes after the story of the warrior Siegfried from the _Nibelungenlied_, whose body was made invulnerable after bathing in the blood of a dragon.

This trope is **NOT** to be associated with instances where bloody corpses are found in bathtubs or any kind of small body of water, like in Bath Suicide or any grisly murders in bathrooms (unless the blood from the victim(s) of said tropes is used for _someone else_ to bathe in, of course).

Compare: Blood Is the New Black, where a character ends up covered in gore as a result of fighting.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Based on both the Elizabeth Bathory legend and Vlad the Impaler, one of the scariest villains of _Ghost Hunt_ was a Japanese lord who bathed in the blood of numerous servants in the hope of extending his life and took up the moniker "Urado" (Vlad). It's implied that the power of Urado's multiple Human Sacrifices <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  has preserved the spirit of Urado and his two attendants/accomplices in an unending loop of kidnapping and sacrifice even after Urado is no longer alive to benefit from it.
-   In _Golion_, the evil witch Honerva bathes her cat in blood (although it's called a "lava bath" in _Voltron_).
-   In the Korean Manhwa _Horror Collector_, the protagonist seeks to resurrect Elizabeth Bathory from a doll that she had apparently sealed her spirit inside of through one of her blood bathing rituals. Bathory herself is shown to be surprisingly compassionate, despite bathing in the blood of her victims.
-   Inverted in _Overlord (2012)_. Shalltear Bloodfallen normally appears as an Elegant Gothic Lolita, but when she bathes in blood, her glamor breaks and she turns into what can best be described as a humanoid lamprey abomination.
-   Dubhe Siegfried of _Saint Seiya_ (Anime only) shares his Achilles' Heel with his namesake from the _Nibelungenlied_— he slays a dragon and bathes in its blood, making himself invulnerable, but at that very moment, a tiny leaf falls on his back (coincidentally over his heart), preventing that bit of skin from being touched by the blood, and therefore making that spot the only part of his body that can be dealt a mortal blow.
-   In _Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust_, the spirit of the main antagonist, Carmilla, is brought back to her physical body by bathing her corpse in Charlotte's blood.
-   In _YuYu Hakusho_, it's revealed in a flashback that the Black Book Club bathed in the blood of the innocent demons they had slaughtered, mostly For the Evulz. The discovery of this (as well as several other factors) drove Shinobu Sensui batshit insane.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   Garth Ennis wrote a comic (_Legends of the Dark Knight_ #91-93) in which the villain, Doctor Freak, was a drug lord who got people hooked on a drug so he could kill them, fill a pool with their drugged-up blood, and get high by bathing in it.
    -   In _Batman: The Cult_, Deacon Blackfire bathed in blood, supposedly to make himself immortal.
-   _Black Panther_ foe Man-Ape gained his Super-Strength by eating the flesh and bathing in the blood of a rare white gorilla.
-   Readers first meet Solomon Ravne from _Caballistics, Inc._ in the middle of one such bath, surrounded by the naked, bleeding corpses the blood had to have come from. Because Ravne is suggested to be Really 700 Years Old, it may be that such a bath is needed to maintain his age and appearance or prolong his life.
-   The Journey to the Center of the Mind one-shot _Carnage: It's A Wonderful Life_ has a sequence where Carnage (wearing swim trunks, goggles, and a bathing cap) is shown high-diving into a luxury pool filled with blood, as two babes cheer him on.
-   In _Conan the Barbarian_, when the malicious King Numedides expressed a desire to become immortal, he enlisted the services of the Evil Sorcerer Thulandra Thuu, and together, they sacrificed young women in order for Numedides to bathe in their blood.
-   One group of people infected by the Hate Plague in _Crossed_ take to soaking themselves in blood, doing it so often that their skin begins turning a faint shade of red. The character who informs the others about this tribe then goes on to recount having stumbled onto a "party" in which the infected filled an empty pool by shredding people with woodchippers and lawnmowers they had aimed at it.
-   Elizabeth Bathory was a very minor adversary in Marvel Comics' _Dracula Lives!_. Originally, Dracula intended to make Bathory his vampiric servant, but her baths in the blood of virgins had made her immune to Dracula's control, so they briefly agreed to form an alliance. When Bathory finally betrayed Dracula, he ended up stealing her journals and turning them in to the authorities, which led to her being sealed in a room in her castle as punishment. Dracula later confronted Bathory in her cell and drained her of all her blood; she aged to death in seconds.
-   Emily Christy of _Hack/Slash_ resorts to something akin to this in order to retain a human appearance in _Tub Club_, manipulating students into weird bloodletting pool orgies as a part of being in the titular secret society. Cassie is also depicted as partaking in one on a cover<small>◊</small> from the same Story Arc.
-   _Hellboy: Wake the Devil_ references the original legend about Elizabeth Bathory. The blood baths are only mentioned, not shown, but the iron maiden that was used to obtain the blood plays a pivotal role in the plot.
-   A _Judge Dredd_ strip published in _Judge Dredd Mega Special 1995_ concerns a pop singer who retained his youth and good looks through The Dark Arts, human sacrifice, and bathing in blood—the literal blood bath being implied to be the most crucial step in the singer's rejuvenation rituals. Strangely enough, 22nd Century technology in Dredd's world has made several means of rejuvenation (including some that are legal) readily available to Mega-City One citizens, which makes it a bit odd to see somebody taking this route, instead.
-   One chapter of the _2000 AD_ strip _A Love Like Blood_ features the vampire king Karkossa lounging in what appears to be a blood _jacuzzi_ while also being entertained by female vampires.
-   _Nikolai Dante_'s invitation to a gathering of the Cadre Infernale led to him meeting the High Priestess of the order, Camilla Le Fanu, bathing in what Nikolai at first thought was red wine. She alludes to the rejuvenating effects of Blood Baths being discovered by Bathory but insists that, unlike Bathory, she gets her blood from young women who are _willing_ to donate a few pints in exchange for a tax exemption. However, it turns out that jobless women who can't pay taxes are bled for all they got.
-   This is the main gimmick of _Teen Titans_ villain Brother Blood, a supervillain cult leader who bathes in the blood of his followers to prolong his life (although not indefinitely).
-   In _Warlord of Mars_ #17, Commandant Keisari, military commander of the Vathek (a race of vampires who dwell on Saturn), is shown bathing in a tub that is being filled from draining corpses suspended above it.

    Music Videos 

-   Eminem is seen taking one such bath in the video for his single "3 A.M."
-   The video for Supergrass's single "Mary" parodies the "video nasties" of the 1970s and 80s. At one point a woman is in a bath when the pipes on the wall start to rattle and spew blood, the bath is soon overflowing with blood, and the drain tries to suck her in.
-   MILGRAM: In the music video for Mikoto's song "MeMe", he (or, at least, his evil Split Personality) is shown bathing after killing his victims. The first couple of times, he's showering normally and washing blood off him, but the third and final time, he is shown shirtless in a bathtub full of blood.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Poet Peter of Eboli alleged that Court of Norman member Matthew of Ajello attempted to cure his gout by washing his feet in the blood of children.
-   According to Christian legend, when Roman Emperor Constantine I contracted leprosy, the pagan priests told him to bathe in the blood of babies as a cure. Refusing to do this, he allegedly sought counsel from Pope Sylvester I, who cured him. This legend is the background for the Donation of Constantine, now shown to be a forgery, which purported to grant the entire Western Empire to the papacy.
-   In rabbinic tradition, the Pharaoh of Egypt from Exodus (the first one, not the one Moses famously confronts) is said to have contracted leprosy and treated it by bathing in the blood of Israelite babies, ordering one baby a day killed for this purpose.
-   In _The Bible_, some translations of 1st Kings 22:38 states that the prostitutes washed themselves in the blood that came from King Ahab when he died in his chariot returning home from his failed attempt to reclaim Ramoth Gilead.
-   More positively, Christianity often uses the idea of being washed clean by Jesus's blood as a metaphor for redemption through his sacrifice. As one classic hymn puts it: "There is a fountain filled with blood / drawn from Immanuel's veins / And sinners plunged beneath that flood / lose all their guilty stains."

    Poetry 

-   A poem penned in the 4th Century by the Christian apologist and staunch anti-pagan Prudentius accuses the priests of the Magna Mater of bathing in bulls' blood in the rite of taurobolium.

    Roleplay

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Godforsaken_: Legends speak of a magical pool of ancient blood in one of the Rotting Castles of Korak-Mar. Anyone who can find this pool and bathe in it is granted great unholy power.
-   _GURPS Fantasy_: Vampires can only heal their injuries by bathing in blood.
-   _Pathfinder_ has the Everdawn Pool, a powerful magical artifact created by the Runelord Sorshen. The pool has many powers, but chief among them is the ability to transform the body of one who bathes in it after filling the pool with the blood of several thousand sacrificed sentient beings. The Big Bad of _Curse of the Crimson Throne_, Queen Ileosa, intends to become an immortal being this way, slaughtering much of the population of Korvosa, including her own followers, in the process.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   The Hag Queens of the Dark Elves practice this, bathing in a magical cauldron filled with blood to maintain their youth. As with so much in Warhammer, the evil blood magic of the cauldrons has been weaponised, and they are wheeled into battle atop grandiose carriages where they act as a focus for the bloodthirsty rites of the Death Hags in praise of the god Khaine - Lord of Murder. The magic of the cauldrons slowly becomes less effective over the centuries, such that the oldest and most powerful Hag Queen - Crone Hellebron - has to endure most of the year as a withered ancient for the few days of youth and vigour it now grants her.
    -   A shout-out to this trope occurs in a vampire context, thanks to the magical Blood Chalice of Bathori carried by the vampiress Isabella von Carstein.
-   _The World of Darkness_:
    -   _New World of Darkness_: The supplement _Immortals_ has The Blood Bathers, who gain a sort of immortality by bathing in blood. Their blood bathing ritual is guaranteed to place any characters who partake in it at the very low end of the Karma Dial.
    -   _Vampire: The Masquerade_: The Blood Bath is one of the sacred rites of the Sabbat. It isn't about youth, but more a ritual of baptism and consecration interpreted through the Sabbat's "Crusades-era Catholicism on PCP" lens.
    -   _Vampire: The Requiem_ has a bloodline of vampires called the Galloi who bathe in blood to make themselves more beautiful. They're not related to Bathory, though; they take their unique Discipline from the worship of Cybele, which often involved initiates being bathed in the blood of a bull to symbolize cleansing (and...other things). Additionally, both Macellarius and Noctoku tend to feast on blood in this manner; the Noctoku can absorb blood through their skin.

    Toys 

-   McFarlane Toys included an Elizabeth Bathory figure bathing in a tub of blood in their 6 Faces of Madness line.
-   Zigzagged with the _Monster High_ toys. As they are fashion dolls, one can buy accessory play sets related to beautification that are owned by specific characters. The vampire character gets a high backed, clawfooted tub; however, she is a literal Vegetarian Vampire and, therefore, bathes in protein and vitamin supplements, rather than blood.

    Video Games 

-   An old magazine ad for _Blood (1997)_ featured some dude, presumably Caleb, in a bathtub full of blood with the tagline "Blood? You're soaking in it."
-   The final boss chamber in _BloodRayne 2_ has a bath full of blood that can regenerate the main character's health and blood meters. Standing in the pool using Rayne's time stopping ability makes this the easiest fight in the game.
-   The Sumerian demon Inanna in _Clive Barker's Jericho_ is encountered while taking a blood shower. As a skilled sanguimancer, she can use the blood to summon the Sumerian Puppet God. Some of the pools in the Roman baths are also filled with blood. (In case you were wondering, the other pools are filled with vomit and excrement.)
-   An early boss who is the subject of an Act I quest in _Diablo II_, dubbed "The Countess", is described as having "bathed in the rejuvenating blood of a hundred virgins" in the tome that initiates her quest.
    -   She can refer to this trope when you meet her, too. "Here for a Blood Bath?"
-   In _Kingdom of Loathing_, this trope is mentioned in one of the potential descriptions for the stench vampires in Dreadsylvania... and mocked by the narrator pointing out that a bath-tub full of blood would quickly coagulate and rot. In this case, it explains the foul odor of the stench-aligned vampire.
-   In _Lobotomy Corporation_, the Abnormality Bloodbath takes the form of a bathtub with blood inside of it and human skin covering it.
-   Variation in the _Mortal Kombat_ remake: the stage at the Bottom of the Pit has blood _showers_. And yes, standing under them gets your character completely drenched in crimson.
    -   DLC character Skarlet is a Humanoid Abomination who gains strength from the blood of fallen warriors (which she consists of). Her fatalities, therefore, involve her enemy's blood spraying/showering over her. Furthermore, her fatality tutorial informs us that Elizabeth Bathory is her favorite historical figure.
-   Vampire Sion does this in her _Melty Blood_ Actress Again ending.
-   The female villain in _Ninja Gaiden II (2008)_ is seen bathing in a pool of blood at one point and is even named "Elizabet" as a Shout-Out.
-   _Ōkamiden_ sees the player travel through time to prevent Akuro from becoming perfect through bathing the vessel he wishes to possess in Orochi's blood.
-   A whole row of them can be found in _Outlast_. A corpse is found in one, with another inmate 'washing' it with its own blood. It's not pretty.
-   One possible haunting in _Paranormal_ has Mattel get locked in the bathroom while blood pours out of the plumbing, filling the tub and sink as the toilet overflows with red.
-   A bathtub specifically made for this is available in _The Sims 2_, specifically in the "Makin' Magic" expansion pack.
-   The _Warcraft_ user map _Defense of the Ancients_ has the Demon/Orc hybrid Strygwyr the Bloodseeker, who bathes in the blood of his slain victims to heal his wounds—including those that can otherwise prove fatal.

-   In _Be Calm_, Ardois wakes up in one after hurling a piece of metal through Richard.
-   In _Blood Stain_, Elliot thinks of one in an Imagine Spot about the doctor's appearance.
-   The human royal couple from _Drowtales_ hunted Elves for this purpose in order to gain immortality. Whether it actually worked is not stated, but given how different fae and human biology are it most likely didn't. Their castle, Chactice, is even named after the modern name for the castle where Elizabeth Bathory lived, Cachtice Castle.
-   In _Elf Blood_, one of TKO's more complex spells involved killing a goat and bathing in its blood.
-   _Karate Bears_ like taking baths in the blood of the innocent.

    **Stewie:** How positively delightful! It's as if someone stabbed Mr. Bubble!
    
-   _Hellboy Animated: Blood and Iron_ features a vampire named Erzsebet Ondrushko, clearly based on Elizabeth Bathory, who bathes in blood to preserve her youth. She gets killed when Professor Bruttenholm sneaks some holy water into her blood bath.
-   The _Moral Orel_ episode "Innocence" follows Orel as he tries to obtain blood to profess his innocence to God and stay young forever (after separate conversations with the Christeins and Coach Stopframe "teach" Orel about the powers of blood). This leads to his father, Clay, discovering Orel in a bathtub surrounded by Doughy, Billy, Tommy, and Maryenetta, with their wrists cut open and bleeding into the tub in the episode "Grounded". The show itself, however, presents all this in Anachronic Order with the conclusion to these events in "Grounded" being aired first and the set-up in "Innocence" being shown later.
