_"HERMIT, n. A person whose vices and follies are not sociable."_

Hermits are folks who don't live around other folks — and they like it that way. They never say I Just Want to Have Friends and they aren't afraid of Dying Alone. Hermits aren't banished or cut off from society as punishment — they willingly chose to leave it, for whatever reason.

Despite their reclusive lifestyle, fictional hermits may be either friendly or hostile. If a hermit is friendly, their reason for living alone will be that they simply enjoy the solitude. If the hermit is hostile, it's because they're misanthropic. On occasion, the hero will encounter a religious hermit.

Nice or not, almost all hermits are quirky. That's because Loners Are Freaks; they don't conform to society's rules about cleanliness, politeness, or footwear. Heck, they don't conform to society's standards at all. Hermits generally have a high tolerance to Going Mad from the Isolation, but they're not completely immune. See "quirkiness" above.

Most classic hermits tend to live in swamps, jungles, deserts, or caves; and are often shown to be Older Than Dirt. Modern hermits are more likely to live in cities or towns, but be highly, highly withdrawn, to the point of never interacting with the outside world. Hikikomori, Basement-Dweller, and the Reclusive Artist are some examples.

If a hero seeks out this person for guidance or training, chances are you're dealing with a Hermit Guru. Other times when a hero meets up with them on a journey, they may become a kind of one-person Wacky Wayside Tribe.

Self-Imposed Exile is another common reason for becoming The Hermit. Unlike other examples of The Exile, where exile is punishment, this hermit is choosing exile for themselves because they feel they must. Sometimes their continued freedom or survival depends on it. It may be a form of living Off the Grid.

Use caution when adding examples from Eastern media — "hermit" is a popular translation for the Chinese _xian_ and Japanese _sennin,_ but not all xian/sennin embody this trope.

Compare The Aloner, for whom social isolation is a terrible punishment, and those Sent Into Hiding. Contrast Hates Being Alone, for when a character really doesn't want to be isolated from others. See I Work Alone for when they don't rely on others. If they're also a magic user, you have a Solitary Sorceress.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _K_: Adolf K. Weismann took off in a blimp after his experiment ended up accidentally making him immortal. He lives up in the sky alone for decades until... plot comes along. He's not ill-adjusted to being around others, though — he is actually incredibly charming, though a lot of that may be due to the fake memories.
-   _Kotoura-san_: Deconstructed. It's a part of Haruka's facade and deliberately having nobody else in her life is taking its toll against her. She does live alone in the Present Day, but the difference between solitude and loneliness is made quite clear as the show goes on.
-   _My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, as I Expected_: Because of his terrible social experiences before high school, Hachiman Hikigaya became the embodiment of this trope in the series, a loner who doesn't want nor care interact with other people, or at least at the beginning of the story.
-   _Soul Eater_: Eibon the wizard lived alone for centuries (at least, in the manga) on Lost Island.
-   _The Voynich Hotel_: Zepis, the legendary second-rate Boiler Engineer, lives in an abandoned mine on the island where the titular hotel stands.

    Card Games 

-   There's the Tarot Card named "The Hermit", which represents contemplative solitude.

    Comic Books 

-   _Archie Comics_: There have been a few stories about hermits — one was about a hermit teen who ran away from foster care and lived in a cave. He chased away any intruders, until Betty got in trouble — then he swooped in, rescued her, and decided he liked people and wanted to live among them again.
-   _Astro City_: Mister Manta becomes this in "The Deep Blue Sea". After decades marooned on a deserted island, he finds his way back to civilization, only to become rattled because he's so accustomed to being alone. He gets marooned again, and happily goes back to "planning" his triumphant return.
-   _Copperhead_: Ishmael lives alone outside town. He claims the choice is due to prejudice and lack of employment opportunities. It's unclear how often he interacts with the community before Clara's arrival; everyone knows who he is but only by reputation.
-   _The Scorpion_: Gottfried dwells in the middle of the desert, protecting the Cross of Peter.
-   _Silverblade_: After making his last film in 1967, Jonathan Lord withdrew to his palatial estate Shangri-la and made no public appearances for the next 20 years: preferring to remain in his mansion watching his old movies.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In Andrew Lang's "The Story Of Prince Ahmed And The Fairy Paribanou" (link), Prince Houssain, having lost out in the competition for Princess Nouronnihar, became a hermit. At the end of the tale, he remains one because he found himself happy in it.

    Fan Works 

-   _Cheating Death: Those That Lived_: Skinner lives alone on the outskirts of District Ten and prefers hunting Mutts to socializing with humans.

-   _Don't Keep Your Distance_: Morris the Iguana left the big city he was from on his motorcycle out of grief when a friend died and drove mindlessly into the forest, eventually happening upon the village Sunny Clearing and deciding to start a new life there when the locals took him in. Quickly, however, he realized he didn't much get along with them owing to their closed-minded mentality, but he does participate in communal activities anyway, it being only fair. One of these activities, a search for food in the woods, was when he found the protagonist, Paint, as a helpless infant.
-   _Egypt on Anur Khufos_: Elias Amsude. Working as a journalist in Giza for nearly 15 years, he's grown bored with modern Egyptian life and wishes more for what the country was like thousands of years ago, and as such he lives under one of the smaller pyramids in a makeshift underground apartment. He's actually a Thep Khufan scribe named Elastamun, who was stationed on Earth to research humans while disguised as one. By the time the story starts, he's called back to his homeworld Anur Khufos by his master, because since he was away, their species had started dying from a mysterious plague while under the rule of a ruthless pharaoh.
-   _Greenfire_: Greenfire, by choice, avoids pony society. Rarity's attempt to invite him to the Summer Sun Celebration doesn't go to well, because he doesn't think that anypony—aside from Rarity—will accept him, plus he feels like Rarity is "bossing him around". He hasn't even had contact with any other dragons, either.
-   In _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_, the four are sent by the Circle to speak to a hermit in a cold piney woods about the whereabouts of a piece of the Nine-part Key.

What they're _not_ warned about is that there is no hermit, just an empty cave and an ambush by the Circle.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: Haara lives alone in the wilderness whenever she's not Walking the Earth on a quest.

    Jokes 

-   Farmer William's son was helping his father unload wares at the market when he let out a fart so huge everyone stared at him. He immediately ran off into the forest, only stopping when he dropped from sheer exhaustion. He lived there for years, fleeing at the slightest approach of a fellow human. One day he saw his reflection in a pond and realized his hair had grown white, and resolved to find out what had become of his village now that he had been long forgotten. He returned to the village and saw a magnificent church had been built near the market. He approached a small child and asked what the building was, and the child replied "That's the Church of Our Lady Mary. They started building it five years, six months and three days; and finished building it twenty-six years, four months and nine days after the day Farmer William's son farted".

When they meet him, though, he is a blonde, blue-eyed -filthy- man who suffers from unrequited love and is seventeen at most.

    Live-Action TV

In this fantasy, Eric becomes a hermit living alone purifying and re-drinking his own urine, having changed his name to Plays-With-Squirrels. He wrote an immense manifesto (claiming that every hermit has one), which includes a thousand blank pages and only one with writing on it- "Lose one friend, lose all friends, lose yourself."
-   _Doctor Who_: In "The Time Monster", the Doctor refers to visiting a hermit who lived on a mountain behind his house on Gallifrey. (Fanon has it that this was K'anpo Rinpoche, the Buddhist Time Lord from "Planet of the Spiders".)
-   In _Merlin (2008)_, the titular character's father Balinor lived as a hermit.

-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ The elderly Bajoran farmer Mullibok along with his friends Baltrim and Keena become hermits on the Bajoran moon Jerrado, but are forced to leave in 2369 when an energy transfer project made the moon uninhabitable.

-   _The Walking Dead (2010)_: It's no big surprise that he would enjoy being alone, but the circumstances at hand make it tragic. Daryl Dixon becomes a hermit in Season 9 Episode 5. After Rick Grimes blows up the bridge the communities were building to destroy a massive walker herd and seemingly sacrificed himself, Daryl cried over the loss of his "brother". He then silently realizes that his and Maggie's actions trying to kill Negan ended up getting Rick "killed" instead. As a result, Daryl walks off alone and lived in the woods for six long years. In the six years he spent in the woods, Daryl desperately tried to find Rick's body or evidence of survival for closure. At some point he did find a dog he simply called "Dog" who he trained and kept around for company. However, it can be presumed that Daryl spent a vast majority of the six years living in the woods completely by himself. Downplayed because he encountered Michonne looking for Rick's body on the riverbank about eight months after Rick blew up the bridge. Later on the next day, he helps her find Judith and the other missing children who were kidnapped by Michonne's old friend Jocelyn and her group. It is also subverted partially because Daryl told Carol where to find him if she wanted to see him. However, dialogue between Henry and Daryl suggest that Carol hasn't seen much of Daryl after the bridge explosion. As such, Daryl spent many years completely cut off from his allies who cared about him.
-   _Uchu Sentai Kyuranger_: Stinger/Sasori Orange prefers solitude as he doesn't want to associate with anyone. Dark and Troubled Past is major cause for this. He can be roughly kind under the right circumstances.

    -   _The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon_: While exploring Avalar, Spyro and Cynder encounter an old cheetah hermit who lives alone in the wilderness rather than among the other cheetahs in the village.

However, she is also tasked with aiding people with her wisdom, so she's not a complete recluse. Though called an Evil Hermit, Seiga Kaku is not much for isolation (what with masterminding religious takeovers and living with a zombie).

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_: In the Remnant fairytale, the Story of the Seasons, The Old Wizard lived in an isolated cabin in the middle of a forest. He received no visitors and hadn't even left the house to step outside in centuries when the four heroic sisters encountered him. Through their compassion and persistence, they encouraged him to accept their presence, their help and to even step into the sunlight, transforming his life for the better. In return, he rewarded them with his magical powers so they could use them to help humanity. Volume 5 confirms he is a previous incarnation of Professor Ozpin, and Volume 6 heavily implies the Old Wizard was reeling from a terrible tragedy; Ozpin demonstrates that he still retains that trauma response when the heroes' discovery of the secret he's been keeping about Salem causes him to emotionally collapse and isolate himself in the back of Oscar's mind; he doesn't recover enough to return until the very end of Volume 7.
