When beds get destroyed.

_"Sex is always better when you're breaking something."_

Sometimes, a couple has supernatural strength, or are just really rough (or, for that matter, really large and heavy). But they still need to fulfill their sexual desires. This is the result of them being stronger than their surroundings.

The location they've chosen for their night of passion breaks up around them as they display their sex drive. By the time they finish their act, they're surrounded by broken timbers, falling plaster, rattling floors, and shattered furniture.

There's usually no actual anger or rage involved. That's Slap-Slap-Kiss or Interplay of Sex and Violence. This is also commonly used to insinuate one character's sexual prowess. Contrast Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex where sex between a supernatural and a mortal is impossible because of the power difference. See also Did the Earth Move for You, Too? for when this happens _during_ a disastrous event, Out with a Bang for when the someone _dies_ as a direct result of having sex and Post-Coital Collapse for when sex is implied by showing the couple collapsing after finishing.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Any sexual encounter with extraspecies in _Monster Musume_ due to their strength. Kimihito admits that he must train his body like crazy to have a chance of surviving the wedding night with whoever he marries.
-   _Hybrid × Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia_: During the LN's 10th volume, Kizuna had to perform Climax Hybrid with his big sister, Reiri, to install her 'Ros-core. The problem being, they had to cum at the same time for the installation to stick. By the time they finally got it "right"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the energy released from their mutual orgasm was so intense that it _obliterated_ the Love Room.
-   In _Vassalord_, Charley seems to think attacking Rayflo with assorted heavy weaponry counts as foreplay. Rayflo seems to agree. Fortunately, they're both vampires, so no harm done.

    Comic Books 

-   _Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Presents)_: The Topographical Man is a cosmic predator in humanoid form, a sinister figure so large that his hands grasp stars light years apart. Whole civilisations live upon his body. Or, at least, they do until the Guardians' Vance Astro temporarily possesses him and participates in an "act of love" with the equally huge disembodied spirit of fellow Guardian Nikki, which tears his body apart and destroys the nearby stars, ending in a _huge_ explosion. It's not directly shown to be sex, but it's very heavily implied, not least by Nikki and Vance's interactions afterwards.
-   Heavily implied in _Harley Quinn_ Volume 4 after Harley, Poison Ivy and Catwoman spend a night together at a hotel. Not only is their bed completely trashed, there are claw marks on the wall above it.
-   Explicit in the background of a pair of minor characters in the _Powers_ comic: a married superhero/ex-supervillain pair got together through these kinds of moments. Of course, readers only learn of this because _Powers_ tends to bring its background characters to the fore to mix A Day in the Limelight with Monster of the Week, meaning that having their backstory filled in involved the ex-supervillain husband (among others) being brutally murdered by the demon that gave the superhero wife her powers, and then her own suicide to keep the demon inside her from using her to kill further.
-   In the short-lived _Penthouse ComiX_ line, every encounter between Captain Adventure and Hericane caused varying levels of property damage (up to and including a Caieratornado-like trail of destruction if Hericane is worked up enough).
-   In the CrossGen comic _Negation_, Evinlea of the First switches sides from the protagonist's True Companions and seduces Emperor Charon of the Negation Empire. As they're both cosmic-powered immortals and Charon's been without sex so long that he's literally forgotten what it was like (and is thus a tad over-enthusiastic when Evinlea finally... reminds him), their moment of... mutual fulfillment... involves a destructive energy release that literally _vaporizes half the planet they're having sex on_. Pity that it was an _inhabited_ planet, but they _were_ the villains.
-   The captioned pic above features She-Hulk and X-Men villain-turned-member-turned-villain-again-but-was-faking-it-the-whole-time, Cain Marko, The Juggernaut (bitch). She-Hulk, herself, vehemently denied doing the deed with Juggernaut. Turns out it was a (very pleased-with-herself) double from an alternate Earth that nailed him.
-   The Hoffmanites of _Buck Godot: Zap Gun for Hire_ have _all_ their relationships like this. Courtship begins with high explosives and presumably progresses from there.
    -   Buck's "Snerta" brand mattress is labeled "(Tough enough for a Hoffman)...but no funny stuff or forget it"
-   In an issue of _Daredevil_ set during the _Inferno_ storyline, Kingpin gets into a fight with Typhoid Mary—whom he hired to kill Daredevil—that ends in sex. After the deed is done, the office is half-pulverized, half burned-down (from Mary's mutant powers), and they both have this smug look while getting dressed, thinking the other is completely wrapped around their finger.
    -   Also an example in Frank Miller's "The Man Without Fear" miniseries. Foggy arrives at the dorm room he shares with Matt and yells that the chain is on. A shirtless Matt cracks the door open and says to give him a minute. Quite a while later, a smiling Elektra comes out of the room. Foggy enters and finds the room utterly destroyed and Matt wearing only his underwear and a smile. "She really is a nice girl, Foggy..."
-   In _The Dark Knight Strikes Again_, Superman and Wonder Woman have sex, resulting in earthquakes, tidal waves, and more forms of destruction on a massive scale.
    -   Parodied by comic artist Stjepan Šejić who created an image that had Superman suggest to Wonder Woman that they should leave the area when news crews show up wondering why _Mount Everest_ had been reduced to rubble.
-   6 Insane Disney Comics You Won't Believe Are Real points out _The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck_ story "The Prisoner of White Agony Creek," which implies Scrooge and Goldie's Slap-Slap-Kiss relationship culminates in this.
    
    **Roy Bean:** Based on careful deliberation (and many years of experience with life), it is the verdict of this court that what's going on in that cabin is _not_ a hangin' offense in Langtry, Texas — or anywhere else, thank gosh!
    
    -   Don Rosa himself said that he didn't show the scene because Disney wouldn't have allowed what he intended them to do.
-   The angel and devil that sired Genesis in _Preacher_:
    
    **Angel:** It was a tornado. A hurricane. A tsunami crashing down upon a tower of rock. Our juices fell like rain on the inferno.  
    **Jesse:** Hey!  
    **Angel:** We were not meant to even meet, let alone achieve such union. We were not created —  
    **Jesse:** Hey! How much more of this horseshit have I gotta listen to?
    
-   Scandal Savage and Knockout of the _Secret Six_ both genuinely love each other, but due to one being a Dark Action Girl and the other being a former Female Fury they managed to trash several successive hotel rooms when they went out together, as seen here.<small>◊</small>
-   Although what exactly happened between X-23 and teen Warren after their date in _All-New X-Men_ has thus far been left as Did They or Didn't They?, one of the arguments for "did" is Laura waking up at one of the Worthington family retreats to find the bedroom utterly trashed, with upended (and apparently _clawed_) furniture, scattered books, other pieces of decor and clothes strewn all over the place. Whatever _actually_ happened, it clearly got rather wild.
-   In the New 52 _Catwoman_, one of Catwoman's flings with Batman is rough and wild, to where Selina compares it to a bar fight.
-   Late '80s erotic comic _Beauty and the Beast_ involves a stoic, beautiful woman falling in passionate love with a giant, super-strong beast of a man. Their lovemaking is so intense it sunk the ship they chartered to a home in Ireland and they regularly demolish their cottage.

    Fan Works 

-   In _The Accidental Bond_, Gabrielle goes into a sexual frenzy during Veela puberty and she and Harry wake up to find a half-destroyed bedroom.
-   Xander and Cordelia manage to (very loudly) completely destroy their hotel room. The entire hotel lobby gives them a standing ovation when they check out and the Bellhop tips Xander. In _And Another Thing I Hate About You._
-   "Apprehension": Downplayed version when Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue break a banister in the middle of lovemaking. Justified in that they're in a really shoddy rented home.
-   Shows up in a lot of post-series fic featuring any of the three Official Couples of _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, usually alongside Power Perversion Potential for the youngest couple or Brains and Bondage for the two older couples.
-   In the rather bizarre _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fan fic _Beyond the Goddess Within_, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle fight over Spike, and halfway through, begin to have sex. Then they fuse together.
-   _A Burning Flame in My Soul_: Spike recalls how his and Ember's relationship first became sexual after one heat cycle proved too much for either of them, and they ended up in bed together. He remarks how that night was "awesome" even though they had to replace their bed afterwards.
-   Harry and Raven apparently didn't have particularly wild sex in _The Complications of a Vegas Wedding_ so much as their powers both react to intense emotions. The walls, floors, and ceilings of their suite were left ridiculous combinations of colors, the walls all had scorch marks, most of the furniture had been thrown across the room, the windows were blown out, and the headboard of the bed had grown into a tree.
-   _A Crown of Stars_: In Chapter 50, Asuka and Shinji have a talk that devolves into an argument and a martial arts fight. Milder than other examples, they do not damage too much the furniture and the fight finishes quickly when Asuka throws Shinji onto the bed before landing onto him and kissing him. Passionate lovemaking ensued.
-   _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_:
    -   In one of the character fan arts, Tapper and Duncan McSmurf are shown next to each other, using their appearances as visual metaphors of their first time with their wives, with Tapper having angel wings and a halo and Duncan looking like he had been in a fight.
    -   In the full story "Wedding Bells for Bigmouth", Bigmouth and Bignose's (implied) sex causes the ground near their house to shake so hard that Greedy's wedding cake ends up flattening itself.
-   _Equestria Girls: Friendship Souls_: It's all but stated that Sweet Cider and Hard Nail engaged in this while alive during a brief moment of peace when Lament jokes about how his fight with Sweet Cider reminded him of that time when Granny Smith wasn't around and Cider quickly shushes him with a blush since Applejack is nearby. What's remarkable about it, it's that they were both human at that point. With them being now powerful Soul Reaper and Arrancar, respectively one can only imagine what they can do now...
-   Subverted in _Naruto_ fanfic _The Four Horsemen._ If Naruto—Chaos—and Sasuke—Death—were not in the Temple of Death when they first got it on, they would have _destroyed the whole world around them_.
    
    _"It's the walls," Naruto explained. "When I first came, the last of the monks that had followed the teachings of Padmasambhava were still tending the place. They would sit in the temple, chanting the words that were etched in the surrounding stone. I don't know if it's the effects of centuries of chanting, or the engraving on the walls themselves, but this temple helped contain my powers. I could unleash them and they didn't escape the walls."_
    
-   In _Harry Potter and the Four Heirs_, Hermione's parents have sex for the first time after becoming a witch and wizard and a surge of accidental magic ruins their bedroom.
    
    **Emma:** When you make the earth move for me, Daniel, you don't muck about.
    
-   _Hellsister Trilogy_: Kara and Dev are a Kryptonian couple. Breaking beds is _routine_ to them.
    
    **Dev-Em:** We didn't break the bed this time, did we? I mean, we really didn't, did we? I don't want to cost you any more money.
    
-   In _The Hidden Dragon_ Harry is a Morphixen and when he and Charlie have sex for the first time, they end up trashing his house.
-   In the last part of the _How I Met Your Mother_ fan fic _Instant Pleasure_, Marshall, Lily, Ted, Robin, and Barney's extremely vigorous _five-way_ causes the bed to collapse under them.
-   Josh and Donna break a couple of coffee tables (and Josh's leg) in part of _The Joshua Monologues_ series.
-   In the _Good Omens_ fic _Lie Back and Think of Dinner_, Aziraphale's divine powers get out of control whenever he tries to get intimate with Crowley, causing unfortunate things like earthquakes, golden syrup rain, and Crowley's hair catching fire.
-   _Luminosity_ features a relatively mild example, with the damage being limited to a hotel bed. This ends up being plot-relevant: One of the hotel staff connects Edward to some local vampire myths, and in the course of being reassured that Bella is uninjured tips them off about a possible means by which the two of them can have children together.
-   _Supergirl (2015)_ fanfic _my youth is yours_: The good news is that Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex isn't an issue, because Kara has too much self-control to hurt Lena. The bad news is that this normally comes at the cost of everything else in reach. Lena mentions that in college she and Kara were called into the dean's office multiple times over the large amount of broken furniture until Lena stopped reporting the damages and just had everything fixed herself.
-   Because Raven's powers go out of control when she becomes emotional, several fics involving her lovemaking will result in a lot of furniture psychically exploding. Averted in _New Tamaran_, where her loss of virginity to Beast Boy tears open space-time, forms a new dimension and creates the Green Martians across the multiverse. It Makes Sense in Context. Played straight at the beginning of the story, where Robin's deflowering of Starfire ends with the top floor of Titans Tower reduced to rubble. Later, Supergirl admits her and Robin's first time resulted in similar destruction to Wayne Manor.
-   In one _Percy Jackson_ fanfic, which involved Nico/Percy slash, it is revealed that children of the Big Three can never engage in coitus — their powers mix and go out of control. In their case, Percy manipulates copious amounts of water without thinking, and Nico makes the earth shift. There's a high-risk level with this, and Nico sums it up quite nicely: "We're a mudslide waiting to happen."
-   In _Potter's Bones_ the backlash of a soul bond forming between Harry, Hermione, and Susan during three-way sex trashes their room at Hogwarts.
-   The "Seras Has to Have It!" _Hellsing_ porn comic by Fred Perry features Alucard and Seras having sex so harshly that they break through the floor or their room, straight into Integra's boudoir. Not that it make them stop any; they break Integra's bed shortly afterward. Integra isn't happy about all of this.
-   Happens between Francis and Sheva in _Shadowchasers: Conspiracy_. It's not clear how the brutal, bloody fistfight turned into sex, as it happened "offscreen", but it did, and uprooted _whole trees_ as a result. Unlike most examples of this trope, the aftermath wasn't very pleasant. Sheva still intended to kill him, but stopped because another villain was watching, and Francis was disgusted at what happened when he woke up.
-   We can only speculate what happens in Chapter 32 of _Shinji And Warhammer 40 K_ when several female cast members decide the best way to deal with Shinji's sync-ratio problems is to resolve some pent-up teenage stress with the help of the local (tantric) priests and drag Asuka along for the ride. All we know for sure is that several buildings collapsed, portents of doom are sensed throughout Tokyo-3, Terminators have to be deployed, and Shinji and Asuka absolutely refuse to discuss it.
-   Happens a number of times in the _Sith Academy_ stories, most notably in "The Night of No Sleep" when Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi end up banging their heads so hard against the wall adjacent to Darth Maul's apartment that their heads go _through_ the wall. Maul makes a point of getting revenge on Qui-Gon the same way the next time he gets in the sack with Obi-Wan.
-   Downplayed in _Son of the Sannin_. While Fu states in chapter 76 that she and Shino haven't had sex yet, she later admits to being rather... aggressive when they make out. Much later in Chapter 121, when Fu stops Hashirama's strongest jutsu with her pure strength, Naruto remarks that, if Shino survives his honeymoon with her, he'll be his hero.
-   In _The Thunder of Dragons_, Hermione's first heat after coming into her Dracken inheritance results in her and Charlie trashing the bed, destroying an end table, punching a hole in the wall, and leaving feathers everywhere.
-   _The Wedding Crashers_ ends with this: Leah and Cas have sex in a motel room, causing several lightbulbs in the area to start exploding thanks to the latter's powers.
-   In _What Happens Next_, Bucky ends up breaking down the door to Darcy's apartment while they're having sex. Their reaction is to casually move into Bucky's room to keep going at it.
-   In _Naruto_ fanfic _When Love Fades,_ one time, Naruto's and Sasuke's romping got so intense that they destroyed a bed. And they're just _regular humans_ in this story.
    
    The bed springs hadn't been able to stand up to their efforts, and the thin mattress was sagging down nearly to the floor.
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   There is a prominent one in _300: Rise of an Empire_ between the hero and the main villain nonetheless. The fact is that Artemisia is looking for a man to be at her side, and as her Generals prove to be totally incompetent, she summons Themistokles to her ship for a parlay, gives him a We Can Rule Together speech, and tries to kiss him. He falls for the temptation and they proceed to have sex so violent that it's more like a "Who's raping who" contest. After she shows her satisfaction for finally finding a real man up to her status, he simply replies "No."
-   After the Sexy Discretion Shot of Bruce Almighty's "heavenly" sex with Grace, we cut to him lying in bed in the morning, with mattress cover on the floor, the mattress itself dislodged, the pillows stuffed down the back, and the duvet sloppily placed to cover Bruce's groin.
-   Barnabas and Angelique trash her whole office by making love everywhere (including the walls and ceiling) in _Dark Shadows_.
-   Miss Strudwick from _Doctor in Love_ once knew a man who, after reading a sex-help book with his wife, turned up to work with a fractured ankle.
-   The act performed by the possessed Dana Barrett and Louis Tully in _Ghostbusters (1984)_ could be considered an extreme example of this trope, as it was supposed to bring about the END OF THE WORLD. Sex doesn't get much more destructive than that.
-   A deleted scene from _Hancock_ has the titular character warn a girl he takes back to his home that she needs to get off when he climaxes. The film then cuts to his trailer shaking like crazy. As he reaches the moment, he tosses the woman off and blasts three holes on his roof with his ejaculation.
-   _The Hour of the Pig_: A downplayed example, but Maria while having sex with Courtois puts her foot through a nearby (presumably thin) wall.
-   A subversion of this happens early on in _The Losers_, where Clay and Aiesha retire to Clay's room under the pretext of a traditional bar hook-up. Upon being called out on her hidden motive, a fight ensues that juggles foreplay and firestarting.
-   _Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)_: John and Jane Smith are trying to kill each other for plot-related reasons. But despite the fact that they're trying to kill each other and hate each other for the mutual betrayal, they still love each other. They're using guns, and when the bullets run out, they go hand-to-hand. They throw each other bodily all over their marital home, floor to ceiling, room to room (not necessarily using doors for it), and finally give in to their desires. They make love on the single clean spot left on the floor, unconcerned that the house is completely destroyed, and that they have other problems. Which makes for quite the awkward moment when their neighbors, accompanied by police officers, pay a call about the ruckus...
-   The sex scenes in _My Super Ex-Girlfriend_: one of them just breaks the legs of the bed. One sends it through the wall into the next-door apartment. One ends up with a large shark thrown at it, but that's something of another story...
-   _Norbit_: The protagonist is forced to marry Rasputia, a morbidly obese woman who loves to make sexual fantasies with him every night. Unfortunately for Norbit, these fantasies always start with Rasputia jumping on Norbit, with her enormous weight causing the bed to break to the floor with a huge crash, smashing Norbit in the process. Rasputia takes pleasure in this, but not Norbit, judging by his expressions and screams of pain. Finally, after a while, the bed no longer breaks... because the couple places a huge concrete block underneath.
-   In an interesting twist of this trope, in the John Wayne romantic film _The Quiet Man_, he and his new bride argue so vigorously that they break the bed (It Makes Sense in Context) but end up **not** consummating the marriage on the wedding night. This trope is subtly invoked, though (this was the era of The Hays Code, after all). When the matchmaker O'Flynn visits the next morning, he finds the ruined bed: "Impetuous! Homeric!" he declares with shock.
-   In _Raise Your Voice_, the Goth Pianist storms into Kiwi's room to scream at him that he's the loudest fucker in the whole damn school, to which Kiwi responds by pushing her into the wall and kissing her. Then she pushes him back, kissing him as they knock over lamps, send all the drum sets flying, and otherwise cause a huge mess and quite a bit of noise.
-   Parodied in _Shoot 'Em Up_, in which Clive Owen and Monica Bellucci have sex during a gunfight. Thugs break in while they're having sex, and Owen starts shooting back at them without bothering to disengage.
-   _Simon Sez_
-   _Scaramouche_: It starts as Slap-Slap-Kiss with frying pans. It ends with a make-up nookie that tears apart Lenore's carriage from the inside out (with frying pans still in hand).
-   _The Suicide Squad_. After President Luna suggests to Harley Quinn that We Can Rule Together, they proceed to have Wall Bang Her sex which destroys a good part of the priceless artifacts in the room. They also set the floor on fire thanks to a carelessly knocked over candelabra. And smash a display cabinet of firearms including the gun that Harley uses to shoot Luna afterwards, having become wise to the perils of boyfriends who are even more psychotic than she is.
-   Done for pure slapstick in _The Tall Guy_. Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson demolish a flat the first time they have sex. Not that there's any fight involved, they just lose control a bit.
-   One film adaptation of _The Three Musketeers_ has D'Artagnan screwing Milady's maid on a previously-established-to-be-very-sturdy iron-framed bed. After he leaves, she leans against the bed and it collapses into several pieces.
-   Subverted in _The War of the Roses_. Part of the climactic fight ends up with Kathleen Turner straddling Michael Douglas, begging him to show her his... "little captain". He does, but it doesn't end well for him.
-   Ryan Harrison has sex in _Wrongfully Accused_ that isn't particularly vigorous, but it _does_ cause an airbag to deploy from the headboard.
-   There's a whole genre of porn dedicated to this, called sexfight (sometimes "cockfight" for the male homosexual version). Although obviously they usually destroy very little of the scenery, as they tend to be low on budget.

    Literature 

-   Similar to the above example, Bones in the _Night Huntress_ books is occasionally prone to this. One of his encounters resulted in a shattered lamp, a broken table, a bloodstained carpet, an overturned couch, and various other damaged items, prompting Cat to describe the room as looking like a brawl had taken place there.
-   _The Dresden Files:_
    -   In a twisted inversion, sex takes place to _prevent_ destruction in _Death Masks_.
    -   Bob the Skull cheers Harry on from an unfortunately mistaken notion of Destructo Nookie in "Something Borrowed," the short story written for _My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding_.
    -   The end of _White Night_. Harry uses the energy from the emotions from kissing resident succubus Lara Wraith to strengthen his shield against a massive explosion, and they get shot out of a cave like a cannonball. And continue through most of a wing of her mansion.
-   Subverted in _Catch-22_ with Yossarian and Nately's whore. First, she's trying to kill him, then for a bit, it really looks like it's going to be this trope... aaand then she goes for the knife. Admit it, you were fooled. And so was he!
-   Robert A. Heinlein's _Beyond This Horizon_ contains a bit resembling this trope: the protagonist beats up his love interest; she returns the favor. True Romance.
-   Tanya Huff's _Summon the Keeper_ books involve this. The first time Claire and Dean have sex, they _make an angel_ — and, by extension, a demon.
-   Vampires in _The Twilight Saga_ all have destructo sex; the resident hulk says he and his ice queen wife have broken multiple houses.
    -   Not to mention that when the main couple went out on their honeymoon, they managed to break their vacation bedroom multiple times.
-   In what seems to be a common theme among vampires, those of Brian Lumley's _Necroscope_ series do this as well. Newly-turned Harry Keogh gets it on with vampire Lady Karen, in the course of which they reduce her stone bed to rubble.
-   In Lucy A. Snyder's _Spellbent_, Jessie and Cooper have sex to magically summon a thunderstorm. Later in the series, after she's acquired a magical hellfire arm, they try to make love and almost burn down a house.
-   In _The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms_, Yeine and Nahadoth have one of these. It's stated that Yeine is the first mortal ever to survive the experience.
-   Brought up in _Solo Leveling_: In the middle of the night, President Go Gun-Hee feels the presence of two strong hunters, and catches Sung Jin-Woo and Cha Hae-In sneaking into the Hunter Training Area on the camera feed. He then recalls an exchange he had with Hae-In and realizes how she feels for Jin-Woo, and orders the camera to be cut off. While the _entire building shakes,_ he muses on how "It's good to be young." In truth, Chae-In was beating the crap out of Igrit.
-   Clay and Elena from _Women of the Otherworld_ have a tendency to cause mass damage when they decide to get down. In the aftermath of one moment, they find that not only did they deliberately shred the bedsheets, but they have also somehow knocked down everything hanging from the walls.
-   Averted and lampshaded in _The Fault in Our Stars_ when Hazel and Gus have sex, with Hazel commenting that "no headboards were broken," seemingly as a Take That! to _The Twilight Saga_.
-   In the _Zeroes_ series, occurs when Crash and Mob have sex for the first time. When Crash climaxes, she briefly loses control of her superpower and accidentally destroys a nearby ship.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Boys (2019)_: In "We Gotta Go Now", Stormfront and Homelander destroy an apartment (plus injure themselves) between and during their intimate moments. It's clear that, for both of them, part of the excitement is being with a partner who is mutually nigh-indestructible.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In "Smashed", Buffy and Spike get into a brawl in an abandoned house. At some point in the fight, they go from trading blows to kissing, and they end up having sex up against a wall before the floor gives out beneath them.
        -   And even _**that**_ doesn't stop them — they just keep going and going...
        -   The line about the Destructo-Nookie from the following episode (as the Nookie was part of a Cliffhanger) was named one of the best post-coital lines ever:
            
            **Buffy:** When did the building fall down?
            
    -   Another episode opens with a slow pan across a trashed room, accompanied by the sounds of passion and breaking objects, ending with Spike and Buffy lying post-coitus under the carpet.
        
        **Buffy:** We missed the bed again.  
        **Spike:** Lucky for the bed.
        
    -   A downplayed example also happens between Spike and Buffy in season 10, after getting back together. Upon reaffirming that they both still have feelings, they burst into Spike and Xander's apartment, throwing each other against walls as they aggressively make out and strip. Overhearing the commotion from the next apartment over, Xander complains that whatever they're doing, he knows it's resulting in the destruction of his action figures.
    -   The overtly sexualized scene in "Graduation Day Part 2" when Buffy makes Angel vamp out and drink her blood. While he's lying on top of her, she grabs a metal object for support, and it just crumples. She also kicks a table through a wall. Angel leaves her with the most insane hickey in history through all of Season 4.
    -   A very serious — and dangerous — example of this trope happened between Buffy and Angel in the comic book, during Season Eight, at the urging of the entity that would eventually become Twilight. With Angel under Demonic Possession, he raised an army that all but decimated Buffy's organization. When the two actually confronted each other, they were seemingly drugged, unable to fight, and urged to give in to their passion for each other. What resulted was _airborne_ sex that caused them to smash through mountains, fly into orbit, through time, and through dimensional barriers, all while creating cataclysms on Earth that resulted in Twilight's dimension being created. (Buffy and Angel managed to snap out of it then, but it was only going to get worse...)
    -   The whole incident is elegantly lampshaded by Kennedy later on, when she sets Buffy straight, reminding her how she "literally fucked up everything."
    -   It's a little more indirect, but the loss of Angel's soul in Season 2 also leads directly to the world ending event of Acathla. Buffy and Angel cannot bang without an Apocalypse How. ...or at least a Timey-Wimey Ball in I Will Remember You. They have never successfully banged without cosmic events happening as a direct consequence.
-   _Moonlighting_: Dave and Maddie have a brawl that leads to throwing things and the destruction of Maddie's living room before they end up with an afterglow romantic shot in bed several minutes later.
-   In _Burn Notice_, Fiona challenges Michael to a fight when Michael refuses to talk about their relationship. Halfway through the fight turns into a fight/grope-fest and a few minutes later it just turns into flat-out sex.
    -   In the episode "Company Man," the camera pans across broken furnishings strewn around Michael's apartment while the voiceover describes Michael's current situation as particularly vulnerable to attack, and then the camera pans to Fiona pinning Michael against the wall in order to have rough sex with him.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   This is pretty much a Klingon's idea of a hot date (the violence being less "trigger" and more "foreplay"). A broken collarbone during the wedding night is considered a sign of good luck for the newlyweds. Worf explains:
        
        **Worf:** Men do not roar. Women roar! Then they hurl heavy objects and claw at you.  
        **Wesley:** ...What does the man do?  
        **Worf:** _\[dreamily\]_ He reads love poetry... _\[snaps out of it\]_ He ducks a lot.
        
    -   The _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "Looking For par'Mach In All The Wrong Places" had three characters coming into sickbay for sex-related injuries (Quark didn't inflict sufficient damage upon the Klingon chick for her to need repairs). Worf and Dax literally start out with a bat'leth duel, which is implied to be Klingon tradition.
        
        **Dr. Bashir:** No... No, I don't need that image, either. In fact, I'm gonna stop asking that question altogether. People will come in, I will treat them, and that's all.
        
    -   Curiously, the same appears to be true of Vulcans. You'd think it was a match made in Sto-Vo-Kor, but the pairing's uncommon at best. The trouble is that the Vulcans' violent Pon Farr period only rolls around once every seven years or so. The Klingons would probably find the Vulcans' distant cousins the Romulans more to their liking (as they're _always_ rather passionate and hot-tempered), if not for the two races' historical enmity. Also, the violence of the _pon farr_ involving killing any potential rival; we've seen no evidence the sex itself is violent.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_:
        -   In the episode "Course: Oblivion", when Captain Janeway of the biomimetic _Voyager_ says during the wedding of Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres that B'Elanna requested foregoing of the use of Klingon painsticks in favor of a traditional human wedding, Harry Kim is quick to joke that the couple is saving the painsticks for the honeymoon.
        -   In the episode "Prophecy", Neelix and a female Klingon wreck Tuvok's quarters when they were having sex together.
    -   Hinted at in the _Star Trek: Enterprise_ episode "Babel One" when Captain Archer notices that Commander Shran is having a relationship with his Number Two Talas.
        
        **Shran:** Andorian women are far more aggressive than Earth females. She made... an overture. I had a choice — charge her with assaulting a superior... or mate with her.
        
-   _The Orville_ takes it more seriously than _Star Trek_. Keyali and LaMarr's romantic relationship is ruined by the facts that (a) they can't keep their hands off each other when they get together, and (b) despite their best intentions to be careful it always ends with LaMarr limping to sickbay seriously injured. Both are grief-stricken.
-   _Supernatural_: In "Goodbye Stranger", Meg suggests that if she and Castiel survive, she'll "order pizza" and they can "move some furniture around". Castiel not only gets the innuendo (after some thought), but seems to actually be considering it. A pity that Meg _doesn't_ survive.
-   An early episode of _Roseanne_ has Dan and Roseanne's fight over a tacky souvenir clock degenerate into furniture-throwing. After they heft the couch out onto the front lawn, they lock eyes and go straight for the bedroom. The scene cuts to a steamy afterglow shot.
-   Happened a few times in _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_ and _Xena: Warrior Princess._
-   There was a line in the TV series _Wiseguy_ where the villain played by Tim Curry says to his wife "You call it fighting, I call it foreplay!".
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_: This happens between Colonel Tigh and his wife Ellen in one episode, but it's made perfectly clear their relationship is seriously dysfunctional. The writers specifically included the scene to show there was, in fact, some attraction between the two despite this.
-   Subverted on _Desperate Housewives_. Edie and Carlos have been having trouble with their sex life, and an argument appears to be leading towards this trope. She throws him against the fridge to make out and a pepper grinder falls on his head. He throws her onto the table and it collapses from their combined weight. Cut to them at the doctor's office, getting stitches for their injuries.
-   Weirdly enough, a dance routine on the sixth season of _So You Think You Can Dance_ was intended to portray this. Also, it was freaking amazing.
-   On _One Life to Live_, Max and Blair, in the depths of their mutual gambling addictions, and he wrongly believing that his wife Luna is cheating on him with his best friend (thanks to Blair's lies and scheming), proceed to wreck a hotel room during a sex scene that involved him slamming her against the wall several times, knocking over tables and chairs, and at one point, clearly taking her from behind (a shocking daytime first), before finally falling onto the one table they haven't knocked over.
-   The _Castle_ episode "Always Buy Retail" contains a good example of this trope. Castle and his ex-wife having quite a brawl, with her legs knocking glasses and pictures off the table, them breaking the bed, her ripping off the curtain, and eventually both falling off said bed so hard that pictures fall off the wall and break. And it seems that it was most casual too.
-   In the _Smallville_ episode "Wrath," Lana Lang temporarily gains superpowers identical to Clark's. This means they can finally have sex without him destroying her. Earthquakes ensue. Results in a funny moment as the entire town—including their mutual best friend Chloe—feel the quakes, and Chloe later arrives at the Kent Farm and discovers (to her supreme awkwardness) the source of the quakes.
-   In the final season of _The West Wing_, rumours arise that Democratic candidate Matt Santos and his wife destroyed an antique bed in a hotel room that they were staying in.
    -   ("Hurricane Santos")
        
        **Santos (to reporters):** So, I'm going to address this once, just this once, and that'll be the end of it, okay: No way was that bed steel-reinforced.
        
-   _All My Children_'s adulterous Alec and Arlene destroyed his apartment (which she'd already trashed) having sex on the night he married her DAUGHTER.
-   In _Frasier_ the titular character does it in Bora Bora, alone, on a bed, to feign great sex, with no superpowers.
-   Heavily implied once on _The Big Bang Theory_, back when Leonard and Penny first started dating. Sheldon demanded to know why they were at his and Leonard's apartment when they had agreed that when they wanted to spend the night together, they would do so at Penny's. Leonard looked _very_ smug and replied that they couldn't because her bed broke.
-   On _My Name Is Earl_, Jamal and Hector, the respective leaders of two Prison gangs fall in love after they are placed in solitary together. They each know that their men will not accept their relationship, because it is both interracial and homosexual, and because their gangs are bitter rivals, so they get their gangs to fight while they sneak off. After a Second-Act Breakup, Earl gets Jamal and Hector back together, and the warden allows them to meet in his office once a month to "discuss their gangs' grievances."
    
    **Warden:** That sounds like it's going to be a tough negotiation! I would _not_ want to be in the middle of those two!
    
-   Happens in _Jessica Jones (2015)_ when she and Luke Cage find out they both have Super-Strength (Jessica being stronger but Luke being practically indestructible). They had already been fuckbuddies for a couple of episodes beforehand, but they were being gentle with each other since they didn't know the other had powers. When they learn each other's secret after a nasty Bar Brawl, they get it on in a whole new light that breaks Luke's bed.
-   On _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, Lorelei, the Asgardian Enchantress, comes to Midgard (Earth) looking for followers. Eventually, she hooks up with (or rather, mind-controls and rapes) Agent Grant Ward, who brings her to Las Vegas, where they proceed to destroy the hotel room during their tryst.
-   In _Jupiter's Legacy_, Chloe and Nick knock plaster from the walls in her apartment just by bumping up against them while kissing during their foreplay.

    Music 

-   The song "Lover's Day" by TV on the Radio.
-   "Stingwray" by Static-X.
-   "Oceanographer's Choice" by the Mountain Goats details (an inevitably brief) reconciliation and subsequent destructive sex of the recurring Alpha Couple.
    
    _And then we fell down, and we locked arms. We knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor_
    
-   "Leavin' Love All Over The Place" by George Jones:
    
    _The lady at the rooming house_
    
    _Served our eviction notice yesterday._
    
    _While we were pickin' up our clothes_
    
    _She started screaming somebody's gonna pay._
    
    _She said it takes a dozen carpenters_
    
    _To fix the broken bed and drapes_
    
    _But we just never learned to love_
    
    _Without leavin' love all over the place._
    
-   Apocalyptic by Halestorm is about a relationship that's broken down to the point where sex is the only thing they enjoy together, so before they break up, Lzzy wants one more night and goes into details about how destructive it's going to get.

-   One sourcebook for _Exalted_ mentions one particularly deranged Exalted who fell in love with a _mountain_ and built a magical device to allow him to have sex with it. The mountain enjoyed it quite a bit. Sadly, its equivalent of an orgasm was to _erupt_, causing mass devastation.

    Video Games 

-   Parodied in /flirt emotes in _World of Warcraft_, particularly the Draenei, Night Elf, Troll and Orc ones. Sadly, some of the Draenei Noodle Incident emotes were not present in the released version.
    
    -   Unfortunately, most of the female Draenei flirts were removed.
    
    "When enraged and in heat, a female troll can mate up to 80 times in one night. Be ya prepared?"
    
-   _Knights of the Old Republic_: Heavily implied among the Echani. Depending upon the circumstances, a series of duels between two members of the opposite sex can be construed as a courtship of sorts; and individual duels can be interpreted as flirting or possibly foreplay.
    -   The Handmaiden (half-Echani, raised as one) fights several unarmed duels with the player character along the course of her romance subplot. During the duels, both participants are wearing their underclothes (from the dialogue, they're supposed to be naked, but the game engine doesn't allow that). A hand-to-hand duel between the two turning into sex isn't a stretch of the imagination. (Admit it, that was what you were thinking, too.) Kreia even points this out at one point, asking the Exile why he thinks she's been so eager to get naked and sweaty with him.
-   It's implied in _Gears of War_ that the Locust breed this way. Due to their Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism, the female Locust Drones, a.k.a. _Berserkers_, are gigantic piles of muscle, bulletproof skin, and Unstoppable Rage that indiscriminately slaughter any living thing in their path whether its human or a fellow Locust. Because of this, they have to be chained down while mating to avoid the male Locust getting torn apart.
-   Travis Touchdown finally got with Sylvia at almost the end of _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_. The "No More Heroes" sign outside falls to read "More Ero" and during, you can very clearly hear _gunshots_.
-   In _Mass Effect 2_, Mordin can give Shepard advice regarding whichever crew member the Commander ends up romancing. For Jack, Mordin cautions that Shepard might get injured by her during sex, and suggests using biotic inhibitors (and padding the walls). Jack is the only biotic love interest, there are six in total, for whom this is considered an issue.
-   In _Dark Watch_, you vampire bite the girl during sex, then she comes back and uses her new powers to destroy the organization.
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_ has this conversation between Sten and Morrigan regarding sex:
    
    **Morrigan:** You seem so deep in thought, my dear Sten. Thinking of me, perhaps? The two of us, together at last?
    
    **Sten:** Yes.
    
    **Morrigan:** I... what did you say?
    
    **Sten:** You will need armor, I think. And a helmet. And something to bite down on. How strong are human teeth?
    
    **Morrigan:** How strong are my teeth?
    
    **Sten:** Qunari teeth can bite through leather, wood, even metal given time. Which reminds me, I may try to nuzzle.
    
    **Morrigan:** Nuzzle?
    
    **Sten:** If that happens, you'll need an iron pry bar. Heat it in a fire, first, or it may not get my attention.
    
    **Morrigan:** Perhaps it would be better if we did not proceed.
    
    **Sten:** Are you certain? If it will satisfy your curiosity...
    
    **Morrigan:** Yes. Yes, I think it is best.
    
    -   Sten is _probably_ kidding here. His race does have Made of Iron as a hat, but prior to this point, Morrigan had been engaging in increasingly suggestive dialog with Sten in an attempt to fluster (or get any reaction at all) out of him and as several other conversations reveal, Sten does have an extremely dry sense of humor that he enjoys unleashing on the unsuspecting. When the player is given (or is) a Qunari love-interest in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, none of Sten's claims are an issue.
-   Moira from _Dead In Vinland_ claims to have done this with one of her numerous past sex partners. While Moira is a witch, there was no super strength or superpowers involved; they just "did it against the wall so hard" that the wall fell down.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Chop Chop Fruit salad Mystery Jam DokiDoki Dating Sim THingy_: Apple and Banana flood the room with their "fruit juice" every time they have sex in the latter's good ending, causing repeated property damage. Apple thinks it's worth it.

    Web Animation 

-   _Ultra Fast Pony:_ In "Pirate Shipping," Big Mac and Cheerilee get married while rip-roaring drunk. The next morning, they wake up together on a mattress, which is at the bottom of an 8-foot-deep hole. "This hole wasn't even here yesterday!"
-   _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_ posits that the main reason the Emperor never suspected the existence of the Sensei, his _actual_ biological children (unlike the Primarchs, who were more like clones) was that every time he had sex, the woman tended to end up rather mauled (he mentions blood and broken bones were usual), and, while he made sure they never ended up unsatisfied, he never bothered to return to check on any of them.

    Webcomics 

-   Jägers in the _Girl Genius_ universe seem to think this is just how it's done since they consider being physically wounded after hitting on Von Pinn as not so much "Emphatic, murderous NO!" as "A bit of teasing". After all, she _could_ kill or incapacitate them with very little effort.
    
    **von Pinn:** Move or die!
    
    -   It's mentioned in the background material that she's been thinking about killing one of them to send a stronger message, but that she's afraid it would be the _wrong_ message.
    -   Of course, while Jägerkin believe in Love at First Punch, her charges think she's "warning them off". But now that her background is revealed, she may have used an opportunity simply to keep them in good fighting form... and vent her perpetual nasty mood.
-   Walky and Joyce's first night together. Lampshaded by the motel clerks who were getting complaints about their "enthusiasm", but were reluctant to go tell them to keep it down due to recognizing their SEMME uniforms:
    
    **Clerk 1:** You saw 'em! They had the stripes!
    
    **Clerk 2:** And you know what **that** means.
    
    **Clerk 2:** No, Laughing Boy, **think**. "Man of Steel, Woman of Steel, **Bed** of Kleenex."
    
    -   And inside the room:
        
        **Walky:** (_tangled in a heap with Joyce, surveying the remains of the room—utterly wrecked save for the chair_) Whew...whew...uh...Joyce, we kinda...should we...
        
        **Joyce:** The chair! THE CHAIR!
        
-   Subverted nicely in this _The Order of the Stick_ comic:
    
    **Sabine:** You can do anything you want with me... You can't honestly tell me this didn't cross your mind while we were fighting, can you? I promise: this time, when I manhandle you, it will feel a LOT better.
    
    **Roy:** Anything I want, you say?
    
    **Sabine:** Anything.
    
    **Roy:** Hey, you were right. That DID feel better than before. Nice piercings, though.
    
    -   Especially awesome given that her supernatural combat enhancements had just worn off, so she was trying to continue to distract Roy by stripping. Also, she's a shapeshifter and a succubus attempting to drain levels via sexual contact.
-   The Cherub mating ritual in _Homestuck_ is described as an outright battle, wherein the two transform into massive serpents, each an astronomical unit in length to beat the tar out of each other to determine whether the "benevolent protector of justice" cherub or the "malevolent destroyer of worlds" cherub will lose and bear their offspring, while the winner gains control over both their galactic territories. Oh, and it all takes place in a _black hole_.
-   _Sandra on the Rocks_: Domenico and his ex-wife, Zoe, end up doing this for _an hour_ after another of their shouting matches. It takes place entirely off-panel to show Sandra's reaction, accompanied by the sounds of breaking furniture (including a Priceless Ming Vase). She even asks if they're fighting or f\*cking.
-   According to the December 12, 2014 installment of _Las Lindas_, Mora and Minos have a rather... _vigorous_ relationship. Hopefully, they have earthquake insurance!
-   _Questionable Content_ plays the trope relatively subtly here after Faye and Bubbles' first time together. Somewhat justified in that Bubbles is a larger-than-human robot with a combat-rated chassis, but Faye is a buff, but otherwise normal, squidgy human. There's no _visible_ damage, but...
    
    **Bubbles**: I fear we have fatally compromised the structural integrity of this bed.
    
    **Faye**: Good point. Let's hit the junkyard tomorrow and see if we can find a cheap truck suspension.
    
    -   Played with later, with encounters between May and Sven. Where it's the participants who get damaged: May (an ex-con A.I. in a substandard body) leaks lubricant at her seams. Sven finds out later that the lubricant is mildly corrosive to human hair. When they go at it again, one of May's legs pops off at the hip. This is not seen as a reason to stop by the participants.
-   Whatever it is _Oglaf_ and Goat Girl do on the hilltop after GG announces penis-in-vagina isn't really sex results in explosions, Oglaf's sheep running away, and in one case a volcanic eruption.
-   In _The Whiteboard_, Miki repeatedly shows signs of injuries (but not displeasure) after sex. Also, Doc and Cara, being polar bears, break the bed.

    Web Original 

-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   It seems Saiyans can't have sex without blasting their signature attacks through the roof of whatever building they're in. Vegeta and Goku do this in episode 34 and 55, respectively. A deleted scene from the Future Trunks film would have had Gohan doing the same.
    -   It turns out it's not limited to Saiyans. Krillin does the same when he has sex with 18 at the end of episode 60 and destroys the Krillin Owned Counter once they're finally done.

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_: In one episode, Roger is attracted to a pink, furry female alien, who promptly leaves the middle of their dinner with the Smith family to do it one floor above the dining room. The Smiths are forced to overhear their VERY loud love-making as the couple cause the ceiling above the Smiths to crack and smash down a chandelier. This prompts Stan to take his family out to a restaurant, but they can STILL hear Roger and his hookup doing it!
-   _The Venture Brothers_, Brock Samson and Molotov Cocktease's entire relationship. Hell, Brock has a rule against killing women and children... but such things as cutting out Molotov's eye or getting handcuffed to a bed in a burning building are nothing more than _foreplay_ to them.
    
    **Molotov:** You took my eye!
    
    **Brock:** After you took... my heart.
    
    -   Not to mention the motel room they trashed while Brock was trying to get his rocks off.
-   Mortal enemies Æon Flux and Trevor Goodchild have been known to make out on the battlefield.
-   _Futurama_, between Lrrr and Ndnd in the episode "Spanish Fry".
    
    **Lrrr:** You will want to retreat to a safe 500-meter radius!
    
    -   Bender and the Beverage Machine in "The Bots and the Bees."
-   In the _The Simpsons_ _Treehouse of Horror XVIII_ segment _Mr. & Mrs. Simpson_, an obvious parody of _Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)_, Homer and Marge are assassins and destroy the entire house trying to kill each other. After Marge kills Chief Wiggum, she and Homer have sex over his corpse causing even more damage to the living room, such as knocking over a bowl of fruit and smashing a glass case.
-   Sterling Archer could give master classes in this. His "two-man three-way" in "Skorpio" left a room in shambles with chocolate handprints (and prints of other body parts) covering the walls. Then Archer literally destroys the room with a hand grenade.
    -   His trysts with Pam seem to always be Destructo-Nookie, after which he is often unable to move.
    -   Part 2 of "Heart of Archness" starts with Archer and two island girls in bed. He praises the girls, "I've never even _heard_ of that position. Did the missionaries not swing by here or—."
        
        **Archer:** Noah, I'm half-drunk and slathered in... every bodily fluid there is. This is about as "pirate kingy" as I'm going to get.
        
-   In _Batman: Assault on Arkham_, Deadshot and Harley Quinn get intimate at one point. We don't see most of it, but the sounds of crashing and furniture breaking are audible from outside.
-   Cornfed of _Duckman_ has sex with the titular character's sister in law (otherwise he would've died within a half hour) and it shakes the entire house, causing shelving and the TV to fall over, and somehow causing wiring to come loose. Duckman himself is surprisingly oblivious the entire time.
