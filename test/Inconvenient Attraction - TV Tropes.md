**Ned:** What's the matter, Linda?

**Linda:** _(Looks up at him. A moment, then)_ I love the boy, Neddy.

Sometimes people fall in love (or other, more superficial forms of attraction) and _hate_ it. Not just the circumstances that prevent them from acting on their love, or the disappointment that inevitably results, but the feeling of love itself. For these people, the Love Epiphany is a This Is Gonna Suck moment, and they wish with all their hearts they could fall _out_ of love.

There are many possible reasons for this. They may think that Love Is a Weakness, and thus wish to avoid being in love with anyone. Or they may be fine with love in general, but find the other person problematic for some reason. Or the timing might just be bad. Whatever the reason, it is their _specific_ feelings of attraction for a _particular_ person that they find upsetting.

The situation may resolve itself in a variety of ways. Often, the circumstances that make the attraction inconvenient will gradually be cleared away, freeing the person to pursue a relationship with their loved one. Alternatively, circumstances may stay the same, but the person may overcome their resistance and decide to pursue a relationship in spite of them. Admitting one's feeling openly and allowing oneself to work through one's disappointment with the help and support of others is rare, but not unheard of. A few lucky folks even succeed in falling out of love.

Decidedly Truth in Television.

Tends to affect characters who know that Love Hurts. Sub Tropes include Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny, which is for characters who are anti-sex and therefore feel disgusted by their own sexual feelings, and Bigot with a Crush, when a character has feelings for someone from a group that they are prejudiced towards. Stupid Sexy Friend can be a cause of this, while Tsundere can be a result. If it leads to a breakup between the subject and their partner, expect them to explain that It's Not You, It's Me. Often related to Forbidden Love. Also see Ladykiller in Love.

Contrast In Love with Love.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Expecting to Fall into Ruin, I Aim to Become a Blacksmith_: Kururi panics upon first meeting Iris and being attracted to her, because he has Media Transmigration foreknowledge that he will end up marrying Eliza, who can be a terrifying Woman Scorned. Iris takes advantage of this to tease him occasionally.
-   In _Koi Kaze_, Koshiro has an epic freak-out when he discovers that the girl he just met - and felt the first sparks of a romantic connection with over the course of the afternoon - is actually his younger sister, who he hadn't seen since she was only five and their mother took sole custody of after divorcing their father. Both he and his sister Nanoka struggle to come to terms with their growing attraction towards one another through the story.
-   In _Medaka Box_, Zenkichi freaks out when he finally figures out he is in love with Medaka and wants to date her, because he thinks the fact he has these feelings makes him a despicable and horrible person who barely deserves to live, as they mean he has only been supporting Medaka _the majority of both of their lives_ for a selfish reason.
-   In _My Monster Secret_, Aizawa Nagisa is distraught to find herself in love with the main character Asahi. Not only she rejected him harshly the previous year (where she hadn't fallen in love yet), but also she knows that her close friend Youko is in love with Asahi, too, and that he loves her back. It becomes even more of a problem in part 2, when Asahi and Youko effectively become a couple, but Nagisa still can't let it go, as much as she would like to. Even later on Shiho, Youko's childhood friend has the same problem when her long-denied feelings for Asahi start to surface. Unlike Nagisa, though, she manages to move on once she confesses.
-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, Yue tries to support her Best Friend Nodoka and her feelings for Negi, but her own developing feelings for him eventually get discovered and she freaks out about it.

She's assured that there's nothing wrong with the way she feels and is encouraged to pursue Negi herself.
-   Played with in _One Piece_: One strange trait that is found in all rulers of the Kuja Tribe is that when they fall in love, it literally hurts them to the point of making them sick and eventually killing them. When the current ruler, Boa Hancock, starts feeling love for the main character Luffy, she gets sick and feared that it'll kill her. Elder Nyon, a former ruler and Hancock's mother figure of sorts, says that said previous rulers got sick and died because they vehemently tried to deny their feelings; the only way to survive it is to accept that you're in love with someone, just like Nyon did. So Hancock becomes more open to Luffy about her feelings (although he doesn't reciprocate) and she ends up being well.
-   In _Ouran High School Host Club_, Haruhi eventually finds out that she's in love with Tamaki, a revelation she completely freaks out at and tries her best at denying, spending a whole chapter basically running around in panic before going to bed sick.
