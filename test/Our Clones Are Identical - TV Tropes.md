_"Cloning, wow. Who would have thought? There should be a list of people who can and cannot clone themselves."_

An index of tropes having to do with clones and cloning. Not to be confused with tropes about twins. Nor are these about characters who are merely similar to other characters. This index is about duplicate people. Also closely related to the Doppelgänger index.

## Tropes involving cloning:

-   Artificial Human: Any person who was created in a laboratory as a clone of another person is this trope by definition.
-   Artificial Meat: Meat that was grown in a laboratory from cloned animal cells.
-   Body Backup Drive: When a person dies, their mind gets transferred into a fresh cloned body.
-   Born as an Adult: As clones in fiction typically enter the world the same age as the individuals they were cloned from, they are usually this trope by default.

-   Clones Are People, Too: Clones are regarded as real human beings worthy of equal rights, instead of just being expendable duplicates that can be easily replaced.
