_"Got no human grace, your eyes without a face."_

As other tropes indicate, eyes are very, very meaningful. It's a cliché to call them windows to the soul. This trope reminds us that alone, eyeballs are fragile spheres of gel only vaguely reminiscent of their usual purpose of subtle social cues. So a single eye completely outside the context of a face is just creepy. Bad guys often favor a singular, unblinking, Faceless Eye as an insignia— bonus points if said villain is The Omniscient Council of Vagueness that runs a dystopian society of unending surveillance ala The Illuminati. Even without an ominous Big Bad attached, the prospect of a thousand eyeballs shooting you to death with Eye Beams is fundamentally more unsettling than a thousand Mooks with Energy Weapons. Fighting them usually leads to "Go for the Eye". A Cosmic Horror Story can involve a vague entity such as an Eldritch Abomination whose eyes are one of the few things to be recognized with the remainder of its body being too horrid to describe and its actions being too alien to understand.

A cyclops character is more relatable than this kind of being, since cyclopes have a recognizable facial structure, with at least a mouth. These examples are far beyond the edges of the Uncanny Continent. It is also interesting to note that the representations of many insane AIs use this trope — most likely to underscore their creepiness.

Of course, being long past the Uncanny Valley already, these examples often also involve Technicolor Eyes, Hellish Pupils, and Red Eyes, Take Warning. Contrast The Blank and Eyeless Face. If an eye is on a part of the body other than the face, it's Eyes Do Not Belong There. See also Oculothorax for monsters whose body is primarily an eyeball.

Not to be confused with _Eyes Without a Face_.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Planet 51_ has these as the alien invaders (on an alien world) in a movie set in the classic sense of 1950s B-movies and it features a whole bunch of them in the closing credits (of the actual film).
-   Two submissions in _The Mind's Eye_ series. Both "Too Far" from _Beyond_ and "Nuvogue" from _The Gate_ feature segments with large, bare eyeballs acting like perfectly normal people. Mostly, they seem to like watching TV. They even come in varieties: one segment features a teenage eyeball moving out of its folks' house, and another shows a whole family right down to a dog eyeball on the floor. "Nuvogue" becomes especially cringe-worthy when, after a pair of eyeballs short out their TV from constantly bouncing on the remote to change the channel, one floats over and starts tackling the TV in order to fix it.
-   The Spot from _Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse_ has a round black blot where his face should be that expands and contracts with his mood. When combined with his white skin, it makes his entire head resemble an eyeball.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Lord of the Rings_: Sauron's emblem is the fiery Lidless Eye. He's physically depicted as such in The Movies— which makes him a living Clear Eyes ad, only without Ben Stein, and therefore, slightly less frightening.

-   _The President's Analyst_ has a scene (that's curiously gone missing) where James Coburn is shocked to discover there are indeed spies following him including _his girlfriend_ and freaks out, seeing disembodied looming eyeballs everywhere (with footage pulled from the 1961 3-D movie "The Mask").
-   _Horrific_: The monster in the _Terror Vision_ segment is a giant floating eyeball.
-   _Flight of the Navigator_: When David meets the other living specimens aboard the Trimaxion Drone Ship, one of them is a creature inside a darkened tank which initially appears to have a face — but when it opens its "mouth", it reveals itself to be a giant eyeball (and lets out a piercing shriek that sounds a lot like "eyeyeyeyeye...")
-   In _Patrick Still Lives_, whenever the title character uses his powers, the image of his disembodied eyes appears on screen.

    Literature 

-   _The Lord of the Rings_ and the Eye of Sauron. To quote Saruman: "His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf: a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame." Unlike in the movies, it's not made clear that Sauron is simply embodied as one big eye, but the Eye does manifest as described at least in the Mirror of Galadriel, and about the only thing seen of Sauron in his tower is his gaze, like an evil searchlight. From other material, it seems he's not exactly embodied at all.
-   _A Series of Unfortunate Events_'s odious Count Olaf has a tattoo of an eye on his ankle, and eyes are a recurring motif throughout the books.

-   In "The Haunter of the Dark" by H. P. Lovecraft, the eponymous creature (one of Nyarlathotep's many avatars) does have a body (some kind of winged, tentacled Living Shadow / Eldritch Abomination type thing), but its distinguishing feature is a huge three-lobed burning eye.

-   In Victor Hugo's poem _La Conscience_, Cain is driven mad by an eye constantly watching him wherever he goes (representing his guilt over killing his brother). He ends up sealing himself into a grave to escape the eye, leading to the ending verse, which has become famous in French literature: "The eye was in the tomb and stared at Cain".
-   _Alien in a Small Town:_ The alien Jan, rather than a head, just have a huge eyestalk with a jet black "eyesphere" on top. See the image on the book's page.
-   The titular "Eye in the Sky" in the Philip K. Dick novel of the same name is the gigantic, all-seeing eye of God that is in part a manifestation of a old man's worldview. Several people were transported into his mind after a particle accelerator accident forms a gestalt consciousness.

    -   _Ultraman Ace_: Right in the beginning of episode 5, the sky cracks open, as it usually does whenever monsters from Yapool's Dimension comes into the human world, but all there is to be seen is a single, bug-like eye. Which belongs to Giron Man, one of Yapool's servants, who is silently observing the city and planning his later assault on the human world.

    _Within the darkness there is a deeper darkness. And within that deeper darkness is an eye, an ancient eye, an eye whose white has turned yellow with age.

-   Rularuu Watchers in _City of Heroes_. Giant eyeballs with _teeth-edged eyelids_. The also tend to gaze around in sync when idle, indicating even more that they are all connected to the same mind.

-   _Wild ARMs 3_ loves this, having three bosses that fit this bill, Mono-eye Titan, Hecto-eye Titan, and Heimdall. The first two are faced consecutively without a chance to save in between, and the third is a powerful Super Boss.
-   _Witcheye_ sees you playing as _one_. You're a witch transformed into a floating eyeball and must find a way to revert yourself back.

-   Speaking of _Guitar Hero_, Neversoft's corporate logo<small>◊</small> from 1999 to 2014 has a faceless eye that was impaled with a spear for their "O". Most of their Vanity Plates for the _Tony Hawk's Pro Skater_ games (including the short-lived _Underground_ sub-series) play with this; not so much for their _Guitar Hero_ plates.
-   And speaking of Rhythm Games, one of the _Rock Band_ venues has a gigantic image of an eyeball (which appears to look in different directions during the performance) at the back of the stage. Surrounded by rings of teeth with tentacles coming out of the back of the stage.

-   Wizeman in _NiGHTS into Dreams…_, more or less. His eyes are in his hands, not his face.

-   In _Eversion_, normal enemies turn into faceless eyes in world X-4.
-   The personality cores form _Portal_ are all talking spheres with one eye in the centre. The most notable of the bunch is Wheatley from _Portal 2_.
-   _.hack_: Corbenik's third and final form is a massive floating eye, with hundreds of similar eyes flying about in the background (which is weird, since Corbenik's first two forms were a seed and a leaf... how does that trend continue to eye?)
-   _Heroes of Might and Magic III_ has two examples, both are giant eyes on tentacles, the Beholder/Evil Eye creature and the Seer's Eye, which works as a typical videogame security camera.
    -   _Might and Magic V_ has a monster called a "Beholder Bat" which is, in essence, a bat with one small eye and one huge eyeball attached under it. And it shoots lasers that inflict fire damage. Seriously.
-   The Gran Centurio of _Yggdra Union_ features a disembodied eye as its pommel jewel, which is unnerving if you notice it, but not brought up in the storyline of the main game. The side materials inform us that yes, _this is actually someone's eye,_ which he himself tore out to use in the sword's forging.
-   The Geth, Mecha-Mooks who form the forces of the Big Bad in the first Mass Effect, have long heads terminating in glowing "eyes" and nothing else except armour, with one character commenting that they have "flashlight heads". They're portrayed in a less overtly hostile light in the sequel... conveniently coinciding with a Geth "character" gaining something closer to a face. Added for good reason; Legion's headflaps were specifically installed to help it/him/them emote to players and characters, since otherwise Legion could not easily convey body language and facial expressions.
-   _Halo_: 343 Guilty Spark and the other Forerunner Monitors are robotic versions.
-   One of the player models in _Quake III: Arena_ - Orbb - is a giant eye with legs.

-   Kineticlops from _War of the Monsters_ is a vaguely humanoid Energy Being focused around one giant eye.
-   The 2011 Halowe'en update in Team Fortress 2 introduced MONOCULUS!, a giant floating eyeball which launches smaller eyeballs as rockets when it's pissed. It's backstory is that the spirit in the Bombonomicon, an eldrich tome of explosives, haunted the Demoman's eye.
-   The Mogall and Arch Mogall monster classes in _Fire Emblem Gaiden_ and _Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones_.

-   Ur-Example for video games in the Ur First Person Shooter, the players in _Mazewar_ are represented as these.
-   _Iggy's Reckin' Balls_ has I-Ball, who is, well, an eyeball. His high-pitched, kind of nerdy voice lightens the creepy factor, but his painful scream upon being hurt and the fact that he grapples with what appears to be a _spear_ (conjuring images of Eye Scream) cranks it back up.
-   In _Cookie Clicker_, this is revealed to be the final form of Santa Claus, as of version 1.0402.
-   Dimensional Doors Mod in _Minecraft_: In Limbo, directly above the player is always a giant red eye staring down at them.

-   Vel'koz from _League of Legends_.
-   _Catacomb Abyss_ features giant, man-sized blooshot floating eyes which shoot fireballs from their pupils. _Catacomb Apocalypse_ has tiny, grey floating eyes which appear on some levels; unusually, they are not enemies, but guides who lead the player along the right path (though it's hard to keep pace with them, and easy to accidentally kill them with your fireballs.)
-   _Chzo_ is shown to have no face, only a strange pink body part and he only has one eye, which he uses to make a New Prince out of Theo near the end of the series.

-   _Bloodborne_ features a lot of eldritch monsters as bosses or enemies, and one of these that definitely fits the description is the Eye of Mensis, a mutated being that may or may not have previously been a Mensis scholar. The brain of the individual is bloated to the point that the rest of the head is gone, and the beast can kill you by just staring at you from across a canyon. The most notable detail besides its gigantic brain are the numerous eyes dotted across it which don't blink and simply stare. You can get a reward after dumping it into the basement of the Nightmare of Mensis by simply walking up to its crippled body, standing before its biggest eye, and performing the "Make Contact" gesture until it responds with a reward.
-   In _Broodstar_, the Seer is an alien creature consisting primarily of a giant eyeball. The Augur is a similar creature which is also covered in spikes.

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_ at one point has a passing reference to Black Mage invoking "my new god, Mst'r Ieb'al". Guess what he looked like.

-   Odineye from _Brat-Halla_ is one of Odin's eyes that he sacrificed to the Well of Wisdom; it escaped and is plotting revenge for its treatment. It doesn't have a lid, but for some reason it does have a brow.
-   _Decrypting Rita_ has the Panopticon, a mysterious group of eyes floating in the void between the Alternate Universes.

-   Ebbirnoth from _Schlock Mercenary_ The fact that Ebbirnoth (and Uniocs in general) have a faceless eye is actually a minor plot point during one of the Credomar arcs-someone "headshots" Ebby, blasting out his eyeball and seriously pissing him off. Schlock realizes the mistake that's been made, and encourages the lieutenant to play dead; the sniper was human, and didn't realize that Unioc brains are kept in a bone cage in their pelvis.
-   In _Tower of God_, Scout has a tool called Observer. In Miseng's case, it is a floating eyeball.
-   At one point _Vexxarr_ encounters some evil plant A.I.s who look like bloodshot eyeballs with some leaves and tendrils added. He also has a Starfish Alien shipmate who is composed entirely of eyestalks, and his own face consists entirely of one huge eye, which is usually glaring/scowling.

    Web Original 

-   _The Fear Mythos_ has the Eye, the original Fear of Judgement with a very creative name.

-   This YouTube video. "There is a giant eyeball and it is looking at us!"
-   Eyeball from _Otherworldly Ravenous Beast_ is just an eyeball with limbs, and they are one of the less creepier examples.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Code Lyoko_, XANA, due to being a computer program with no real physical body, the only real signifier of his presence is the circular Eye of XANA sigil that is used on his monsters and on any electronic he hacks. The closest he gets to physically appearing is in the second last episode as a gigantic, vaguely humanoid, faceless phantom with the afromentioned eye symbol on the chest.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ fought a spherical monster entirely _covered_ with eyes that shot Eye Beams, and couldn't find a way to get close enough to hit it until Blossom finds a way to make it laugh, making it close its eyes upside-down, anime-style.

-   Koh the Face-Stealer _loves_ doing this.
-   On _Regular Show_, Benson orders a surveillance system to keep tabs on Mordecai and Rigby. When it fails, he orders the company's ultimate system: a giant floating eyeball named Peeps. Peeps turns out to far more trouble than he's worth but the Park can't get rid of him because in a rage Benson didn't read that Peep's contract is a "life-time guarantee"; they're stuck with him until they die. Mordecai has to beat Peeps in a staring contest to get rid of him and if Peeps wins he gets all of their eyes (he has a ice cream scoop and pick for the job). The only way the gang wins is by Rigby shooting a laser pointer into Peep's pupils.
-   Lord Hater's mooks and his Dragon Peepers on _Wander over Yonder_ have eyeballs for heads.
-   Shockwave from Transformers, in G1 it even flashed (Like Wheeljack's 'ears') when he spoke.
-   Bill Cipher from _Gravity Falls_ is this being that he's shaped like the Eye of Providence.
-   An early concept for Leela in _Futurama_ experimented with making her one of these, as opposed to the more conventional Cyclops design she ended up with.
