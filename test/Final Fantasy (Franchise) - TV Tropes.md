"_I don't think I have what it takes to make a good action game. I think I'm better at telling a story._"

— **Hironobu Sakaguchi**, before the creation of _Final Fantasy_

**For the first game in the series, please see _Final Fantasy._**

The pride and joy of Square Enix (formerly Squaresoft), _Final Fantasy_ is a hand-rubbingly popular fantasy JRPG franchise, currently on its sixteenth iteration alongside multiple sequels, spinoffs, remakes and films.

The series is highly regarded for its outstanding production values and gameplay, and for being a pioneer in the Eastern RPG (or "JRPG") genre. Many of the conventions that didn't originate in _Dragon Quest_ originated with the _Final Fantasy_ series, which in turn was influenced by _Ultima_ and other Western computer role playing games. Each new _Final Fantasy_ game attempts to re-invent itself with new gameplay innovations or approaches, and although this can be divisive to the fanbase, credit is generally given to their attempts to at least _try_ something different in the heavily-stagnant and conservative JRPG genre. This also adds a bit of Fridge Brilliance to the title. Despite its status as one of the Long Runners, none of the main _Final Fantasy_ games are the same exact thing twice, and each game is indeed the final time we'll see that particular combination of gameplay mechanics, as the franchise does not revisit itself; for a long time, it was resistant to sequels and spinoffs, and when they finally occurred they still featured gameplay that was distinct from the original.

The series was fairly obscure for a long time in the west, before exploding in popularity with the release of _Final Fantasy VII_, which exposed most people to the JRPG genre for the first time. It is still widely regarded as one of the best RPGs (eastern or otherwise) of all time. Since then, _Final Fantasy_ is widely considered the gold standard of JRPGs in the west, and is held in such regard that the English localizations are now developed concurrently with the original production.

Tracking the early parts of the _Final Fantasy_ series can be confusing, as only three of the first six games made it to North America, where the numbers were changed so that the US releases were consecutive numbers. _Final Fantasy IV_ was released in America as _Final Fantasy II_, while _Final Fantasy VI_ was released as _Final Fantasy III_. The confusion doesn't end there, as four games were given the name "Final Fantasy" to increase sales in North America: the first three games of the _SaGa (RPG)_ series (renamed to _Final Fantasy Legend_ I-III) and the first installment in the _World of Mana_ series (released as _Final Fantasy Adventure_). _Final Fantasy VII_ broke this trend and was released as "VII" everywhere, and from that point on, every release except for the Virtual Console versions of IV and VI (the latter was titled III on the SNES Classic) would bear the original numbering.

This series was also one of the first Japanese games made by someone other than Namco or Nintendo to reach US shores and capitalize on that market. Later Japanese developers would take notice and break onto the US scene; one equally-popular series which took advantage of this trend was _Dragon Quest_, Enix's Cash-Cow Franchise (_Shin Megami Tensei_, Atlus's own cash cow franchise, would also make the jump to the west for the same reason). _Final Fantasy_ and _Dragon Quest_ were direct competitors as far back as the the NES days; following the Square-Enix merger, SMT and _Final Fantasy_ are currently competing in both countries. Meanwhile, _Dragon Quest_ has quietly found a niche market outside of Japan, though it remains king in its home country.

While the series stuck firmly to a policy of one game per number for a long time, in more recent times the franchise has opened up to the idea of sequels and multimedia spinoffs. _Final Fantasy X_ was the first to get a direct sequel (_X-2_); _XIII_ was the first to get a whole trilogy; _VII_ became a franchise in its own right; and _Final Fantasy Tactics_ was the first to have a compilation of different games set in the same universe, known as the _Ivalice Alliance_.

## The _Final Fantasy_ series consists of:

    open/close all folders 

    Main Series 

-   _Final Fantasy_ (1987): The world is shrouded in darkness. The wind stops, the sea is wild, the earth begins to rot, and fire's been acting pretty sketchy, too. It's up to the four wayward Warriors of Light to rekindle the Crystals that control the elements. But the story contains more surprises than the opening crawl would have one think.
    -   Released on: Nintendo Entertainment System (Wii, 3DS (JP), Wii U (JP), NES Classic (NA, EU)), MSX2 (JP), WonderSwan Color (JP), PlayStation (PlayStation Network), Game Boy Advance, PlayStation Portable, Mobile, PC, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch
-   _Final Fantasy II_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (1988): A cruel Emperor has made a pact with the devil, swarming the world with demonic troops. It's up to a ragtag resistance movement to slow the Empire's progress; stopping the Emperor may prove impossible. Rather than pick warrior classes at the outset, players gradually mold their characters' skills through the use of spells and weapons. Though novel, most fans remember _II_ as the one where clubbing yourself with a sword increased HP. Introduced the concept of guest characters joining the party, including the series' very first Dragoon.
    -   Released on: Famicom (JP, Wii (JP), Nintendo 3DS (JP), Wii U (JP)), WonderSwan Color (JP), PS1 (PSN), GBA, PSP, Mobile, PC, PS4, Switch
-   _Final Fantasy III_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (1990): Four youths are tapped by a mysterious crystal to restore balance to the elements and defeat a sorcerer named Xande who has strengthened himself with a mysterious power. Took a page from _Dragon Quest III_ by implementing a Job System, allowing characters to switch classes at will, and threw players a curveball with its expanding overworld. (Though an airship is found early on, upgrades are required to float over mountains and other nuisances.) Known for having a very difficult final dungeon. Was never released outside of Japan until a full 3D remake on DS in 2006. A variant of the original 2D version of the game was finally released outside of Japan in 2021 alongside new versions of _I_ and _II_ as a part of the _Pixel Remaster_ series.
    -   Original released on: Famicom (JP; Wii, Wii U, 3DS, Famicom Classic), PC, Mobile, PS4, Switch
    -   Remake released on: Nintendo DS, PSP, Ouya, Mobile, PC
-   _Final Fantasy IV_ (1991): When Cecil, the man in charge of the empire's flying battalion of doom, grows weary of harassing innocent people, his paranoid King fires him. Big mistake. _IV_ had the most gripping storyline in the series yet, with a massive rotating cast, multiple overworlds (à la _III_), and an overarching theme of redemption. Like _III_, it later received a full 3D remake.
    -   Original released on Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Wii, Wii U (JP), 3DS (JP)), PS1 (PSN), WonderSwan Color, GBA (Wii U (JP)), PSP, PC, Mobile, PS4, Switch
    -   Remake released on DS, Mobile, PC
-   _Final Fantasy V_ (1992): The elements are dying off, the King of Tycoon has gone missing, and it somehow all ties into an asteroid which crashed just outside the castle, narrowly missing a young wanderer named Bartz. The job system makes a comeback with a whopping 22 jobs (plus an additional four in the GBA version), and the new feature of being able to carry over abilities from one job for use in another makes this the most customizable _FF_ title outside of _Tactics_.
    -   Released on: Super Famicom (JP, Wii (JP), Wii U (JP), 3DS (JP)), PS1 (PSN), GBA, Mobile, PC, PS4, Switch
-   _Final Fantasy VI_ (1994): _FF_ begins its steady march toward cyberpunk with this steampunk adventure, set a thousand years after a world-destroying magical war. A megalomaniacal Emperor has discovered a way to revive the lost power of magic through artificial means, which serves as the start of foreboding cataclysm. The job system is shelved, yet again, though the character classes themselves have been rolled into 14 unique player characters. The most aesthetically and musically stunning _FF_ of its era, pushing the SNES to its limits. For many, this game marks the point where Square became a god-tier developer.
    -   Released on: SNES (Wii, Wii U (JP), SNES Classic), PS1 (PSN), GBA (Wii U (JP)), Mobile, PC, PS4, Switch
-   _Final Fantasy VII_ (1997): Set in a gritty Diesel Punk world, the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE stages bombings on the facilities of an energy conglomerate which mines the planet's life force as fuel… which soon gets upended when a presumed-deceased mercenary by the name of Sephiroth sets out to bring the world's downfall on orders from his Lovecraftian mother, prompting AVALANCHE’s latest recruit and Sephiroth’s former comrade, Cloud Strife, to lead his new comrades after him in a bid to save the world. The most well-known installment in the series, as well as one of the most well-known video games in general, _VII_ marked the peak of the JRPG craze, and while not a PS1 launch title, it was the biggest incentive for gamers to buy the console. It also boasts the largest Expanded Universe of any entry, collectively called the _Compilation of Final Fantasy VII_.
    -   Original released on: PS1 (PSN, PlayStation Classic), PC, Mobile, PS4, Switch, Xbox One
-   _Final Fantasy VIII_ (1999): _VII_ was a hard act to follow, but _VIII_ proved a solid (if esoteric) successor: Squall Leonhart attends a military academy which prepares teenagers for war against the Sorceress, who has risen to power and is imposing her iron fist on the world. The 'school days' plots borrow a few notes from _Shin Megami Tensei_, and are regarded by many as the game's high points. Gameplay deviated from the norm by using the "junction" system for battles.
    -   Released on: PS1 (PSN), PC, PS4, XBO, Switch
-   _Final Fantasy IX_ (2000): _IX_ is a throwback to the NES/SNES titles, right down to the Super-Deformed characters, a four-man party, a medieval fantasy world, and mythology gags related to past games. A princess engineers her own kidnapping in order to be free of her despotic mother, who has recently come under the influence of a strange Arms Dealer. A world-spanning adventure follows, involving the would-be kidnapper, a princess in disguise, her loyal knight, and a young mage struggling with his existence. Notable for being one of the more philosophical entries in the series despite its bright and cheery packaging, and Revisiting the Roots from an aesthetic standpoint after previous titles featured prominent Science Fiction elements.
    -   Released on: PS1 (PSN), Mobile, PC, PS4, XBO, Switch
-   _Final Fantasy X_ (2001): Star-athlete Tidus is pulled through time, washing up in a post-apocalyptic future where technology is outlawed and cities are constantly attacked by an immortal Eldritch Abomination. His only path home, or so it seems, is to accompany a group of pilgrims on their journey to make the land peaceful again. The first fully-voiced _FF_ title, with a competent English dub. Also experimented with Conditional Turn-Based mechanics (CTB), which affected turn order depending on the action selected. Though successful, it was soon discarded in favor of more modern Active Time Battle systems.
    -   Released on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PS4, PC, Switch, XBO
-   _Final Fantasy XI_ (2002, expansions released from 2003-2015): An MMORPG set in the fantasy world of Vana'diel. Still reeling from the aftermath of a great war with "the Shadow Lord" twenty years prior, three nations brace themselves when the Shadow Lord's Beast Tribe minions organize themselves into a coherent force once again. Like _XIV_ after it, numerous expansions led to an extensive and evolving storyline. Known for being particularly brutal (amongst the most brutal games in the series, for that matter). The most profitable title in the series, by virtue of running a paid subscription service for over ten years.
    -   Released on: PS2, PC, Xbox 360. The service for the console versions was closed in 2016.
-   _Final Fantasy XII_ (2006): The first main game to be published following the merger with Enix, the first mainline entry in the _Ivalice Alliance_, and arguably the flagship title of that collection. Things are looking grim for Ivalice when Dalmasca, the biggest obstacle to the Archadian Empire, falls overnight after their king is murdered by one of his own knights. However, something about the whole mess doesn't add up, and a team of adventurers — including a destitute princess, a pair of sky pirates, and an orphan from the streets — are compelled to break the supposed traitor out of jail and discover the truth. The gameplay of _XII_ is modeled on a MMORPG, but with linear quests and various characters/races/summons from _Tactics_.
    -   Released on: PS2, PS4, PC, Switch, XBO
-   _Final Fantasy XIII_ (2009): The story takes place in the floating, isolationist mini-Dyson sphere of Cocoon. Several hundred years ago, a "War of Transgression" took place between Cocoon and the vast, lush, primeval surface world, Pulse. Since then, Cocoon's governmental body ruthlessly "purges" anyone who comes into contact with Pulse. A former soldier, Lightning, is forced to go on the lam after her sister is branded a Pulse l'Cie, servants of the godlike beings called fal'Cie of the planet below, and nabbed by the government. This game is notable for its highly linear prologue segment, leading up to a small Wide-Open Sandbox.
    -   Released on: PS3, 360 (XBO via backward compatibility), PC and mobile (JP).
-   _Final Fantasy XIV_ (2010/2013): Another MMORPG, this time set in the region of Eorzea, which faces threats from an ongoing war with the ruthless and technologically advanced military state Garlemald and its Tin Tyrant generals, while also dealing with the beast tribes and their Primals, as well as the enigmatic Ascians.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIV_ (2010) was released to less than stellar reception. The planned PS3 version was delayed indefinitely and the monthly fee was suspended up until the game was shut down in 2012 so Square Enix could completely revamp it. Only released on PC.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn_ (2013) is the completely overhauled 2.0 version released to much more positive reception. Released on: PC, PS3, PS4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S; services for the PS3 version were closed down in 2017; Xbox port set to launch in 2024.
-   _Final Fantasy XV_ (2016): Warrior Prince Noctis Lucis Caelum goes on a road trip with his friends to marry his fiancée and retrieve his kingdom's stolen Power Crystal from invaders to prevent the world from entering a night of eternal darkness. The game is notable for completely abandoning turn-based combat for action RPG gameplay, along with a Western RPG\-style Wide-Open Sandbox. The setting itself, Eos, is also significantly different from predecessors: branding itself as a "fantasy based on reality", _XV_ has the most "realistic" setting of the main series, resembling a mid/late-20th century earth with Physical Gods, limited Magitek, and real-world consumer brands.
    -   Released on: PS4, XBO, PC
-   _Final Fantasy XVI_ (2023): Set in Valisthea, a once-prosperous continent now engulfed in a bloody war, Clive Rosfield, the firstborn son of the Archduke of Rosaria and the First Shield of Rosaria, sets out on a dark and dangerous journey towards revenge against those responsible for the tragic death of his brother, which soon escalates into a crusade to destroy the Mothercrystals that led to Valisthea’s rise, and are now seemingly contributing to its downfall. Notably Darker and Edgier, Bloodier and Gorier, and Hotter and Sexier than the previous main games, the gameplay further deviates from the series norm by mixing the action RPG elements with Hack and Slash combat in the vein of _Devil May Cry_.
    -   Released on: PS5, PC<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

    -   _Final Fantasy Tactics_: Two warriors, one a noble, and the other a plebe, follow divergent paths in their quest to free Ivalice from tyranny and corruption.

An Updated Re-release entitled _War of the Lions_ was released for the PSP.
    -   _Final Fantasy Tactics Advance_: In this, the most metafictional _FF_ game yet, an Earth boy named Marche is sucked into a fantasy world based on his classmate's memories of a _Final Fantasy_ game.

It wouldn't be released overseas until later when it received an HD re-release on PS4 and Xbox One.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII-2_: After the events of _XIII_, Cocoon is saved and its residents do their best to eke out a living in the land below, Pulse.

A plot-heavy Mascot Fighter that pits legendary heroes and villains into 3D arena combat with RPG Elements. Also, expect a lot of Continuity Porn and Mythology Gags.
    -   _Dissidia 012 \[duodecim\]: Final Fantasy_: A prequel/remake of _Dissidia: Final Fantasy_. In the 12th Cycle, Lightning and her fellow Warriors of Cosmos lead the charge against the Manikins, mysterious pawns that threaten the existence of both heroes and villains alike. Kain has other ideas.

In a world inhabited by the gods Cosmos and Chaos, the crystal that separates them, the Rhythm, is weakened by a malign force. Champions from both sides are sent to gather Rhythmia and restore power to the Rhythm. _Theatrhythm_ combines a rhythm game with RPG mechanics, allowing players to customize a team of characters comprised of unique Abilities and powers and send them out to battle or explore the world through the rhythm game.
        -   _Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call_: An Updated Re-release of the first game, adding a host of new songs and characters, as well as a competitive Versus Mode where you can fight the AI or another player in head-to-head music battles.

    -   _Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker_ (2021) was the fourth expansion and was released on PC, PS4, and PS5 in 2021. It concluded the game's first story arc, taking the story to the regions of Thavnair, Garlemald, and the Moon, and introduced two new Jobs: Sage and Reaper.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail_ (2024) is the upcoming fifth expansion and will be released on PC, PS4, PS5 and Xbox in summer 2024. Players embark for the "New World", a region of the planet of Hydaelyn not yet visited by Eorzeans. Introduces two new jobs: Viper, and a yet-unrevealed magic DPS class.
-   _Final Fantasy XV_ Universe:
    -   _Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV_: Five-episode mini-anime series detailing the backstories of Noctis's travelling partners and their relationships with the Prince.
    -   _Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV_: Taking place between the opening cutscene and the intro of _Final Fantasy XV_, _Kingsglaive_ is a 3D CGI animated movie that details the exploits of the Kingsglaive, an elite guard of Lucis who draw upon the powers of the crystal, and their (ultimately futile) attempt to protect Insomnia from Niflheim's attack on the Crown City.
    -   _A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV_: 2D sidescrolling Beat 'em Up spinoff included as a bonus in pre-ordered and Day One Edition copies of _Final Fantasy XV_ from certain retailers. Set 30 years before _XV_, _A King's Tale_ tells the (slightly embellished) story of Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII in his youth, done in the style of 16-bit graphics.
    -   _Justice Monsters V_: Depicted in-universe as a wildly popular pinball-esque game, _JustMon_ doubles as a free to play smartphone game that follows the Justice Monsters, a band of heroic monsters from the galaxy Nova, and their quest to defeat the forces of evil. Playable in-game as well, using a stripped down version of the real deal. The smartphone version was No Export for You in Asian regions outside of Japan (although there were rumors saying that the Japanese version is available for download if you know what to look for), and was eventually retired in March 2017, mere months after launching.
    -   _King's Knight: Wrath of the Dark Dragon_: A smartphone sequel to _King's Knight_, an obscure top-down scrolling "formation RPG" shooter released by Squaresoft in 1986. Much like the original, you take control of the warrior Ray Jack, the mystic Kaliva, the monster Barusa, and the thief Toby, as they battle for the kingdom. _King's Knight_ also exists in the _XV_ universe as a popular smartphone game that Noctis and pals play to kill time.
    -   _Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV_: A PSVR fishing game in which the player goes on a fishing trip with Noctis and his companions.
    -   _Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition_: A retelling of the original _Final Fantasy XV_ for portable, and targeting casual gamers. This version of the game basically divides the game down into chapters, provides simplified controls, and gives the characters _chibi-style_ designs. It's developed for iOS and Android, though was eventually brought over to consoles as _Pocket Edition HD_.
    -   _Final Fantasty XV: Dawn of the Future_: A novel chronicling the story of What Would Have Been the game’s last three DLC episodes before they were cancelled, serving as the Grand Finale to the overall story.

    Sub-Series 

Games that are not directly connected to the settings or characters of the Main Series, but are still considered _Final Fantasy_ titles.

-   _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles_
    -   _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles_: An Adventurer Is You, traveling the world in order to gather myrrh droplets to recharge your village's Power Crystal, which protects it from the poison gas that covers the world. While the art design returns to a very "cute" style, expect many Player Punches as you witness and participate in the tragic stories of people you meet along the way.
    -   _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates_: A prequel to the first game that tells the story of two twins, Yuri and Chelinka, as they are pursued by an evil church that wants to exploit their unique powers.
    -   _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time_: A spiritual successor to _Ring of Fates_, once again featuring a customizable hero. In a time where the only Crystal left in the world is the one in your village, a simple errand to fetch some medicine by doing a favor for the local scholar turns your entire life upside-down when all the townspeople vanish without a trace... and that's just the start. Happy sixteenth birthday!
    -   _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King_: A spinoff set in the same world, in which the player becomes the king of a castle abandoned by his father and large, empty plots of land. The crystal in the castle grants him the power of Architek, magic that allows him to create buildings. Your job (should you choose to accept it) is to repopulate the city and hire townspeople to become soldiers and uncover dungeons in order to find clues to your father's whereabouts, though the young king is incapable of fighting on his own.
    -   _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord_: Another spinoff, related to _My Life as a King_. While the first game had the player building towns, _Darklord_ is more of a Tower Defense game, involving a new young Darklord named Mira, the daughter of the Big Bad from _King_. As the newest villain in town, adventurers from all around the world come forth to try and defeat her and claim the crystal at the top of her tower, so gameplay involves recruiting monsters and gaining powerful artifacts to defend it from wave after wave of heroes.
    -   _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers_: Set some time after the other games, starring a mercenary named Layle, who is one of the last people in the world able to wield magic thanks to the crystal shard embedded in his cheek. When he meets a Yuke - long thought to be extinct - that appears from a portal, it puts into motion a series of events that threaten to shake the hold of the Lilty-dominated Magitek empire.
-   _Final Fantasy Mystic Quest_: An early spinoff of the series, designed to accustom Western audiences to the JRPG genre. It tells a simple yarn about a young boy named Benjamin who sets out to avenge his hometown, recover the four crystals, and overthrow the Dark King. Doomed to obscurity thanks to its childish difficulty, it also boasted one of the best and most-underrated soundtracks on the platform.
-   _Final Fantasy Adventure_: Instead of the usual creators, it was developed by the same team who made _Final Fantasy Legend III_ as a sort of entry-level JRPG. This entry became the first of the _World of Mana_ series and as such, the story, action-based combat, and stat-leveling system diverge quite a lot from _FF_ titles.
-   _Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light_: In a world threatened by darkness, the Crystals once again select four youths to bestow job classes on in hopes that they can save the world. Unfortunately, the ones they pick are insecure, haughty, and/or self-centered and split the party as soon as they defeat the first boss. Try not to break anything.
-   _Final Fantasy Brigade_
-   _Final Fantasy Dimensions_: Eight youths found themselves separated when the Crystal split the world in two. Now, as the Warriors of Light and the Warriors of Darkness, they travel the separated worlds to find the crystals and fight against The Empire, helping people and gaining allies on the way. A throwback to old-school Final Fantasies, it features a Job System similar to _V_ and contains a ton of Mythology Gags.
-   _Final Fantasy Dimensions II_: Sequel to the above, but in a different world. The game follows a young man named Morrow who desires to become a famous adventurer. His life is forever changed when a meteorite falls near his home of Navos Village and meets a mysterious girl named Aemo. What lies ahead is an adventure that takes Morrow and his companions through time and space in order to save the world from beings attacking the fabric of history. Similar to the first game, it is a cell phone series, but it evokes nostalgia for another Square game, _Chrono Trigger_.
-   _Final Fantasy All the Bravest_: A game for mobile devices. Known mainly for its infamously ridiculous monetization, where everything, including bonus characters and rapid revival, requires you to spend more money.
-   _Pictologica Final Fantasy_: Another game for mobile devices. Final Fantasy meets Picross in a nutshell, and even co-developed by Jupiter Co. Unlocalized as of yet, though you can still download and play regardless of region. Just be prepared to overcome the language barrier and look up (and google translate) the Japanese wiki.
-   _Final Fantasy Record Keeper_: Another game for mobile devices, developed by DeNA and released globally for free in April 2015. Notably better gameplay and less reliance on microtransactions than _All the Bravest_, but best known for its nostalgia-filled trip into all the _Final Fantasy_ games (even featuring some characters from surprising ones, like _Dimensions II_ and _Kingdom Hearts_). As a "Keeper" of records of histories of heroes, the player, Tyro, plunges into various worlds reliving (scaled-down, but still featuring some old gameplay gimmicks) battles and retold plot events while recruiting all sorts of characters from the games (starting with Cloud from _Final Fantasy VII_, all the way to _Sephiroth_ from the same game and Josef from II) with a variety of abilities and equipment.
-   _Final Fantasy Brave Exvius_: Another game for mobile devices. _Brave Frontier_, but with Final Fantasy characters. Unlike _Record Keeper_, which is primarily "_Final Fantasy_ Nostalgia: The Video Game", _Brave Exvius_ features an original story with original characters.
    -   _War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius_: A mobile game prequel of _Brave Exvius_, chronicling the events of the titular war waged on the continent of Ardora in the distant past. This time, it's _Alchemist Code_, but with Final Fantasy characters.
-   _Mobius Final Fantasy_: Yet another game for mobile devices. A miasma is sweeping the world. The wind stops, the sea is wild, the earth begins to rot, and fire's been acting pretty sketchy, too. The world needs a savior, so a bunch of men with amnesia are summoned to follow a ridiculously vague prophecy in hopes that one of them _might_ become the Warrior of Light. Yes, it's based on _Final Fantasy_. The closest the franchise has to a main title on mobile, featuring full 3D CGI graphics and voice-acted cutscenes, backed by several veterans behind the main series.
-   _Knights of the Crystals_: A social game developed by GREE and released in 2010. Closed its doors in 2012.
-   _Final Fantasy Explorers_: A _Monster Hunter_ style Action RPG for the 3DS where the player and three friends can explore the island of Amostela, fighting monsters and seeking crystals.
    -   _Final Fantasy Explorers FORCE_: The mobile game spinoff of _Explorers_, which focuses on the exploits of the warriors of FORCE, an elite team of former Explorers who hunt summoned monsters to protect the world order. Lack of interest killed the game in early 2019.
-   _World of Final Fantasy_: A Mons game for the PS4 and the Vita. Received an Updated Re-release as _World of Final Fantasy Maxima_ for PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The story follows a set of twins named Lann and Reynn, known as Mirage Keepers, who journey through the realm of Grymoire (an amalgamation of many _Final Fantasy_ worlds with characters throughout the series popping up) in an attempt to capture and tame Mirages. The Mirages, or monsters, were once under their control some time back, but an event that transpired (that they don't remember) resulted in them losing their former status as Keepers. Known for its Lighter and Softer world, storyline, and Incredibly Lame Puns abound.

    Related Series 

-   _SaGa_: The first three games were released with the title _Final Fantasy Legend_ in the US. The series is helmed by Akitoshi Kawazu, who also contributed writing and game design work to the first two mainline _Final Fantasy_ installments. As the first two _SaGa_ titles share a major developer and several gameplay elements with _Final Fantasy II_, they—and, by extension, the _SaGa_ franchise as a whole—could be considered Spiritual Successors to that game.
-   _World of Mana_: The first game was part of the _Final Fantasy_ IP with the name _Final Fantasy Adventure_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , but its sequels divorced themselves from the _FF_ brand.
-   _Tactics Ogre_: Though officially part of the _Ogre Battle_ series of games, _Tactics Ogre_ is considered a spiritual predecessor to _Final Fantasy Tactics_, and has a similar gameplay and tone with several members of the production team who worked on both projects. Some elements from the game, such as the Palace of the Dead and the Necromancer Nybeth Obdilord made it into _Final Fantasy XIV_.
-   _Super Mario_: Both of these juggernaut gaming franchises have crossed over with each other on occasion:
    -   _Super Mario RPG_: Mario's very first RPG, which was developed in partnership between Square and Nintendo. In this game, _Final Fantasy_ is represented by Culex, an optional boss that Mario and his companions can fight. While Culex himself isn't from a particular game in the series, he's joined in battle by the four crystals of the elements. His battle music is a remix of the boss battle theme from _IV_, and defeating him plays the series' iconic victory theme. In the remake, the series is indirectly referenced under the title “Last Illusion.”
    -   _Mario Hoops 3-on-3_: A sports spinoff on the Nintendo DS in which _Mario_ and _Final Fantasy_ characters crossover through playing basketball. A Black Mage, a White Mage, a Ninja, a Moogle, and a Cactuar appear as playable characters, while the series is represented through three stages (Rainbow Ship, Glare Desert, and Malboro Garden). It also marks the first _Final Fantasy_\-related game worked on by composer Masayoshi Soken, who would go onto become the main composer for _XIV_ and _XVI_.
    -   _Mario Sports Mix_: A collection of sports games developed by Square Enix and Nintendo. A Black Mage, a White Mage, a Ninja, a Moogle, and a Cactuar appear as playable characters. Behemoth also appears as a boss in the game's story mode.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_: An Action RPG series jointly produced by Square and Disney featuring the latter’s properties alongside a slew of Original Generation characters, with several characters from the _Final Fantasy_ series making guest appearances.
-   _Monster Hunter_: _Final Fantasy_ has crossed over with _Monster Hunter_ on a couple of occassions:
    -   _Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate_: This Nintendo 3DS game featured a collaboration with Square Enix in which hunters received armor sets inspired by Diabolos and Bahamut, while the Palico received an armor set inspired by the Warrior of Light. The Wing of Judgment weapon also has Sephiroth's face positioned on its shaft.
    -   _Monster Hunter: World_: The first multiplatform installment in the series (PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One) had a collaboration with _Final Fantasy XIV_, in which players were given Dragoon armor sets, could confront Behemoth and Cactuars as monsters, and Palicos received equipment that made them look like Moogles.
-   _Lost Odyssey_: An Xbox 360\-exclusive JRPG, it was worked on by Mistwalker, the game development studio Hironobu Sakaguchi created after leaving Squaresoft, who wrote and produced the game alongside Nobuo Uematsu composing its score, with the game itself playing much like the older _Final Fantasy_ games.
-   _The Last Story_: A Wii-exclusive JRPG, this is another Mistwalker game that this time had Sakaguchi in the director's chair, and also featured Uematsu's compositions and music for its score.
-   _Bravely Default_: Began development as a sequel to _4 Heroes of Light_ and uses tons of elements from the franchise and is, for all intents and purposes, a _Final Fantasy_ game.
    -   _Bravely Second_: The sequel to the above.
    -   _Bravely Default II_: The third entry in the _Bravely Default_ series. Much like _Final Fantasy_ itself, it is distinguished by being a numbered sequel and takes place in a new setting with new characters unrelated to the previous games.
-   _Fortune Street_: A _Monopoly_\-esque video game published by Square Enix. Some installments of this series are crossovers between _Final Fantasy_ and _Dragon Quest_.
-   _Octopath Traveler_: Another JRPG from the _Bravely_ team that shares much of _Bravely_'s art style and mechanics, meaning it carries much of _Final Fantasy_'s DNA as well.
    -   _Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent_: A mobile spinoff and prequel to the original _Octopath Traveler_.
    -   _Octopath Traveler II_: As with _Final Fantasy_ and _Bravely Default_, the numbered sequel is set in a different world than the original.
-   _Super Smash Bros._: Nintendo's Massive Multiplayer Crossover Platform Fighter series, mainly focusing their big franchises with some third party Guest Fighters. _Final Fantasy VII_'s Cloud appears in the fourth game as Downloadable Content (along with a stage based on Midgar), and later returns in _Ultimate_ as part of the game at launch. Sephiroth would later join the fray as a DLC character in December 2020, making the _Final Fantasy_ series the first third-party franchise to have two unique characters.
-   _Xenogears_: An RPG developed by Square, which saw release in 1998. This game was originally proposed as a _Final Fantasy_ game, but it was deemed "too dark" to be one, so it became its own thing. XG, an optional boss in _World of Final Fantasy_, hails from this game. Some of its cast also appear in _Brave Exvius_. Its developers ended up leaving Square Enix soon after to form Monolith Soft, and produced two spiritual successors:
    -   _Xenosaga_: The first spiritual successor to _Xenogears_, it was created under Bandai Namco Entertainment's ownership after the crew of _Xenogears_ left Square Enix due to their prioritization of the _Final Fantasy_ brand - namely, investing lots of money into _Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within_. Unfortunately, it was axed after three games and two spinoffs in 2006, leading to:
    -   _Xenoblade Chronicles_: The second spiritual successor to _Xenogears_, it was created under Nintendo's ownership after Monolith Soft was sold to them outright by Bandai Namco in 2007. Tetsuya Nomura, known for designing characters across the _Final Fantasy_ series and creating the aforementioned _Kingdom Hearts_ games, did character design work on _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_ for the group Torna (two of whom would also appear in flashbacks during _Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed_), with other _Final Fantasy_ artists also designing several Rare Blades.
-   _Everybody's Golf_: Perhaps the series' oddest crossover yet, the PS4 version of _Everybody's Golf_ celebrated the 30th anniversary of _Final Fantasy_ with a tournament that awarded various _FF_ themed items. You could even replace your golf cart with a Chocobo!
-   _Tekken 7_: The seventh mainline installment in Bandai Namco's longrunning _Tekken_ series, Noctis Lucis Caelum from _Final Fantasy XV_ appears as a Guest Fighter in the game's first season of DLC, alongside a stage based off of Hammerhead and several music tracks from _XV_.
-   _Dungeon Encounters_: A 2021 RPG directed by _Final Fantasy_ veteran Hiroyuki Ito. The game uses the Active Time Battle system from the older _Final Fantasy_ games and has loose aesthetic and mechanical similarities to the series, distilled into a much more concentrated form.
-   _Triangle Strategy_: Yet another game by the _Bravely Default_ and _Octopath Traveller_ developers, this 2D-HD game is instead a Spiritual Successor to _Final Fantasy Tactics_.
-   _Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring_: A 3D Fighting Game that released for arcades and the PlayStation. Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, and few other characters from _VII_ make guest appereances as playable fighters.

The series has various subpages, including one on game breakers and accidentally humorous overwrought moments.
