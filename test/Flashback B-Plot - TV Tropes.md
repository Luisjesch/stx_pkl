The story of a character in the present day is interspersed with flashbacks telling a linear story of past events of the same character's life, as a form of Backstory. The flashbacks may be prompted by various related objects or situations in the present. This can be done with multiple characters as well, with each flashback focusing on their experience in the same time period, or with each flashback being connected by a similar theme.

Two flashbacks to the same subject matter throughout an episode can be considered the downplayed version of this trope. Unlike frame stories, this trope does not involve anyone narrating the story In-Universe. Compare San Dimas Time, where due to Time Travel, two plotlines in two different times occur "simultaneously". Subtrope to Anachronic Order, Meanwhile, in the Future…, Two Lines, No Waiting, and often Flashback Echo. Can be considered a variation of How We Got Here. Transitions may involve Age Cut. Inverted when the B-plot is Flash Forwards instead of flashbacks. See also Simultaneous Arcs and Whole Episode Flashback.

-   _Spanning Time_ explores the world of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness/Sky through the eyes of Grovyle.

    Film — Animated 

-   In _Finding Dory_, at the same time that Dory, Marlin, and Nemo are traveling in search of Dory's parents, the audience learns through flashbacks about Dory's old life with her parents at the Marine Life Institute, how she ended up accidentally getting herself separated from them, and how she spent her life wandering in the ocean before finally meeting up with Marlin for the very first time during the original _Finding Nemo_ movie.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _3 Idiots_ focuses on the eponymous three idiots in the past and the future (separated by a five-year gap), but it's really more about the characters' lives as college students in the past, with occasional cuts to the future. Case in point, all of the film's musical numbers happen in the past.
-   _Arrival_ (and the story it's based on, "Story of Your Life" by Ted Chiang) alternates between Louise's memories of her daughter and the present day story of translating the alien language, though the flashbacks aren't specifically chronologically ordered.

-   _The Duel of the Brothers_: More often than not, Ho-tian and Jiao-hao will have flashbacks to their pasts when they are kids, promising to look out for each other, before the scene cuts back to the present where they were adults. Notably the last scene of the two brothers together: Ho-tian holding on Jia-hao's corpse and telling him not to die, while intersect with a Match Cut depicting a flashback of Ho-tian (as a child) holding a feverish, seriously ill Jia-hao (ditto) telling his younger brother to wake up.

-   _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_: After Rocket is left in critical condition in the film's opening, the A-plot of the first two acts is the Guardians trying to save his life while the B-plot is Rocket's Adventures in Comaland while he relives his past.
-   _Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again_ is about Sophie's attempt to prepare the grand reopening of her late mother Donna's hotel when everything seems to be going wrong. Her stuggles remind Donna's friends Rosie and Tanya about the struggles Donna had when she first got to the island, so the story about Sophie is interspersed with flashbacks following younger Donna after she graduated with her friends, when she traveled around Europe, and when she met Sophie's three fathers.
-   The main story of _Memento_ sees Leonard interacting with people around town, while the secondary story consists of shorter black and white scenes of him in his room mostly talking about his memory condition, either on the phone with someone or to himself in Second-Person Narration. The two stories converge at the end, making the movie one story told from both beginning and end.
-   In _Memorial Day_, WWII veteran Bud Vogel's war experiences are told through a series of flashbacks while he explains his them to his grandson Kyle, while the film also flashes forward to an adult Kyle developing his own war experiences similar to Bud's.
-   _Sunstroke_: The film plays out in two narrative tracks. In the first one the protagonist, a nameless lieutenant, is stuck in a prisoner-of-war pen in 1920, because he fought on the losing side in the Russian Civil War. This is intercut with a series of flashbacks to a much happier time for the lieutenant, back in 1907 when he took a luxury cruise down the Volga River and made love with a beautiful woman.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Arrowverse_:
    -   The first five seasons of _Arrow_ alternate between the present day and the five years that Oliver Queen spent on the island of Lian Yu (but also Hong Kong and Russia, unknown to everyone else) that turned him into the vigilante we see at the start of the series.
        -   The episode "Odyssey" put most of its emphasis on events on the island.
        -   The episode "The Undertaking" didn't use the island at all but did focus on events surrounding the sinking of the Queen's Gambit and Moira's involvement with Tempest.
        -   "The Promise", like "Odyssey" focuses more on the island than on the present.
        -   Inverted in Seasons 7 and 8, which alternates between the present and Flash Forwards to the future, which follow the children of the members of Team Arrow.

        -   "Tricksters" shows what really happened with the Reverse-Flash and Harrison Wells after the former killed Barry's mother.
        -   "The Trap" is somewhat of a Sequel Episode to "Things You Can't Outrun", in that it uses a similar format to show the time when Barry was in a coma (which was right after the accelerator explosion). A deleted scene would have added another flashback to the episode, from Caitlin's point of view.
        -   "Therefore I Am" shows us us Clifford DeVoe's origins on the night of the accelerator explosion and the aftermath.
        -   "O Come All Ye Thankful" gives us Cicada's origin story in a similar manner, showing us his relationship with his niece and how he received powers from a satellite from the Enlightenment, which also injured his niece.

-   _Criminal Minds_: The series' present-day stories about detectives solving crimes are intertwined with flashbacks detailing the crime itself and the people involved.
-   In _Forever Knight_ every episode has flashbacks to something in the Vampire Detective's past that's related—directly or thematically—to the case he's investigating.
-   The _Firefly_ episode "Out of Gas" begins with Mal collapsing to the floor of the dark and deserted _Serenity_. As he struggles to treat his injuries and repair the ship, flashbacks alternate between the immediate lead-up to this event and the backstory of how Mal first purchased the _Serenity_ and assembled his trusty crew.
-   _Forever_ has this in pretty much every episode, since Henry has been around for over two hundred years and every current situation reminds him of _something_ in his past. A few flashbacks are only long enough to provide insight into characters rather than fully-fledged B-plots. One flashback from Adam's point of view shows the horrific treatment he received from Dr. Josef Mengele but doesn't actually have a plot, only relevance to the current-day situation.
-   In the first two seasons of _The Good Place_, the A-story would show what was happening to the characters in the afterlife, while the B-story would use flashbacks to show what the characters were like while they were still alive.
-   _The Haunting of Hill House (2018)_: Each episode in the first season follows the Crain siblings in the present time, but the B-plot of almost all episodes are flashbacks of their time as children in the eponymous haunted house, and are slowly telling the events that led to their mother's mysterious death.
-   _Highlander: The Series_ made a habit of this. Almost every episode featured flashbacks to earlier times in Duncan's life.

-   One season 1 episode of _House of Anubis_ focuses on the students seeking treasure and having their usual drama, but involves a subplot about Victor and Sarah remembering moments from their childhood, told through flashbacks, in order to give more context about their complex relationship and Victor's quest for eternal life.
-   _Lost_: Most episodes have flashbacks as the B-story, focusing on a single character's life before they ended up on the island, usually thematically connected to the A-story. In later seasons, the flashbacks are sometimes replaced with flashforwards, showing future events, and flash-sideways, which depict the characters in an alternate reality.
-   _Monk_: The episode "Mr. Monk And Little Monk" has an A-plot where Monk is hired by a childhood friend to investigate a murder, triggering flashbacks to Monk's childhood where he had to help the same friend who's been framed for stealing bake sale money.
-   _Once Upon a Time_: In season 1, the A-story of each episode focuses on life in the town of Storybrooke, while the B-story takes place in flashback showing life before the curse in Fairy Tale land. The flashbacks and the A-story focus on the same character, showing what their lives were like before and after the curse.
-   The series finale of _Parks and Recreation_ has a main plot where the characters, many of whom are going to leave Pawnee, take one last job to fix a broken swing set. As each character takes a role in this job, they get a lengthy flash-forward sequence showing what their lives will be in the future.
-   In the mini-series _The Prisoner (2009)_, the protagonist resigns from his job working for an intelligence organisation in New York, and shortly afterward finds himself trapped in a mysterious and isolated Village. As the A-plot follows his investigation of the Village, occasional scenes show his actions back in New York immediately following his resignation, apparently leading up to showing how he ended up in the Village at the beginning of the series. It turns out that, due to the supernatural nature of the Village, the protagonist is simultaneously in the Village _and_ still in New York, and the scenes in New York aren't flashbacks, but are happening at the same time as the other events of the series.
-   The first two seasons of _Quantico_ jump back and forth between Alex's time at the eponymous academy (or, in the second season, her time at The Farm), and the present.

-   _Yellowjackets_ is split between following when the cast were in a plane crash as teenagers and had to survive in the wilderness by themselves, and their current lives 25 years later.

    Theatre 

-   _Darwin Young_ is about a teenager whose friend asks him to help investigate the unsolved murder of her uncle, 30 years earlier.

    -   "The Old Sugarman Place" follows two stories taking place at the eponymous Michigan home. The A-plot has BoJack, having impulsively fled Los Angeles, spend a year fixing up the abandoned house with help from his new neighbor.

-   _Pepper Ann_: The final episode, "The Finale", takes place in the future, with the B-plot taking place 15 years prior in the in-series present.
-   Over the course of _Transformers: Animated_, each Autobot on the Spacebridge crew gets one or two episodes focused on their past and how they came to be on the team.
-   _We Bare Bears_: In "Occupy Bears", the cave is in danger of being destroyed to make room for a cell phone tower. While the bears try to find a way to save their home in the present, flashbacks to their original search for a home are prompted by various objects in their home in the present.
