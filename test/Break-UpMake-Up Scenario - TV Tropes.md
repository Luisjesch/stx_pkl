_"We fight, we break up  
We kiss, we make up"_

The heroes share an incredible adventure that helps them develop strong feelings, as friends, lovers, or family. Then, there is a breaking point, a moment where they split. It may be an argument, a misunderstanding, a choice one of them makes... whatever the reason, their relation seems to be broken forever.

But we all know what’s going to happen next, don’t we?

Yes, they meet again, make up, reconcile, apologise and forgive, and forget about everything. The point of a Break-Up/Make-Up is to test the strength of the heroes' feelings, and to make the audience wonder whether they’ll come back together and have a Happy Ending.

Here's the classic story:

1.  About three quarters of the way through the story, the couple leave each other after a dramatic scene (usually an argument).
2.  They spend some time away from each other, even though they miss the other’s company.
3.  Some event or simply fate brings them back together, and they reconcile, admit their feelings, and share a happy end.

This scenario is used so often in fiction that it would be easy to expect it whenever a story focuses on the relation of the couple. Over the years, it went from a major plot twist to a convention, to the point where most of the audience will generally expect it.

This trope applies not only to love stories (in which case it ends on a Last-Minute Hookup), but also to buddy movies. One of the main issues is that, since the breakup usually happens some time before the end, the time the heroes spend apart is therefore very short, and the makeup is quick to come. In long-running series, this can be avoided by making the split last several episodes, to let you wonder if the characters stay apart. Most of the time, however, it is used for one episode only. In this case, it is a Feud Episode, which centers around a Break-Up/Make-Up. This trope is very common in Soap Opera.

Compare Will They or Won't They? when the audience is left in doubt on whether a couple will form or not. Contrast No Romantic Resolution. The Second-Act Breakup is this trope applied to a movie or a play. When this keeps happening, you have a Relationship Revolving Door. Sister trope to Split and Reunion, when a Split Personality gets separated but reunites stronger than ever. Plot-Mandated Friendship Failure is this trope's platonic counterpart.

-   _How I Met Your Mother_:
    -   Lily left Marshall for months to stabilize her life, and it took them time to go back together.
    -   Ted, Robin, and Barney go through this several times, whether together or with their respective lovers (when the break up isn't permanent). In "Last Forever, Part 2", Robin finally returns to the group for Ted and The Mother's wedding. The fact that she has her dogs again implies she is done with her globe-trotting. There is no mention of her being a bullfighter.
-   _Liv and Maddie_: In Season 2 after Diggie returns from Tundrabania and soon announces he wants to leave to be a foreign exchange student again in Australia, this causes Maddie to get into a fight over missing him so much and leaving again that they eventually break up. He returns home one season later, and they make up and get back together.
-   _My Wife and Kids_
-   _Lost_: Charlie and Claire.
-   In _The Big Bang Theory_, Bernadette almost called off the wedding after discovering Howard’s past, but they came back together when he proved through a speech how much he loves her and how much he changed thanks to her.

-   _Breaking Bad_, with Walt and Jessie, also Walt and Skyler. The first time, that is...
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: In the sixth season, Willow and Tara end up broken up for much of the season, and reconcile just before the series finale. And then Tara is shot and killed by accident.
-   _Doctor Who_ does this in "Asylum of the Daleks"; the story starts with Amy and Rory signing divorce papers and getting kidnapped by the Daleks before Rory could file the papers, finalizing the split. During the episode, Amy admits to Rory that she only instigated their break-up in an ill-advised case of I Want My Beloved to Be Happy (she was incapable of having the children she knew he wanted, and chose to leave him so he could find someone who could make him a father). By the end of the episode, Amy and Rory were together again, the divorce quietly forgotten.
    -   The scenario that plays out over the Series 8 episodes "Kill the Moon" and "Mummy on the Orient Express" follow the trope almost to a T. Clara breaks off her friendship with the Doctor in the former because he places her in an impossible situation; in the next episode, she's agreed to go on one final adventure with him. By the end of the episode, she's recommitted to travelling with him — not that she tells her boyfriend Danny about her change of mind.

-   The first season of _Bewitched_ featured this trope several times. The source of Darrin and Samantha's fights were usually Darrin's Fantastic Racism toward witches and demands for Sam to be "normal," or Sam's many relatives scheming to break the two up. It was most apparent in "I'd Rather Twitch Than Fight"—Samantha comes up with some extremely catchy slogans for Darrin's latest advertising campaign, and he accuses her of using magic to do it because there's no way a _housewife_ could have devised them on her own (yes, _Bewitched_ is heavy on Values Dissonance). These episodes would often result in the two having a fight or, in extreme cases, Samantha leaving Darrin to go home to her mother's. But love always prevailed, and the two would reunite by the time the credits rolled.
-   Played with on _The Golden Girls_ regarding Dorothy and Stan. The two had _already_ broken up at the start of the show by divorcing after thirty-eight years of marriage; the split was brought on by Stan's philandering. However, multiple episodes hinted that both of them still had feelings for each other, and about once a season the two would consider reconciling. In some cases, they actually start dating again, and even almost remarried in Season Six. They ultimately never reunite, but they _do_ make up with one another; Dorothy notes that their therapist's advice, to never interact again, is foolish because they share children, grandchildren, and many happy memories. In the finale they admit that the love will always be there, even though Dorothy has found love with another man.
-   In the _Getting Together_ episode "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do," the protagonists get a rejection letter that praises Bobby's music but criticizes Lionel's lyrics. Lionel thinks Bobby would be better off without him, so he ends their partnership. They get back together after Bobby's partnership with famed songwriter Jackie Michel ends due to Michel being The Prima Donna.

The two keep things civil for most of Chapter 1, but Tara ends up avoiding Madison early on in Chapter 2, just as Madison wants to actually participate in the investigation. Much later on in the game, after Madison has come Back from the Dead, Madison and Tara apologize to each other and reconcile. Their dispute is ultimately resolved in the good ending; Madison decides to quit _Taranormal_ after all, but offers to train Morgan to be her replacement and make guest appearances from time to time.
