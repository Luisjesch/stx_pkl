A Gender-Equal Ensemble is an ensemble, team, band, family, or another group of main characters, consisting of at least four members, that has the exact same number of one gender as it does any other. This is normally done either for reasons of advancing gender equality, attempting to appeal equally to both male and female demographics, or for reasons of balance and symmetry.

In a Family Tropes, this will often take the form of having a father, a mother, a son, and a daughter, so that each standard role in a Nuclear Family has a representative. If the characters are not related to each other, it can sometimes make it easier for each character to have a potential love interest.

Compare Two Guys and a Girl, Two Girls and a Guy, Two Girls to a Team (when combined with a Four-Temperament Ensemble), Four-Girl Ensemble, and Masculine, Feminine, Androgyne Trio (an androgynous character rounds out the gender ratio in an odd-numbered group). Contrast with The Smurfette Principle, The One Guy, Chromosome Casting, Affirmative Action Girl, and Improbably Female Cast.

-   The initial team roster in _Detective Comics (Rebirth)_ has three males (Batman, Red Robin, Clayface) and three females (Batwoman, Spoiler, Orphan).
-   _Doom Patrol_: in Grant Morrison's arc, we have an odd variation of this trope; the core of the group is formed by Cliff Steele, Crazy Jane and Rebis, a hermaphrodite derived by the fusion of the pilot Larry Trainor, the scientist Eleanor Poole and the mysterious Negative Spirit.
-   The Fantastic Four during the time after the first Secret War when the Thing stayed behind on Battleworld: Mr. Fantastic, the Human Torch, the Invisible Woman, and the She-Hulk.
    -   In the Marvel Mangaverse, the Human Torch is female making the team fit this trope.

-   The Sonic the Hedgehog (IDW) series started with a gender unequal cast due to the source material, but has been introducing original male and female major characters with alternating appearances and remaining more or less equal. As of the end of its fifth year, with the exception of the villainous Surge and Kit, all female characters have been heroes, and all male characters have been villains. These characters are:
    -   Female: Tangle the Lemur, Jewel the Beetle, Whisper the Wolf, Belle the Tinkerer (robot lion), Lanolin the Sheep, and Surge the Tenrec
    -   Male: Doctor Starline (platypus), Rough and Tumble the Skunk Brothers, Mimic the Octopus, Clutch the Opossom, and Kit the Fennec.
-   In the 1980s, quite a few of the X-Men and spin-off teams written by Chris Claremont were either this or, if the team had an odd number of members, would have a slight female majority. Examples would e. g. be the X-Men team shortly after Cyclops' wedding (Storm, Shadowcat, Rogue and Rachel Summers, Wolverine, Colossus and Nightcrawler, supplemented by either guest-star Cyclops or Professor X). Around the same time the New Mutants consisted of four girls (Dani Moonstar, Wolfsbane, Magik and Magma), three boys (Cannonball, Sunspot, and Cypher) and an asexually reproducing alien generally referred to in the masculine (Warlock); the team was jointly led by Dani Moonstar and Cannonball.

-   _Between Minds_, a _Half-Life_/_Portal_ fanfic, seems to be going toward a main group of two girls (Alyx and Sam) and two guys (Barney and Marcus). The next chapter is stated to have Gordon and Chell, who will likely be another balanced group.
-   _BlazBlue Alternative: Remnant_: Teams RNJR and JSMN are both comprised of two men (Ragna and Jaune Arc for RNJR, Jin Kisaragi and Kagura Mutsuki for JSMN) and two women (Ruby Rose and Noel Vermillion for RNJR, Mai Natsume and Ciel Soliel for JSMN).
-   _Christian Weston Chandler in Survivor: Kujira-Jima_ zigzags this. There are ten players of each gender, but only one of the three tribes is split evenly due to two women not being assigned to one at the start of the game.
-   _Infinity Train: Blossoming Trail_, the Red Lotus Quarto has two females (Chloe and Amelia) and two males (Atticus and Lexi) with the latter two also denizens. In _Infinity Train: Voyage of Wisteria_, with Chloe and Atticus gone, it stays the same with Hazel and Goh replacing them.
-   The _Total Drama_ fic _Total Drama Avengeance: Old Losers vs New Losers_ invokes this with the starting cast, which consists of eleven males and eleven females. The main reason Chris chose Beth and Bridgette to compete despite Beth being a former finalist and Bridgette competing in the first three seasons despite only making it to the top ten once was to have an equal cast.
-   _True Potential_ focuses on Team 3, which is made up of two guys (Naruto and Shikamaru) and two girls (Hinata and their sensei Anko).
    -   After the Time Skip, there's Team 9, which is also made up of two girls (Hanabi and Katsumi) and two guys (Kanji and their sensei Naruto).

-   _The Incredibles_ has two males (Mr. Incredible and Dash) and two females (Elastigirl and Violet). Technically, Jack-Jack unbalances this but he's not in most of the movie so it counts.

-   _Inside Out_ has six main characters that exist in Riley's mind — Joy, Sadness, and Disgust are female, while Fear, Anger, and Bing Bong are male.

-   In _Wreck-It Ralph_, the group of main heroes consists of a girl (Vanellope), a woman (Sgt. Calhoun), and two men (Ralph and Felix).

    -   _Six Cousin Series_ - Three boys (Jack, Cyril, and Roderick) and three girls (Jane, Susan, and Melisande)
-   _The Berenstain Bears_: For the longest time, The Bear family consisted of Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Brother Bear, and Sister Bear. This balance was undone with the introduction of Honey Bear in 2000.
-   Can't forget the mystery-solving siblings from _The Boxcar Children_. There's Violet and Jessie, and then there's Henry and Benny.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_: All of the books feature this with their main child protagonists except _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_ (which has Two Guys and a Girl).
    -   _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ has two boys (Peter and Edmund) and two girls (Susan and Lucy)
    -   _Prince Caspian_ has the same two boys and two girls, although that one also has Caspian as the protagonist of the B plot, so it blurs the line. (Played straight if you consider "children from England" a separate category.)
    -   _The Silver Chair_ and _The Last Battle_ have one boy and one girl from England, though they're accompanied by various Narnians (human and otherwise) on their missions.
    -   _The Horse and His Boy_ has one male human and one female human and one male horse and one female horse.
    -   All told, there is an equal number of male and female Friends of Narnia, though by _The Last Battle_ Susan's status is in question.
-   The first few of Jim Butcher's _Codex Alera_ books have a gender-equal number of point-of-view characters. They start with Amara and Isana (female) and Tavi and Fidelias (male). The balance is preserved in the third book when Fidelias disappears and is replaced by Ehren but is ultimately upset in the fourth book when Fidelias returns.
-   _Dead City_: The main team consists of two boys (Grayson and Alex) and two girls (Molly and Natalie).
-   Also from Jim Butcher, the _The Dresden Files_ book _Changes_ has the initial group that goes off Storming the Castle at the climax: four men (Harry, Thomas, Sanya, Martin), four women (Murphy, Molly, Susan, Lea), and a dog (Mouse).
-   Societally enforced for families in _The Giver_, since feelings are suppressed and spouses and children assigned by the community leaders. All married couples are one male, one female, and each family is assigned one boy and one girl child (not at the same time, so there will be times for each family when they skew one way or the other, but it ultimately balances out this way).
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Although most of the series stars the central trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, we do get a temporary Gender Equal Ensemble when they're joined by Ginny, Luna, and Neville for the climax of _Order of the Phoenix_.
    -   Also the founders of Hogwarts consisted of two wizards (Gryffindor and Slytherin) and two witches (Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) whilst the modern-day heads of houses are Professors McGonagall and Sprout (female) and Snape and Flitwick (male).
    -   Every year at Hogwarts, four boys and four girls become prefects, a boy and girl from each house. In Harry's year, the prefects are Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, Ernie Macmillan, and Anthony Goldstein (male), and Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, Hannah Abbott, and Padma Patil (female).
-   _The Homework Machine_: The "D-Squad" (named such since their surnames all start with D) consist of Brenton Damagatchi and Sam "Snik" Dawkins (male) and Judy Douglas and Kelsey Donnelly (female).
-   _The Hunger Games_. Each Games starts out with twelve male and twelve female tributes, with the exception of the Fiftieth Games which featured twenty-four males and twenty-four females. Due to the nature of the Games, the gender ratio often shifts as players are eliminated. For example, while the final eight in the Seventy-fourth Games fit this trope, their counterparts from the Seventy-fifth Games consist of five males and three females, though two of the males in the latter are killed shortly after, leaving a gender-equal group of six to be rescued from the arena.
    -   This trope is also in play for the main characters while they are being prepared for the Games. Katniss and Peeta share a male mentor, Haymitch, and a female escort, Effie, and Katniss has a male stylist, Cinna, while Peeta has a female stylist, Portia.
-   The eight travelers on the peach in _James and the Giant Peach_: James, the Grasshopper, the Centipede, and the Earthworm (male), and the Spider, the Ladybug, the Glowworm, and the Silkworm (female).
-   _Max & the Midknights_: The titular Midknights are made up of Max, Millie (girls), Simon, and Kevyn (boys).
-   The _Mediochre Q Seth Series_, if you only count the main four: Mediochre and Joseph are male, Dhampinella and Charlotte are female. If you include fringe members of the group who join them occasionally on adventures, it _still_ sort of works in the first book, because you can interpret Danny as being balanced out by Desra, the female mouse. Otherwise, it tends to fall apart quickly once you start including Rowan, Melz or Queen MAB.
-   _Monster of the Month Club_: The twelve monsters, when brought together. The six from odd-numbered months are all male and the six from even-numbered months are all female.
-   The titular group in _The Mysterious Benedict Society_ consists of two boys (Reynie and Sticky) and two girls (Kate and Constance). Even their adult friends count—Rhonda and Number Two, Mr. Benedict and Milligan.

-   _Warrior Cats_:
    -   The second story arc has three she-cats (Squirrelpaw, Tawnypelt, and Feathertail) traveling with three toms (Brambleclaw, Crowpaw, and Stormfur).
    -   The fourth story arc put two toms (Lionblaze and Jayfeather) and two she-cats (Dovewing and Ivypool) at the forefront of the fight against the Dark Forest. Additionally, virtually all of the chapters are from the point of view of one of these four. The first book of this arc is about several cats setting out on a journey to retrieve the lake's water. The cats chosen for this are four females (Dovepaw, Whitetail, Sedgewhisker, and Petalfur) and four males (Lionblaze, Tigerheart, Toadfoot, and Rippletail).
    -   Supplementary material and the fifth arc reveal that the very first Clan leaders (excluding the forgotten SkyClan) were two females (Shadow and Wind) and two males (Thunder and River).

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._: The Team is initially composed of the male Phil Coulson, Grant Ward, and Leo Fitz, and the female Skye/Daisy Johnson, Melinda May, and Jemma Simmons. It's also distributed so that there is at least one male and one female for both brains (Fitz, Johnson, and Simmons) and brawn (Coulson, Ward, and May). While the team gains and loses members from there, it still mostly manages to stick to this.
-   _A.N.T. Farm_: The show has three girls (Chyna, Olive, and Lexi) and three boys (Fletcher, Cameron, and Angus). Subverted in that Cameron and Angus were never in the main cast at the same time.
-   _Austin & Ally_: Dez and Austin match with Trish and Ally.
-   _Barney & Friends_ usually has two boys and two girls per episode amongst the kid cast, although Baby Bop has always been the sole female dinosaur.

-   _Bella and the Bulldogs_ in its first season had Bella, Sophie, and Pepper on the girls' side and Troy, Sawyer, and Newt on the boys' side. This is thrown off-kilter in the second season when Ace joins the main cast.
-   _The Beverly Hillbillies_: The titular family has two males (Jed and Jethro) and two females (Granny and Elly). Additional regular characters include two males (Milburn and Sonny Drysdale) and two females (Margaret Drysdale and Jane Hathaway).

-   _The Brady Bunch_: Not counting the housekeeper, the titular family consists of one father with three boys and one mother with three daughters.
-   _The Brittas Empire_ becomes this in its last series, having a main cast consisting of 4 females (Carole, Julie, Linda and Helen) and 4 males (the titular Gordon Brittas, Tim, Gavin, and Colin). Beforehand though, the show was a Downplayed example of this, having a slightly dominant female cast of 5 girls and 4 boys.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Zig-zagged due to all the cast changes. Played straight during season 2 and the beginning of season 5 (up until Riley left, at which point the show returned to being predominantly female). Season 4 can also count; while only Buffy and Willow were listed in the main credits, the other four starring roles being male, Anya and Tara appeared in so many episodes and were so closely tied to the core cast of Scoobies that counting them balances things out. For a while in season 9, after Giles' death, it was the core three plus Spike, Andrew, and Dawn.
-   For _Bunk'd_, it changed depending on the season when looking at Grizzly (boys') and Woodchuck (girls') cabins.
    -   First season had Xander, Ravi, and Jorge compared to Lou, Emma, Zuri, and Tiffany.
    -   Second season added Griff to the boys, though he was only a recurring character.

-   The main cast members of the first three seasons of _Castle_ consisted of four men (the titular protagonist, Ryan, Esposito, and Captain Montgomery) and four women (Beckett, Lanie, Alexis, and Martha).
-   _Coupling_: Three boys (Steve, Patrick, and Jeff) and three girls (Sally, Susan, and Jane). This was enough to get it described constantly as the Transatlantic Equivalent of _Friends_, though that's a gross oversimplification.
-   _Criminal Minds_: Comes close to until season 12, when for the first time, there are four guys and four girls in the main cast.
-   _CSI_: Excluding the detectives, the Lab Rats and The Coroner, the main CSIs team are initially made up of three guys (Gil Grissom, Warrick Brown, and Nick Stokes) and two girls (Catherine Willows and Sara Silder). Later, former Lab Rat Greg Sanders got promoted to join the team, the scale skewed to the male side. However, Warrick died, Grissom left the team and got replaced by Ray Langston who didn't stay very long and got replaced by D.B. Russell, and then Catherine got a job offer at the FBI and got replaced by Russell's former co-worker Julie "Finn" Finlay. Then, Conrad Ecklie's daughter, Morgan, joins the team which makes it more gender-equal with three guys (D.B., Nick, and Greg) and three girls (Sara, Finn, and Morgan).
-   _Dawson's Creek_: Played straight throughout the show. The first season has only two boys (Dawson and Pacey) and two girls (Joey and Jen). In season 2 the Mcphee siblings (a boy and a girl) also join the main cast. Andie, the female Mcphee, left the series midway through the fourth season, but she was more or less replaced by Audrey in season 5 and 6.
-   _Doctor Who_: When there are four people in the TARDIS (something that's usually avoided because of how hard it is for the writers to find something for all those characters to _do_) the numbers tend to fall out like this:
    -   First Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Susan
    -   First Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Vicki
    -   Fifth Doctor, Tegan, Nyssa, and Adric
    -   (Briefly) Fifth Doctor, Tegan, Nyssa, and Turlough
    -   Eleventh Doctor, Amy, Rory, and River
    -   Thirteenth Doctor, Graham, Yasmin, and Ryan.
-   _Dog with a Blog_: Avery, Chloe, and Ellen on the female side, and Tyler, Bennett, and Stan on the male side.
-   _For the People_: Jill, Sandra, Allison, Kate, and Tina for women; Roger, Leonard, Seth, Jay, and Judge Byrne for the men. Though it is played with in that the defense side has only one male regular (Jay) and the prosecution side has only one female regular (Kate).
-   _The Fresh Beat Band_'s Marina, Kiki, Twist, and Shout.
-   _Friends_: Three men (Ross, Chandler, and Joey) and three women (Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe). Two-thirds of the group pair off into couples by the end of the series.
-   _Game Shakers_ does so with the child cast, with Babe and Kenzie balancing out with Triple G and Hudson, although it's subverted when Double G is counted and even more off-balanced if his assistants Bunny and Ruthless are as well.
-   _Ghostwriter_: Unless you count Ghostwriter himself (male), there are four founding members of the Ghostwriter Team, two girls and two boys. For the majority of the series, it's three girls and three boys. Casey's addition late in the series upsets the balance, but she's not always with the team.
-   _Girl Meets World_ was this in season 1 by a technicality. Riley, Maya, and Topanga are balanced by Lucas, Cory, and Auggie, since Farkle was not _officially_ part of the main cast in season 1, even though he was never really considered anything less than a lead. This is played more straight with the four main _teen_ characters (Riley/Maya vs. Lucas/Farkle).
-   _Glee_: Though the group's composition is constantly in flux (often as a plot point), the titular Glee club spends most of its time in an even 6/6 split between the boys and girls for season 1 and hovers around that number for most of season 2 as well.
-   _Good Luck Charlie_: Prior to the introduction of Toby midway through the show's third season, the Duncan family consisted of three males (Bob, PJ, and Gabe) and three females (Amy, Teddy, and Charlie).
-   _The Good Place_'s main cast consists of three guys (Michael, Chidi, and Jason) and three girls (Eleanor, Tahani, and Janet). However, Michael and Janet aren't human - Michael is a celestial architect inhabiting the constructed form of a male human, and Janet is a celestial database who presents as female but reminds people consistently that her nature and gender can't be accurately described by terms like "robot" and "girl".
-   _The Haunted Hathaways_: The human Hathaways (Taylor, Frankie, and Michelle) are all female and the ghost Prestons (Miles, Louie, and Ray) are all male.
-   _Happy Endings_: Three boys (Dave, Max, Brad), three girls (Jane, Alex, Penny).
-   _Henry Danger_, like _Game Shakers_ does so with its child cast, with Henry and Jasper complementing Charlotte and Piper, but it is subverted when the adults, Ray and Schwoz, are counted.
-   _Heroes Reborn_: after the previous series has the main cast _mostly_ consisting of men all four seasons, this miniseries has the main cast consisting of five men (Noah Bennet, Tommy Clark, Luke Collins, Quentin Frady, and Carlos Gutierrez) and five women (Joanne Collins, Emily Duval, Malina Bennet, Erica Kravid, and Miko Otomo).
-   _How I Met Your Mother_: Throughout its first eight seasons has had three men (Ted, Marshall, and Barney), and only two women (Robin and Lily). However, as of the ninth and final season, it becomes gender-equal when Cristin Milioti joins the main cast as the _finally revealed mother_.
-   _iCarly_: Sam and Carly are the women, Spencer and Freddie are the men, thrown off-balance when Gibby joins the main cast.
-   In _The InBESTigators_, the eponymous team is made up of two boys (Ezra and Kyle) and two girls (Maudie and Ava).
-   _Jessie_ consists of three girls (Jessie, Emma, and Zuri) and three guys (Ravi, Luke, and Bertram).
-   _Johnson and Friends_: From Season 3 onwards, the main cast consists of three boys (Johnson, Diesel, and Alfred) and three girls (McDuff, Squeaky, and Victoria).
-   _Knight Squad_:
    -   The Phoenix Squad consists of Ciara, Prudence, Warwick, and Arc.
    -   The Kracken Squad also has two males (extras) and two females - Sage and Prudence.
-   _Legend of the Seeker_: In Season 2, Cara joins the group. She is the second woman, with Kahlan. On the male side, there is Richard and Zedd. Even when Richard is temporarily away, they add another man who is the new Seeker.
-   _Legends of Tomorrow_ started out with a predominately male cast (only two of the original nine Legends were women), but by Seasons 4 and 5, the main cast had become evenly split between genders ... most of the time. Occasionally the gender balance would get thrown off, one way or the other, as new characters were added and old characters left.
-   _Liv and Maddie_ has the two title characters and Karen on the female side, and Joey, Parker, and Pete on the male side. Subverted in the final season when Pete is replaced by Ruby.
-   _Magic Mountain_ consists of two males (Dragon and Lion) and two females (Panda and Tortoise):
-   _Merlin_: The four main characters are two boys (Arthur and Merlin) and two girls (Guinevere and Morgana). May not count for some considering the boys dominate most of the screentime, to the point where the girls are sometimes completely absent for certain episodes.
-   _Mimpi Metropolitan_ initially consist of three males (Bambang, Alan, and Prima) and three females (Melani, Pipin, and Mami Bibir). It changes after the male Juna joins the main characters.
-   The _Monster Warriors_ consist of two boys (Luke and Antonio) and two girls (Tabby and Vanka).
-   _My Mad Fat Diary_: The pub gang has 3 girls and 3 boys.
-   _The Nanny_: The Sheffield household has three males (Maxwell and Brighton Sheffield, Niles the butler) and three females (Fran Fine, Maggie, and Gracie Sheffield).
-   Zig-Zagged on _Odd Squad_ due to characters swapping out between seasons:
    -   Season 1 played the trope straight, with two boys (Otto and Oscar) and two girls (Olive and Oprah).
    -   The first few episodes of Season 2 continued playing it straight, with Otto and Olive being replaced by Otis and Olympia. After Oscar was replaced with Oona, however, Otis became The One Guy.
    -   Season 3 went back to playing it straight, with two girls (Opal and Orla) and two boys (Omar and Oswald). Albeit adding Oprah would tip the scale in favor of the girls.
-   _Orphan Black_ is an interesting example, as the main cast in Season 2 is made up of three women (Tatiana Maslany, Maria Doyle Kennedy, and Evelyne Brochu) and three men (Jordan Gavaris, Dylan Bruce, and Kevin Hanchard), but the actual show is predominantly female, as Tatiana Maslany plays five main characters.
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: The six major characters are equally balanced by gender. Three girls: Constance (Connie) Brooks, Margaret Davis and Harriet Conklin. Three boys: Phillip Boynton, Osgood Conklin, and Walter Denton.
-   Though there are seven rangers in _Power Rangers Cosmic Fury_ plus an Honorary True Companion, they never all fight together. For much of the series, there are three girls (Amelia, Izzy, and Fern) and three guys (alternating between Javi, Aiyon, Zayto, Billy, and Olly).
-   _The Puzzle Place_: Three girls (Julie, Kiki, and Jody) and three boys (Ben, Leon, and Skye). Even if you include Sizzle and Nuzzle and the Piece Police, it still counts. They did add a fourth boy (Kyle) near the end of the series, though.
-   _Reservation Dogs_: Following Daniel's death a year prior to the events of the show, the Rez Dogs friend group consists of two boys (Bear and Cheese) and two girls (Elora and Willie Jack).
-   _The Sarah Jane Adventures_: Up until the story "The Nightmare Man" at the beginning of series 4, the team consisted of two boys (Luke and Clyde), and two girls (Maria or Rani, and Sarah Jane).
-   _Saved by the Bell_: Zack, Slater, and Screech complement Kelly, Jessie, and Lisa. The entire main cast is thrown off balance due to Max (in Season 1) & Mr. Belding but is balanced out in the last season with Tori.
-   _Sense8_: The titular sensate cluster who are the main characters of the show: four women (Sun, Kala, Riley, and Nomi <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ), four men (Will, Wolfgang, Capheus, Lito).
-   From 2014 onwards, the main cast of _Silent Witness_ consists of this: two women (Nikki and Clarissa) and two men (Thomas and Jack). Previous seasons utilized Two Guys and a Girl (Leo and Harry with Sam or Nikki); the first three seasons focused solely on a woman (Sam).
-   _Skins_:
    -   The third generation consists of four girls (Franky, Mini, Liv, and Grace) and four guys (Rich, Nick, Alo, and Matty) during season 5. It doesn't stick for season 6, though, in which Alex joins the main cast, but since Matty is absent for the whole season except the premiere and the finale it may count as well.
    -   The first generation had more guys on the first season, but the inclusion of "Sketch" in the second evened the things into this trope: 5 guys (Tony, Sid, Chris, Anwar, and Maxxie) and 5 girls (Michelle, Cassie, Effy, Jal, and Sketch). The second generation, however, was predominantly-female, with 4 guys (Freddie, Thomas, Cook, and JJ) and 5 girls (Pandora, Effy, Katie, Emily, and Naomi).
-   _Sonny with a Chance_: The show has three girls (Sonny, Tawni, and Zora) and three boys (Nico, Grady, and Chad).
-   _Step by Step_: The Foster-Lambert blended family has the parents (Frank and Carol), three boys (J.T., Mark, and Brendan), and three girls (Dana, Karen, and Al). Downplayed because Frank's nephew Cody also joins the main cast in season 2 (though he doesn't live in their house but in his van).
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_: The main cast has three males (Zack, Cody, and Mr. Moseby) and three females (London, Maddie, and Carey). _On Deck_ averted this, as there were only two girls (London and Bailey) and never less than three guys (Zack, Cody, and Moseby, plus Marcus in Season 2 and Woody if you count him as a lead).
-   _Suits_: The show has a gender-equal ensemble. The 6 main characters are all equal gender-wise, Harvey Specter, Mike Ross, and Louis Litt for the boys, and Rachel Zane, Donna Paulsen, and Jessica Pearson for the girls.
-   The main cast members of the first season of _Supergirl (2015)_ consisted of three women (the titular protagonist, her Cool Big Sis Alex, and her boss and mentor Cat Grant) and three men (James Olsen, Winn Schott, and J'onn Jonzz).
-   _Survivor_ contestants consist of sixteen to twenty people with equal gender ratio. So far, there were only two instances of gender imbalance in the game's history. Both times due to contestants backing down for health reasons, and in both times the contestants were female.
-   _Teletubbies_: There are two boys (Tinky-Winky and Dipsy) and two girls (Laa-Laa and Po), along with a vacuum cleaner, Noo-Noo.
-   _The Thundermans_ has three females (Phoebe, Nora, and Barb) and three males (Max, Billy, and Hank). This was thrown off balance when Chloe joined the main cast in Season 3, but is re-balanced when you count Dr. Colosso. Even beforehand Colosso was arguably balanced out by Cherry, but this no longer fits with Chloe.
-   _Trapped_ usually had three girls and three boys competing in each episode, but series 3, episode 10 averts this with four boys and two girls competing instead.
-   _Victorious_: The main group consists of three girls (Tori, Jade, and Cat) and three boys (Andre, Beck, and Robbie), but it's ultimately thrown off when Trina is counted, though re-stabilized if Sinjin is counted.
-   _White Collar_: During season 3 the main cast consisted of three men (Neal, Peter, and Mozzie) and three women (Elizabeth, Diana, and Sara). However, the fourth season breaks this by having Clinton Jones join the main cast and have Sara Demoted to Extra.
-   _Will & Grace_: The main cast has two men (Will and Jack) and two women (Grace and Karen).
-   _Willow_: The party that goes after Airk has three men and three women (Willow, Graydon, Boorman vs Kit, Jade, Dove).
-   _Wizards of Waverly Place_: Alex, Harper, and Teresa for the females; Justin, Max, and Jerry for the males.
-   _Zoey 101_: Played straight in the first two seasons, with four girls (Zoey, Dana, Nicole, and Quinn) and four boys (Chase, Michael, Logan, and Dustin), with Lola replacing Dana in season 2. The trope still somewhat applies in seasons 3 and 4, with only three girls (after Nicole left the show) and three boys (Dustin, while still being part of the main cast, was pretty much Demoted to Extra).

    Music 

-   ABBA, whose name was based around the fact they had two girls beginning with A and two men beginning with B.
-   A-Teens, once began as an ABBA tribute group, also had two girls and two men.
-   The B-52s, after Ricky Wilson died.
-   Ace of Base (when both Linn and Jenny, in the bulk of their time, or Clara and Julia, afterward, were present)
-   Caramell, a Swedish Dance music group that consists of female singers Katia Löfgren and Malin Sundström, and male producers Jorge Vasconcelo and Juha Myllylä. All four band members appear in the performances.
-   Cornelius Brothers & Sister Rose was a band consisting of two male members and two female members.
-   Ladytron, in what's turned out to be a Long Runner Lineup
-   The Mamas & the Papas consisted of two men and two women.
-   My Bloody Valentine, another Long Runner Lineup (vocalist/guitarist Kevin Shields, vocalist/guitarist Bilinda Butcher, bassist Debbie Googe, drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig), which has actually been the official lineup on every record that hasn't undergone Canon Discontinuity. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Skillet
-   Throbbing Gristle, the era after Genesis P-Orridge's sex-change surgery and before Peter Christopherson's death.
-   little xs for eyes, with three female musicians who also sing together, and three men, one of whom sings on a few songs as well.
-   _Kagerou Project_ tells the story of some children with eye powers. Their cast is composed of a balanced male-female cast.
-   Disacode from 2010 to 2013: Female members Akira (vocalist) and Marcy (drummer) and male members Shun (bassist) and Daichi (guitarist). After Daichi left, the Visual Kei band became a Two Girls and a Guy Rock Trio with Shun being The One Guy.
-   Downplayed with "Les Ogres de Barback". It's a french band of four siblings (two men : Sam and Fred, and two women: Mathilde and Alice Burguière) but Léo, their brother born after the beginning of the band, accompanies them from time to time, (for example he was on stage for the 10th anniversary of the band)
-   Veruca Salt consists of two women and two men.
-   These are pretty rare in metal, but there are a few examples:
    -   Oakland-based Death Metal band Extremity: bassist Erika Osterhout, drummer Aesop Dekker, guitarist/vocalist Marissa Martinez (credited as Marissa Martinez-Hoadley in this band), and guitarist/vocalist Shelby Lermo. Despite his Gender-Blender Name, Lermo is male, and for bonus points, Martinez is transgender.
    -   Another of Martinez' bands, the San Jose-based death/grind act Cretin, _was_ an example until the departure of drummer Col Jones in 2015; the lineup was Martinez, Jones, Matt Widener, and Elizabeth Schall from 2013 to 2015. The band is now a rare inversion of The Smurfette Principle instead. That said, according to Metal Archives, they are still this trope when performing live, with Matt Harvey providing additional guitars (it's not clear what they do about drums), but he's not considered an official member.
    -   San Francisco-based Doom Metal band The Gault: guitarist John Gossard, bassist/vocalist Lorraine Rath, drummer Sarah Weiner, and vocalist Ed Kunakemakorn.
    -   Arlington Heights, IL/Portland, OR-based black/death metal band Ævangelist, which is a somewhat complicated case. Metal Archives lists Matron Thorn as male and Ascaris as female, but both members' gender expression comes across as non-binary (Ascaris is also transgender, according to her page on Metal Archives). Judging from interviews, this is entirely deliberate on their part; they've said they try to attack listeners' preconceptions as much as possible in as many fashions as possible, and subverting traditional gender stereotypes is one way they do this, though their actual gender identities also do seem to be at least somewhat non-binary.

    Pinball 

-   _Heist!_: Maggie's team consists of three men and three women.

    Podcasts 

-   Occurs in the _Cool Kids Table_ game _Creepy Town_. Between all the victims created there are six boys and six girls.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Thanks in large part to the Women's Evolution where the women are seen as legitimate wrestlers and not as eye candy as they were in the past, the WWE has become this, particularly on _NXT_ and to a lesser extent on _WWE Raw_ where there as just as plenty of women's matches as there are men's matches.

    Puppet Shows 

-   The main cast of _Donkey Hodie_ is comprised of girls Donkey Hodie and Duck Duck and boys Purple Panda and Bob Dog.
-   _The Pajanimals_ are the boys Apollo and Squacky and the girls Cowbella and Sweetpea Sue.
-   _Teletubbies_ has always had this. Two boys (Tinky Winky and Dipsy), and two girls (Laa-Laa and Po)
    -   Remains this way in the reboot with the addition of 4 boys (Daa-Daa, Ba, Ru Ru, Duggle Dee) and 4 girls (Mi-Mi, Ping, Nin, Umby Pumby).

    Tabletop Games 

-   The titular team in _Crimestrikers_, more or less. The book has entries for ten women, eight men, and a male-identifying robot. Add the team medic, who doesn't get his own entry, and the ratio becomes 10/10.

    Theatre 

-   _Godspell_ is originally scripted to have this (five boys and five girls), but due to the show's flexibility, it can vary wildly.
-   _On the Town_ - Three boys (Gabey, Chip, and Ozzie) and three girls (Ivy, Hildy, and Claire).
-   Jason Robert Brown seems to enjoy this trope. _Songs for a New World_ has a cast of two men and two women, spread evenly amongst the four major Voice Types, while _The Last Five Years_ has _a_ man and woman as its cast. _13_ breaks the mold, though it's sort of required to due to its Arc Number.
-   _Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_ is a drama involving an old married couple (George and Martha) and a younger one (Nick and Honey).
    -   The same works for other plays that feature two married couples, such as _God of Carnage_ or _The Bald Soprano_ (though the second one has two more characters, they are a maid and a fireman, so the trope is still played straight).
    -   _Ghost Quartet_ is performed by two men and two women. Deconstructed in that each performer plays many different characters, meaning that there end up being more female characters than male, but reconstructed in that it is revealed at the end that all of the characters played by each performer are really just one character reincarnated.

    Toys 

-   The _Lottie_ dolls franchise has two girls, Lottie and Mia, and two boys, Finn and Sammi.
-   Out of the main characters, Zhu Zhu Pets has four guys (Mr. Squiggles, Chunk, Scoodles and Winkie) and four girls (Pipsqueak, Num Nums, Jilly and Nugget). However Patches is sometimes added as a 5th main female character. In the books Rocky is the 5th main male.

    Video Games 

-   _Arc Rise Fantasia_: The final party, after all of Guest Stars are gone, consists of L'Arc, Rastan and Serge for men, and Ryfia, Cecille and Leslie for women.
-   The six party members of _Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout_ are evenly split between female (Ryza, Klaudia, Lila) and male (Lent, Tao, Empel).
-   _Backyard Sports_' original roster consisted of 15 boys and 15 girls (including a pair of brothers, a pair of twin sisters, and three brother-sister pairs), plus female play-by-play commentator Sunny Day paired with a different male color commentator for each sport. The pros were all male outside of the basketball and soccer games.
-   Both _Baten Kaitos_ games. The first has 3 males and 3 females, while the 2nd has 1 male, 1 female, and 1 Guillo (a Hermaphrodite Perverse Puppet Golem that uses Voice of the Legion, giving "it" both a male and female voice actor). It's eventually revealed Guillo was created from the combined spirits of two people, one male and one female, so even if _that_ is taken into account their team becomes two males and two females.
-   _Blazblue Cross Tag Battle_ features a base roster of 20 characters, 10 males and 10 females, though the expanded roster of currently confirmed characters actually features more women than men (DLC characters are in _italics_): the guys are Ragna the Bloodedge, Jin Kisaragi, Hazama, Azrael, Iron Tager, _Jubei, Hakumen_, Yu Narukami, Yosuke Hanamura, _Kanji Tatsumi_, Hyde, Gordeau, Waldstein and _Carmine_; the girls are Rachel Alucard, Noel Vermillion, Makoto Nanaya, Nu-13, Es, _Platinum the Trinity_, Chie Satonaka, Yukiko Amagi, _Aegis, Naoto Shirogane_, Linne, _Orie, Vatista_, Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, _Blake Belladonna and Yang Xiao Long_.
-   _Bomb Club_: The titular club is made up of 2 girls (Maggie, Blake) and 2 guys (Jon, Ian).
-   While the player characters of the _Borderlands_ series generally consists of three guys and a girl (not counting DLC characters), _Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!_ has two females (Athena and Nisha) and two males (Wilhelm and Claptrap). Granted, one of them is a robot but is generally addressed as male. The DLCs add a male and female (Jack Body Double and Aurelia), maintaining the pattern.
-   _Bravely Default_ has Tiz and Ringabel for the males and Agnes and Edea for the females. Its sequel, _Bravely Second_, keeps this up, replacing Ringabel with Yew for the new male and Agnes with Magnolia for the new female while keeping Tiz and Edea from before. _Bravely Default II_ goes for a whole new cast, with Seth and Elvis for the new males and Gloria and Adelle for the new females.
-   The complete Player Party in _Breath of Death VII_ consists of 2 guys (Dem and Erik) and 2 girls (Sara and Lita).
-   _Caveman Warriors_: The Player Characters are two guys (Jack and Moe) and two girls (Liliana and Brienne).
-   _Chaos Rings_ and _Chaos Rings Ω_ - The Agent summons four or five couples, each of which are a man and a woman.
-   _Chrono Trigger_ has Crono, Frog, and Robo for males, and Marle, Lucca, and Ayla for females. This has the potential to be offset by player actions later in the game: depending on whether or not the player revives Crono, whether or not Magus joins the party, and whether or not the player finishes Robo's Side Quest, the player can have anywhere from 1 to 4 male party members.
-   _The ClueFinders_ series has two girls (Joni and Leslie) and two boys (Santiago and Owen). Plus a talking, flying (male) computer.
-   _Crimson Sea_ has G-squad, which begins with three men and a woman, but which recruits two more women as the story progresses, balancing the numbers.
-   The first group of survivors in _Dead by Daylight_ were two guys (Dwight and Jake) to two girls (Claudette and Meg), but has been split into primarily male since. The Legion, who is a gang of teenage killers that plays as The Dividual in-game, has two guys (Frank and Joey) to two girls (Julie and Susie).
-   In _Dicey Dungeons_, the contestants are composed of two boys (Warrior and Thief), two girls (Inventor and Witch), and two nonbinary dice (Robot and Jester).
-   The _Dragon Age_ series is big on this:
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins_ has four female Companions (Morrigan, Leliana, Wynne, and Shale) and four male (Alistair who is optionally replaced by Teyrn Loghain, Sten, Zevran, and Oghren). And a (male) dog. However, you don't have to recruit _all_ of them, and depending on whether you view the Warden as an ensemble member, the balance can be tipped to either side.
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins – Awakening_ has Mhairi/Sigrun/Velanna for the female side and Anders/Oghren/Nathaniel for the males, though Mhairi doesn't survive her Joining at the beginning of the game. Further skewing the balance is the fact that the genderless Spirit of Justice possesses a male corpse. Other standalone DLC campaigns, however, are skewed to the male side heavily, ranging from one to no female companions (though in the one with none, the PC is a girl).
    -   _Dragon Age II_ follows the suit with four females (Bethany, Aveline, Merrill, Isabela) and four males (Carver, Varric, Anders, Fenris). However, Bethany and Carver are Mutually Exclusive Party Members and the DLC-only male Companion Sebastian can either restore the gender parity or skew it even further. The same Featureless Protagonist disclaimer applies to the Player Character.
    -   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ is the first main game to avert this trope in the Player Party, which has twice as many males (Varric, Cole, Solas, the Iron Bull, Dorian, and Blackwall) as females (Vivienne, Cassandra, and Sera). The balance is slightly improved with the addition of the three Advisers, one male (Cullen) and two female (Leliana and Josephine), to the Inquisition's inner circle, but it's still skewed towards the male side.
-   _Dragon Quest IV_: Possible in the NES version if the Heroine is chosen, with four women and four men. The PS1/DS version averts this by adding a male Sixth Ranger for the additional sixth chapter, Psaro.
-   _Dungeons of Aether_ stars four characters: Fleet and Artemis (female) and Slade and Hamir (male).
-   The base game of _Fallout: New Vegas_ has three men (Boone, Arcade, and Raul) and three women (Cass, Veronica, and Lily.) The DLCs skew it towards the male side with four men(Dog/God, Dean Domino, Follows-Chalk and Joshua Graham) compared to two women (Christine and Waking Cloud).
-   _Fear & Hunger: Termina_ has eight potential protagonists. Levi, Daan, O'saa and Marcoh are men, while Marina, Abella, Olivia and Karin are women.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy V_ starts out this way, with Bartz, Galuf, Reina, and Faris. Then Galuf dies, Krile joins the party and Bartz becomes The One Guy.
    -   _Final Fantasy VII Remake_ has Cloud, Barret, Tifa, and Aerith. Red XIII joins the group at the end as a Guest-Star Party Member.
    -   _Final Fantasy VIII_ - The main party consists of three guys (Squall, Zell, Irvine) and three girls (Rinoa, Quistis, Selphie). However, of the assorted Guest Star Party Members, four are male (Seifer, Laguna, Kiros, Ward) and only one is female (Matron).
    -   _Final Fantasy IX_ counts only if Quina is considered female, putting her alongside Garnet, Freya, and Eiko opposite Zidane, Vivi, Steiner, and Amarant.
    -   _Final Fantasy XII_ - three males (Vaan, Balthier, Basch) and three females (Ashe, Fran, Penelo) make up the main party. All Guest Star Party Members are male this time.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII_ - 3 main females (Vanille, Lightning, and Fang) and 3 main males (Sazh, Snow and Hope).
    -   _Final Fantasy Type-0_ - 7 main females (Rem, Deuce, Cater, Cinque, Sice, Seven and Queen) and 7 main males (Machina, Ace, Trey, Eight, Nine, Jack, and King).
-   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_: Two of the three eponymous houses are this.
    -   The Black Eagles have Edelgard, Bernadetta, Dorothea, and Petra for girls and Caspar, Ferdinand, Linhardt, and Hubert for guys.
    -   The Golden Deer have Claude, Raphael, Ignatz, and Lorenz for guys and Hilda, Leonie, Lysithea, and Marianne for girls.
    -   The DLC character house, the Ashen Wolves, also has two boys, Yuri and Balthus, and two girls, Constance and Hapi.
    -   Played With in regards to the Blue Lions. While the house proper has five boys (Dimitri, Dedue, Felix, Sylvain, and Ashe) and three girls (Ingrid, Mercedes, and Annette), the route-agnostic characters play it straight, as all three girls can be recruited to the Black Eagles or Golden Deer, but Dimitri and Dedue cannot, leaving Felix, Sylvain, and Ashe.
-   _Fire Emblem Engage_ does this with the returning protagonists from the initial reveal, choosing 6 males (Marth, Sigurd, Leif, Roy, Ike, and Byleth) and 6 females (Celica, Lyn, Eirika, Micaiah, Lucina, and Corrin).
-   _FUSE:_ The main team _Overstrike 9_ has two male members and two female members.
-   Both _Knights of the Old Republic_ games, depending on player choices (and ignoring the droids, who all have male personalities):
    -   In the first, with a female Player Character, there are four males (Carth, Zaalbar, Canderous, and Jolee) and four females (the Player Character, Mission, Bastila, and Juhani).
    -   In the second, if the player character is light sided on Nar Shaddaa (and thus gets Mira instead of Hanharr), the party again has four males (Atton, Bao-Dur, Mandalore, and Disciple or the Exile) and four females (Kreia, Mira, Visas, and Handmaiden or the Exile).
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, the Champions are equally divided by gender with two males (Revali and Daruk) and two females (Mipha and Urbosa). Even with including Link and Zelda, they still qualify.
-   In _Magna Carta 2_, Juto/Crocell/Argo are your male party members, whilst Zephie/Rue/Celestine are your females.
-   Zig-Zagged in the _Mass Effect_ series:
    -   _Mass Effect_ had three female squad members (Ashley, Tali, Liara) and three males (Kaidan, Garrus, and Wrex). However, one of each gender become Mutually Exclusive Party Members after a certain mission (Shepard must make a Sadistic Choice between leaving Ashley or Kaidan to die on Virmire).
    -   _Mass Effect 2_ is technically even, but at any given time will lean towards the male side as two of the women are Mutually Exclusive Party Members ( Samara and Morinth), and Legion is genderless. There's also a very brief Guest-Star Party Member, Wilson, who is male.
    -   If you have the full party in _Mass Effect 3_, then you can have Garrus/James/Kaidan as your male squadmates and Liara/Tali/EDI as your female squadmates. There is also a male DLC character called Javik who can tip the balance. However, he can also restore it, depending on how you see it, with males as Garrus/James/Javik and females as Liara/Tali/Ashley, with EDI as genderless.
    -   And through it all is Player Character Commander Shepard, whose gender is chosen by the player. Again, depending on whether you consider Shepard a party member, his/her presence can both re-balance or unbalance the ratios—or do both during the same game!, since Plotline Death is a thing that happens in this franchise.
    -   _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ has three females (Cora, Vetra, and Peebee) and three males (Liam, Drack, and Jaal). As before, you can choose what gender your protagonist is, though their Half Identical Twin brother/sister continues to be a character in the story. This extends to the _Tempest's_ non-combat crew, which is composed of two males (Gil and Kallo), and two females (Suvi and Lexi). This balance is also seen with the original four Pathfinders, which consist of a male human, a male turian, an asari, and a female salarian. Depending on the gender of the protagonist and a certain decision made late in the main story, the gender ratio can be kept equal, the new turian Pathfinder can become The One Guy, or the new asari Pathfinder can become a case of The Smurfette Principle.
-   _Mortal Kombat X_ does this with the new generation in story mode, with two males (Kung Jin, Takeda) and two females (Cassie, Jacqui).
-   _Octopath Traveler_ has eight protagonists evenly split between male (Cyrus, Olberic, Alfyn, and Therion) and female (Ophilia, Tressa, Primrose, and H'aanit) characters. To take it a step further, there's also an even split among those whose Path Actions are in the Noble (Ophilia, Tressa, Olberic, and Alfyn) or Rogue (Cyrus, Primrose, Therion, and H'aanit) categories.
-   _Onmyōji (2016)_'s main ensemble has two male members — Seimei and Hiromasa — and two female — Kagura and Yaobikuni — which becomes Two Guys and a Girl when Yaobikuni defects from the group.
-   _Overwatch_ has an equal cast of heroes, which may be skewed one way or the other as more are introduced in the future. There are currently fourteen females, fourteen males, and one genderless character to play as.
-   The main party in _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ consists of four males (Mario, Koops, Yoshi, and Admiral Bobbery) and four females (Goombella, Flurrie, Vivian, and Ms. Mowz). Ms. Mowz is an Optional Party Member, however, and this trope is averted without her.
-   _Persona_:
    -   _Persona 2: Innocent Sin_ is an interesting example; your party starts off as two guys (Tatsuya and Eikichi) and three girls (Maya, Lisa, and Yukino), but later becomes three guys and two girls after Yukino leaves and Jun joins.
    -   If you select Eriko as your optional party member in _Persona 2: Eternal Punishment_, you'll have three different girls (Maya, Ulala, and Eriko) and three different guys (Katsuya, Baofu, and Tatsuya) in your party over the course of the game.
    -   _Persona 3_ is a strange variation: If you count _all_ versions of the game as one, S.E.E.S.'s combat team includes six males (the male protagonist, Junpei, Akihiko, Shinjiro, Ken, and Koromaru) and six females (_Portable_'s female protagonist, Yukari, Mitsuru, Fuuka, Aigis, and Metis). However, the male and female protagonists are mutually exclusive, and Metis only appears in the _FES_\-exclusive Playable Epilogue.
    -   _Persona 4_ ends up having this. There's Yu, Yosuke, Kanji, and Teddie for the guys, and Chie, Yukiko, Rise, and Naoto for the girls.
    -   _Persona 5_ plays with this. The full crew is five boys (Ren (Joker), Morgana, Ryuji, Yusuke, and Akechi) and four girls (Ann, Makoto, Futaba, and Haru), but Morgana's gender is left ambigious in promotional material to the point where he admits that he isn't sure but refers to himself as male for the sake of convenience. The _Royal_ Updated Re-release adds a new member to the team, Kasumi, which balances out the team's gender ratio if one considers Morgana as male.
        -   _Persona 5 Strikers_ further enforces this trope if Morgana and Sophia are counted, resulting in five males (Ren, Morgana, Ryuji, Yusuke, and Zenkichi) and five females (Ann, Makoto, Futaba, Haru, and Sophia).
-   _Pilotwings 64_ has three male pilots (Lark, Goose, Hawk) and three female pilots (Kiwi, Ibis, Robin).
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Some games in the series, namely _Pokémon Diamond and Pearl_ and _Pokémon X and Y_, have an equal number of male and female Gym Leaders. _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ has two male and two female Kahunas.
    -   _White_ technically has six male Leaders and four female ones, but three of the guys are joint Leaders of the first Gym and you only face one of them, so gameplay-wise the trope is still played straight. Averted in _Black_, where Drayden is the Leader of the last Gym instead of Iris, bringing the total to five men vs. three women.
    -   With the exceptions of _Pokémon Gold and Silver_, _Pokémon Diamond and Pearl_, and _Pokémon Sun and Moon_, the Elite Four follow this to a tee.
    -   The main casts in both _Pokémon Black and White_ and _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ may become this if the player character is female. This results in two guys (Cheren and N and Gladion and Hau, respectively) and two girls (Hilda and Bianca and Selene and Lillie, respectively). _Sword and Sheild_ also go this route with Gloria and Marnie on the girls side, and Hop and Bede on the boys side.
    -   In _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_ the party that explores Area Zero will be this if the player chooses to play as Florian. If the player chose Juliana instead, then Arven becomes The One Guy alongside Juliana, Nemona, and Penny.
-   _Red Earth_ has four playable characters, with Leo and Kenji being men, and Tessa and Mai Ling being women.
-   _Scarlet Nexus_ is about as even as it gets. There are Yuito, Luka, Kagero, Gemma and Shiden for men, and Kasane, Hanabi, Tsugumi, Kyoka and Arashi for women. They are supported by Half-Identical Twins Wataru and Haruka. Both routes also have an ally who leaves early on and isn't playable - Nagi and Naomi - a guy and a girl.
-   _Shadow Hearts: From The New World_ was _going_ to be this, as the Pirate Girl Anne Lafitte was considered to be the eighth party member.
-   _Sonic Dream Team_'s playable cast consists of three boys (Sonic, Tails and Knuckles) and three girls (Amy, Cream and Rouge).
-   _Star Ocean_:
    -   _Star Ocean: First Departure_ is weird about it. While the complete lineup of the game is seven men and seven women, you can't get all of them at once due to one of them being a Guest Star, some other being Mutually Exclusive, and two characters even being the same person in different bodies.
        -   The core party, with Roddick and Ronyx for guys and Millie and Ilia for girls, is going to be with you in any playthrough.
        -   Besides the main four, you have four slots left. Most joining characters can be refused or avoided, so it's up to player to uphold this trope or not.
    -   _Star Ocean: Till the End of Time_ has six core party members (Fayt, Cliff and Adray for men and Maria, Sophia and Mirage for women). The last two members can be picked out of Nel, Peppita (female), Roger and Albel (male).
    -   _Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness_ has Fidel, Victor and Emmerson for guys and Miki, Fiore and Anne for girls. There's also Relia, but she's not a "true" playable character.
    -   _Star Ocean: The Divine Force_ plays with it. Technically, there are ten party members: Raymond, Albaird, Midas, Theo and J.J. for men, and Laeticia, Elena, Nina, Malkya and Marielle for women. However, Theo and J.J. are Mutually Exclusive Party Members, who join depending on the route (J.J. in Raymond's, Theo in Laeticia's), making the party on both routes dominated by women.
-   A staple of the _Tales Series_:
    -   _Tales of Phantasia_ has Cress, Chester, and Claus on the male side of the team while Mint, Arche, and Suzu are on the female side, with Suzu being only recruitable in the remakes (and even then, she's optional). Narikiri Dungeon X tipped the balance onto the female side with the inclusion of Rondoline.
    -   _Tales of Destiny_: Stahn/Leon/Woodrow/Johnny/Kongman and Rutee/Mary/Philia/Chelsea/Lilith. (Though Lilith was removed in the North American version)
    -   _Tales of Eternia_: Reid/Keele/Max and Farah/Meredy/Chat. Oh, and Quickie
    -   _Tales of Destiny 2_: Kyle/Loni/Judas and Reala/Nanaly/Harold.
    -   _Tales of Symphonia_: Lloyd/Genis/Zelos (or Kratos if you prefer)/Regal and Colette/Presea/Sheena/Raine
    -   At first glance _Tales of Rebirth_ avert this trope with Veigue Eugene/Mao/Tytree for males and Annie/Hilda for females, but there are Claire and Agarte who often tags along with the party and even has their own status screens. Both of them are female.
    -   _Tales of Legendia_: Senel/Moses/Jay/Will and Shirley/Norma/Chloe/Grune.
    -   _Tales of the Abyss_: Luke/Guy/Jade and Tear/Natalia/Anise.
    -   _Tales of Innocence_ has Ruca/Spada/Ricardo for males and Illia/Ange/Hermana for females. Updated Re-release adds Kongwai and QQ, but maintains the balance.
    -   _Tales of Vesperia_ has Yuri/Raven/Karol as the males and Estelle/Judith/Rita as the females. And a male dog.
        -   As of the Updated Re-release, it's Yuri/Raven/Karol/Flynn for the guys and Estelle/Judith/Rita/Patty for the ladies. and Repede.
    -   _Tales of Hearts_ has Shing/Hisui/Kunzite (male) and Kohaku/Innes/Beryl (female). Updated Re-release, however, averts the trope by adding Chalcedony and Gall, who are both males.
    -   _Tales of Graces_ gives us Asbel/Hubert/Malik on the male side and Sophie/Cheria/Pascal on the female side. _f_ tips the balance, however, and adds Richard.
    -   _Tales of Xillia_ has Jude/Alvin/Rowen and Milla/Elise/Leia.
        -   _Tales of Xillia 2_ seemingly avert this, but, given that there are two playable versions of one character, trope still in effect.
    -   _Tales of Zestiria_ has Sorey/Mikleo/Zaveid for males and Rose/Lailah/Edna for females. There is also Guest-Star Party Member Alisha (female) and Dezel (male), who maintain the balance in absence of someone above.
    -   _Tales of Berseria_ has Velvet/Magilou/Eleanor for females and Laphicet/Rokurou/Eizen for males.
    -   _Tales of Arise_ stars Alphen, Law and Dohalim, as well as Shionne, Rinwell and Kisara.
    -   Tales series loves this trope so much, that even most obscure _Tales of Mobile_ games follow the trend.
        -   _Tales of Breaker_ has Mika/Evelyn/Ruru and Yuteki/Saiber/Berger.
        -   _Tales of Commons_ has Alvin/Seiun and Sefina/You.
        -   _Tales of Wahrheit_ has Seltz/Blitz and Vila/Ray. It also has sort-of Team Pet Kalulu and Robot Buddy Gamut.
-   _Tokyo Xanadu_, made by the same people as the _Trails Series_, originally looked to play this trope straight in most of their original advertisements, with a party of 6 consisting of a male and female in each year. Then came the announcement of a 7th main character, and the balance became tipped. As such, there are now 3 males (Kou, Yuuki, and Shio) and 4 females (Asuka, Sora, Mitsuki, and Rion) classified as main characters. However, when one adds in the 5 most prominent supporting characters (Gorou, Ryota, and Jun for the males, Shiori and Towa for the females), the sides even out with 6 members each.
-   The _Trails Series_ sometimes does this with its main party, but often skews the balance in favor of the girls:
    -   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky First Chapter_ has four female party members (Estelle, Scherazard, Kloe, and Tita) and four male party members (Joshua, Olivier, Agate, and Zin). Through the first four chapters of the game, only Estelle and Joshua are permanent members with the other characters rotating in and out of the remaining two slots, with you always getting one new male and one new female in each chapter (Scherazard and Olivier in Chapter 1, Kloe and Agate in Chapter 2, Tita and Zin in Chapter 3). They even join in alternating order.
        -   _Second Chapter_ seems to break this by adding a new male party member (Kevin) to the original eight. However, there are three additional party members that join in the Final Chapter, one male (Mueller) and two female (Josette and Lieutenant Schwarz). There are also two Guest Star Party Members over the course of the game, with Anelace being female and Kurt male. _The 3rd_, however, tilts the balance in favour of women by bringing back all the main party members from the previous game, including the Eleventh Hour Rangers, promoting Anelace to full party member status, and adding three new characters, two of whom (Ries and Renne) are female and only one of whom (Colonel Richard) is male.
    -   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero_ has 4 consistent party members, 2 male (Lloyd and Randy) and 2 female (Elie and Tio). Even when the sequel, _Trails to Azure_ brings in more, it's a single male and female (Wazy and Noel, respectively).
    -   ZigZagged in _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_; at first Class VII have 5 males (Rean, Elliot, Machias, Jusis, and Gaius) and 4 females (Alisa, Laura, Emma, and Fie), but Sara, their female instructor, occasionally joins in. Later on, they get 2 more New Transfer Students (the male Crow and the female Mirium). Then at the end of the game, Crow is revealed to be an enemy, meaning that, for _Trails Of Cold Steel II_, this trope is either played straight or not depending on if you count Sara, as she is technically a semi-permanent party member.
        -   The New Class VII in _Cold Steel III_ consists of male teacher Rean, male students Kurt and Ash, and female students Juna, Altina, and Musse. By the end of _Cold Steel IV_ though, the two Class VII's combined makes for 8 males and 9 females, tipping the balance.
    -   The main characters of _The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie_'s third route consist of two males (<C> and Swin) and two females (Lapis and Nadia). When it comes to the combined party, things become much less even: in the main story there are 17 male characters<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and 23 female characters<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Even with the True Corridor characters added in, only 5 guys<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  were added, in contrast with the 6 additional girls<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . By the end, there are 22 males and 29 females.
    -   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak_ is shown to have 8 characters classified as its main cast: 4 males (Van, Aaron, Quatre, and Bergard) and 4 females (Agnes, Feri, Risette, and Judith). _Kuro II_ does away with this by taking Bergard out of the story, while only adds 2 males (Swin and Kincaid) in contrast to the 4 additional females (Elaine, Nadia, Renne, and Shizuna).
-   _Triangle Strategy_: The main cast, Serenoa and his war council, amounts to 4 boys (Serenoa, Roland, Benedict, and Erador) and 4 girls (Frederica, Geela, Anna, and Hughette). This gets unbalanced in every ending path besides Conviction, where one of them leaves your party after Chapter XVII's vote.
-   _Trick & Treat_: The official Steam store image<small>◊</small>, has two guys and two girls on it.
-   As of the _Exe:Late\[st\]_ update, _Under Night In-Birth_ has an evenly split roster with 10 males and females each.
-   _A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky_ exhibits this in the final party lineup (Ivy, Lief, Gainer, and Yvette) as well as the Silver Spring city council. However, this is averted with the villains, who are all male.
-   The kids you can play as in _A Walk in the Woods_ are two boys and two girls.
-   The investigation team in _White Noise Online_ is made up of two boys and two girls.
-   _Wild ARMs_ series:
    -   While the original _Wild ARMs_ doesn't qualify due to featuring only three people - Rudy and Jack for guys and Cecilia for the girl, its remake _Wild ARMs Alter Code: F_ adds one guy - Zed, and two girls - Jane and Emma.
    -   _Wild ARMs 2_ has three male playable characters (Ashley, Brad, and Tim) and three females (Lilka, Kanon, and Marivel).
    -   _Wild ARMs 4_ has two guys (Jude and Arnaud) and two girls (Yulie and Raquel).
    -   _Wild ARMs 5_ has three male playable characters (Dean, Greg, and Chuck) and three females (Rebecca, Avril, and Carol).
    -   _Wild ARMs XF_: Clarissa and Felius; Levin and Labrynthia; Alexia and Ragnar. Oh, and Tony.
-   The team in _Yuuyami Doori Tankentai_ consists of two girls (Kurumi and Sango) and two boys (Nao and Meros).

    Visual Novels 

-   _Danganronpa_:
    -   The first game, _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, starts with eight male and eight female students. However, there are initially thought to be fifteen students, seven male and eight female, which is reversed once Chihiro is posthumously revealed to be male. It becomes equal again when the mastermind is revealed to be one of the students and is female. The game ends with six survivors equally split - three male, three female.
    -   _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_ starts out with 16 students - eight male, eight female. There are also two mascots: Monokuma (male) and Monomi (female). The game ends with three male and two female survivors. However, since none of the students actually died and Chiaki was an AI, it’s actually eight males and seven females.
    -   The Gaiden Game _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_ has 8 characters with significant screen time — four of each gender.
    -   While this is initially played straight in _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_, having the same evenly split 16 characters of the other main games (counting the robotic K1-B0 as male), it is ultimately subverted at the end of the game, in which only _three_ characters survive, two female (Maki and Himiko) and one male (Shuichi).
-   The Kazama Family in _Majikoi! Love Me Seriously!_ is made up of five girls, four boys, and a robot who is treated like a male. Later, another guy joins the team, making it an actual one of these. Conveniently enough, around this time, the robot gains a female form and freely switches between being male and female from that point forward.
-   The team in _SC2VN_ ends up with two guys (Accel and Stunt), two girls (Jett and Reva), and the player character (who can be either).

    Web Animation 

-   Object Shows:
    -   _Battle for Dream Island_: There are 10 males and 10 females in the first season, minus the Announcer, 11 males and females in the second and third seasons, _32_ on both sides in the fourth season, and 20 for the fifth. Averted with the introduction of David late into season 1.
    -   _Obama's Hidden Info Objects_: After Paper Baggy's debut, the cast is divided into four females (Chocolate Bar, Paper Baggy, Record Case and Sweater), four males (69, Bobux, DDPFP and Space) and four others (Pan Flag, Street Sign and Wii U are non-binary while 420's has yet to be confirmed)
    -   _Unconventionally Centered_: The nine castmembers' gender is perfectly split between male (? Block, Monitor and Toasty), female (Discord Message, Feathry and Science Book) and other (PC, Beach Ball and Windowy in which the former is genderless while the other two are non-binary).
-   _BIGTOP BURGER_: The staff of the eponymous food truck consists of two men (Tim and Steve) and two women (Penny and Billie).
-   _RWBY_: Team JNPR consists of two male/female pairs (Jaune and Pyrrha and Ren and Nora), balancing each other's strengths and weaknesses and each having romantic elements. Jaune has a natural gift for leadership, but lacks combat skill; Pyrrha is star athlete who excels in combat but is inclined to provide support and takes responsibility for training Jaune. She quickly falls for him, but it takes him longer to realise. Ren is a quiet, serious student with practical ninja-influenced combat techniques while Nora is a fast-talking, high-energy powerhouse; they've been together since a young age and are often mistaken for a romantic couple. Pyrrha's death in Volume 3 leaves the team imbalanced and reeling for many volumes. During Volumes 4-5 they temporarily form Team RNJR with Ruby, who pairs with Jaune as two leaders that support each other's decisions and choices. This trope ends with the reunification of the all-female Team RWBY at the end of Volume 5, after which, the two teams function as a super-team that includes Oscar as Team JNR's adopted, unofficial "fourth".
-   The main cast of _Subway Surfers: The Animated Series_ consists of two girls and two boys: Jake, Fresh, Tricky, and Yutani.

    -   Hazbin's sister series _Helluva Boss_ also has a gender-balanced main cast of two males (Blitzo and Moxxie) and two females (Millie and Loona). Subverted when the male Stolas is included, though he's often accompanied by either his ex-wife Stella or his daughter Octavia.
-   The main cast of _Chikn Nuggit_ consists of three males (Chikn Nuggit, Sody Pop and Bezel), three females (Cheezborger, Slushi and Cofi), and two agender characters (Iscream and Fwench Fwy)

    -   The original series starts off with Katara being the only girl for two boys (Aang and Sokka), but then Toph joins the team in the second season and balances things out. It unbalances briefly and balances out again when Zuko and then Suki join the group.
    -   _The Legend of Korra_ also does this now that Asami is part of the team of Korra (originally the one girl of the Freudian Trio), Mako and Bolin. One could also count Tenzin and Lin and Naga and Pabu without upsetting the balance.
-   _Blue's Clues_ has seven major male characters (Steve/Joe \[assuming they are counted as one role\], Mr. Salt, Cinnamon, Mailbox, Shovel, Slippery Soap, and Periwinkle) and seven major female characters (Blue, Mrs. Pepper, Paprika, Sidetable Drawer, Pail, Tickety Tock, and Magenta).

A third episode features Diego, Baby Jaguar, and Rescue Pack, all male, working with the female camera, Click, Diego's sister Alicia, and her female lasso.
-   _Hero Elementary_ has two girls (Lucita and Sara) and two boys (Benny and AJ). If you include Mr. Sparks and Fur Blur, it still counts.
-   _Hoze Houndz_: The team is Hozer, Steamer, Squirt (boys), Fontaine, Crystal, and Brooke (girls).
-   The first season of _Kaeloo_ started out with Kaeloo as the only girl, but the second season made it so that there are four males (Stumpy, Quack Quack, Mr. Cat and Olaf) and four females (Kaeloo, Pretty, Eugly and Olga<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> )
-   _Let's Go Luna!_ has four main characters, two of which (Luna the moon and Carmen the butterfly) are female while the other two (Andy the frog and Leo the wombat) are male.
-   _The Magic School Bus_: Ms. Frizzle's class has four boys (Arnold, Ralphie, Carlos, and Tim) and four girls (Phoebe, Dorothy Ann, Keesha, and Wanda), though this is thrown off-balance when Frizzle herself is counted and even more so with the class pet Liz.

-   On _The Mighty Ones_, Berry and Rocksy are girls while Twig and Leaf are guys.
