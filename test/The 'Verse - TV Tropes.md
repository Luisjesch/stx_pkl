The 'Verse is usually referred to with a show or franchise identifier (such as Buffyverse, Whoniverse, etc.). It is a crafted combination of setting-elements that define the rules for how the world works and sometimes provides for sharing of characters and continuity across more than one series. A Shared Universe refers to a fictional universe with multiple authors.

In terms of how things work within the universe, the Buffyverse for example is set up by Mutant Enemy in such a way that Our Vampires Are Different in a (fairly) uniform fashion, and certain characters can move back and forth between shows and refer to events on the other show as if they are in the same world. Such things are often defined in the Universe Bible, the one true repository of Canon. These bibles may be condensed to a Universe Compendium, or published as a Universe Concordance. Some universes, the shared variety especially, have a pretty strict and orderly Canon. Others, especially those with many authors, spread across different media and over a long period of time, go all over the place. Most of them reside somewhere in-between.

Many 'verses have a thriving life in Expanded Universe form and spawn Tie In Novels, movies, comics and fanfic. However, these spin-offs may or may not count as Canon.

The origin of the name is contested. _Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction_ credits Orson Scott Card as the inventor of this term. Card himself says that his publisher was responsible for adding _Enderverse_ to the jacket of one of his books, and he neither invented the term nor likes it. The term could also have originated from the fandom of Joss Whedon works, which take place in a shared universe. An earlier term coined by Robert A. Heinlein, _ficton_, has never gained much currency outside of Science Fiction circles; similarly, the related (but subtly different) term _mythopoeia_ is mostly known to fans of J. R. R. Tolkien, who coined the term 1930s.

One notable thing about the creation of Crossover verses is that it is usually easy to link two or more works which contain no Speculative Fiction elements or major departures from actual history, but doing so with Speculative Fiction works can be difficult because the settings are more likely to contradict each other. For instance, the characters from two Dom Coms, or two Westerns, or even a Dom Com and an action drama can typically all bump into each other with no logical problem. But to declare that, say, _Star Trek_ and _Babylon 5_ exist in the same world is very awkward because both have detailed future histories, catalogs of nearby alien races, and rules about physical laws which bear little to no resemblance to each other. This can be a headache for s.f. franchises (Hi, DC!) who try to merge unrelated verses together into a single whole.

Quite often confused with Shared Universe. A Shared Universe refers to a fictional universe written by more than just one or two _real-world creators or authors_. Also not to be confused with Expanded Universe which refers to a kind of secondary canon to the main Canon, in other media. See also the closely related term Canon. See also Canon Welding, Alternate Continuity and Intra-Franchise Crossover. And while we'd hope this doesn't need to be noted, it should probably be said anyway: a Shout-Out, Production Throwback, or any casual referencing between two works on their own _does not mean_ they inhabit a verse. If that were that case, nearly every single piece of fiction would inhabit the same universe, and the Tommy Westphall Multiverse Hypothesis is enough of a headache as it is.

For works featuring a multitude of universes, realities and timelines, see The Multiverse.

More recent movies exist under the DC Universe Animated Original Movies label, but with the exception of the two _Superman/Batman_ films, all the movies before _Justice League: War_ don't share continuity—and even afterwards, there's some not in that continuity, as _Batman: Assault on Arkham_ is tied to the _Batman: Arkham Series_, not the universe started in _War_, and _Justice League: Gods and Monsters_ is an Elseworlds.

While many other established, licensed verses have been peripherally tied to the MU (the worlds of The Elric Saga, Doctor Who, and the Transformers have all been shown to be part of the larger Marvel Multiverse), only Conan was integrated quite so solidly into Marvel Earth's history, with ties to the Serpent Crown, the evil wizard Kulan Gath, Namor's Atlantis, etc. Marvel no longer owns the comic book rights to Conan, and can no longer directly mention that section of Marvel Earth's history until 2019.

-   Nasuverse, the 'Verse of Kinoko Nasu, including _Fate/stay night_, _Tsukihime_, _The Garden of Sinners_, their sequels, spinoffs and some other writings. Notable because it is a unified universe, but contains only the tiniest of crossovers between the main lines. Also a massive headache in terms of Canon, since while the several main franchises share a common universe, the main works are multipath games that are inherently Alternate Universes... or something.

The extended Nick Verse also includes _Big Time Rush_ and _The Naked Brothers Band_ and _every actor who played a role on any of those shows_ as well as the cast of _All That_ due to a Throw It In attitude to continuity which means Celebrity Paradox is averted and all the characters who look like the stars are considered separate people.

    Anime and Manga 

### **By Creator:**

-   Works by Akira Toriyama, such as _Dragon Ball_ and _Dr. Slump_, exist in the same universe, with Arale and Senbei having made several guest appearances on _Dragon Ball_ while Goku has had a few cameos on _Dr. Slump_. Arguably _Nekomajin_ also exists somewhere in the Dragon Ball universe, since one of the characters claims to have been trained by Goku and featured a Saiyan named Onio.
    -   There's also _Jaco The Galactic Patrol Man_, which is revealed in the end to be a prequel to _Dragon Ball_, in which the title character is sent to find a dangerous threat to Earth, which turns out to be an infant Goku. Bulma's sister is a main character, and both she and Jaco make appearances in _Dragon Ball Super_; in fact, Jaco is something of a recurring character.
-   The universe centered on the CLAMP school. And, in a larger sense, the entire _CLAMP_ multiverse (as shown in _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_).
-   Not only do most if not all of Cool-Kyou Shinsha's works take place in the same universe (well, _Frau Rabbit_ technically takes place in another dimension), but most of them are implied to take place in the same fictional town of Ooborozuka (based on the real life Koshigaya in the Saitama prefecture).
-   Ken Akamatsu's verse (aka the Negiverse), which seems to encompass _A.I. Love You_, _Love Hina_, _Itsudatte My Santa!_, _Hito Natsu No Kids Game_, _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ and Negima's sequel series _UQ Holder!_. Also _Mao-chan_, the cast of which once visited the Hinata Inn (from _Love Hina_), where they (most probably) met Naru.
-   Most of Kouji Seo's works (_Cross Over_, _Suzuka_, _A Town Where You Live_, _Princess Lucia_, _Fuuka_, and his latest series, _Hitman_) take place in the same universe.
-   Nekota Yonezou has a much more subtle one, with only three of her many works sharing an universe, _Hidoku Shinaide_, _Elektel Delusion_ and _Otona Keikenchi_, mostly, there a few extra chapter crossover that shows a few characters know each other from different mangas.
-   Shoko Hidaka has a verse in the form of a nigh-anthology of her works _Signal_, _Arashi No Ato_ and _Hatsukoi No Atosaki_. Each one is considered a sequel to the previous one, in which a side character of the work before becomes the main character for the following one, but the events of other works are hardly central in any form.
-   Sho Shibamoto's mangas, _The Jackalope_, _Pandemonium Wizard Village_, _Flower Knight Dakini_, and some of his one-shot stories share the same universe. The main connecting threads are the Sky Golems and mutant animals called Variants/Rare Ones.
-   Shungiku Nakamura is particularly known for having two popular works of the Yaoi genre, _Junjou Romantica_ and _Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi_, that often make clear that are happening on the same universe, with characters of both making cameos on the other, and even a shared setting, as both stories focus on people that work on the same publishing company.
-   Sunrise's _Toward Stars_ universe includes _Outlaw Star_ and _Angel Links_.
-   Tohru Fujisawa's manga _GTO: The Early Years_, its prequel _Bad Company_, and its sequel _Great Teacher Onizuka_ form the core of the "GTO-verse", which also includes the GTO Interquel _14 Days in Shonan_, the sequel _GTO: Paradise Lost_, and the spinoffs _GT-R: Great Transporter Ryuji_, _Ino-Head Gargoyle_, and _Shonan Seven_. His manga _Kamen Teacher_ and _Animal Joe_ have had crossovers or cameos with some of the previous series, Canon Welding them to the GTO-verse.
-   The Blameverse of Cyberpunk / Body Horror manga master Tsutomu Nihei. So far consisting of, in rough chronological order:
    -   _Noise_
    -   _Blame!_
    -   _Blame^2_
    -   _Netsphere Engineer_
    -   When his later manga _Biomega_ came out, it was widely believed to be an even earlier prequel, due to various similarities, including an organization known as Toha Heavy Industries appearing in both, but according to Word of God, _Biomega_ has its own continuity.
-   Manga artist Yoshiru Konogi managed to make one out of her second manga, "_Henjo - The Strange Female High-Schooler Amaguri Senko_", by way of expanding the arcs of certain characters from the said manga into the two spin-off series, "_The Honest Princess and the Minus Prince_" and "_Attack on Eroko_".

### **By Title:**

-   _A Certain Magical Index_ and _A Certain Scientific Railgun_ are often referred to as the "Raildex" verse. With the addition of _A Certain Scientific Accelerator_, there's some discussion about expanding the name, but no one can really agree on anything that doesn't sound ridiculous. The Japanese version is usually "To Aru" ("A Certain"), which is more inclusive.
-   Oddly enough, the brightly coloured, Hot Blood\-filled Super Robot series _GaoGaiGar_ and its sequels are said to take place in the same world as the twisted Real Robot/horror hybrid series _Betterman_.
-   "Turn A Space" as a way of uniting all _Gundam_ series preceding _Gundam SEED_ into one continuity. Named after _∀ Gundam_, which attempted to do this as a last hurrah for the franchise.
    -   The name comes from the supposed original concept of _∀ Gundam_, wherein creator Yoshiyuki Tomino intended to unite **every** anime he had created into a single universe; this is often used in lieu of the original nickname "Turn A Bang" (since _Turn A_ was part of the "Gundam Big Bang Project" of 1999).
    -   The "Turn A" in the title describes an inverted "A", the mathematical symbol meaning "For all", used in equations describing statements that apply to every member of a set.
-   The _Pretty Cure_ multiverse.
-   The sixth and seventh episodes of _Space Patrol Luluco_ imply that it's set in the same universe as _Kill la Kill_. Presumably _Inferno Cop_ is in too, since it's pretty obvious that's who Over Justice is anyway. Whether or not any other Studio TRIGGER or Hiroyuki Imaishi series' get in is yet to be seen, although this is already in the running for the most awesome 'verse in history.
    -   In episode 8, Luna Nova is the main setting and Sucy makes an extended cameo.
    -   Episode 9 takes it even further and gives us a crossover with _SEX and VIOLENCE with MACHSPEED_, and then proceeds to destroy the planet it was set on.
    -   Episode 11 confirms that Inferno Cop himself was a former member of the Space Patrol. And he was friends with Over Justice.
    -   Episode 13 confirms that _all_ of Trigger's original works take place in the same universe when Luluco is revealed to be Trigger-chan, who's job is to patrol the various dimensions/series.
-   The Tenchiverse — home to the _Tenchi Muyo!_ OVA series, _Tenchi Muyo! GXP_, _Tenchi Muyo: War on Geminar_ and, reportedly, _Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure_.

    Comic Books 

### **By Creator:**

-   Archie Comics has one consisting of _Archie Comics_, _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_, and _Josie and the Pussycats_. This also applies to their reboot.
-   Chimaera Studios' superhero comics always took place in a shared universe, but it wasn't obvious aside from a few cameos/references until Chimaera Studios released its first team book, _Consortium of Justice_ and used to connect a few other titles.
-   Corey Lewis's one-shot graphic novel _PENG_ takes place in the same universe as Lewis's graphic novel series _Sharknife_. Rocky Hallelujah, the main character of PENG, is the younger brother of Sharknife's protagonist Caesar Hallelujah. Additionally, Scott Pilgrim makes a one-page cameo in PENG, so if you really want to, you could consider that series as part of the same universe as well.
-   The DC Universe and Marvel Universe are two of the most widely recognized universes in comics.
-   The Motterverse: Consists of Mr. X, Electropolis and Terminal City, all created by Dean Motter.
-   Within the Chaos God story arc in the Disney Adventures series, _Darkwing Duck_, _DuckTales (1987)_, _TaleSpin_, _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_, and _Goof Troop_ all take place in the same universe. Arguably, _Quack Pack_ as well.
-   Image Comics originally tried doing that. The first few issues of their early titles had Continuity Nods to other titles, and there were a few outright crossovers. But as time went on, every Image partner focused on their own titles, creating de-facto sub-universes that had less and less to do with each other. Marc Silvestri's and Jim Lee's titles maintained their connections longer then others, but eventually, even that feel by the wayside. In 1997, Wildstorm Universe, Top Cow Universe and Rob Lielfeld's Extreme Universe were written out of Image Universe via what can be best described as Reverse-Crisis on Infinite Earths in the _Shattered Image_ mini-series (not to be confused with the more tongue-in-cheek _Splitting Image_ mini-series). Since then, there have been a number of Image crossovers, but each creator was free to decide just how much that counts in their continuity.
-   The Millsverse consists of everything Pat Mills wrote in British comics, including such strips as _ABC Warriors, Nemesis the Warlock, Invasion!, Savage,_ and _Flesh_. The Dreddverse may be a subset, Depending on the Writer.
-   Robert Kirkman's verse contains _Invincible_, _Invincible Presents: Atom Eve and Rex Splode_, _The Astounding Wolf-Man_, _The Pact_, _Guarding the Globe_, _Brit_, _Capes_, _Tech Jacket_, _Haunt_, _Superpatriot: America's Fighting Force_, and _Superpatriot: War On Terror_. Pretty big for a fictional universe written by one guy.
-   The main titles created by Terry Moore (_Strangers in Paradise_, _Echo_, _Rachel Rising_ and _Motor Girl_) occupy a shared continuity sometimes called "The Terryverse". Characters from SIP occasionally appeared in _Echo_ and _Rachel Rising_, while Rachel and Lilith from RR appeared in an SIP revival in 2018. The four properties merged into a Crisis Crossover starting in May 2019 called _Five Years_, in which they have to prevent a group of weapons designers from completing work on the Phi Bomb, a new weapon that would destroy all hydrogen atoms on Earth and then spread out to the rest of the universe.

### **By Title:**

-   _Fables_ is a surprisingly very large and expanded universe not created by a major company. It includes the main series Fables, Peter and Max: A Fables Novel, Jack of Fables, The Literals, Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall, Fables: The Last Castle, Cinderella: Fables are Forever, Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love, Fairest, and a Telltale Games series that is confirmed to be canon.
-   The Dreddverse consists of _Judge Dredd_ and its various spinoffs, primarily _Judge Anderson, Low Life, Armitage, Shimura,_ and _The Blood of Satanus_. _Strontium Dog_ was shoved in sideways in "Top Dog" and "Judgement Day". Nobody's sure whether the Millsverse is part of it. _Harlem Heroes_ is also part of the Dreddverse, at least in Broad Strokes, since Judge Giant is the grandson of Aeroball star John "Giant" Clay.

    Fan Works 

## **By Author:**

-   Most of Dark Mark's _DC Universe_ fanfics are interconnected. They are set in the same continuity or in different parallel Earths, whose characters occasionally interact with each other. Thus, the events of _Kara of Rokyn_ gave birth to the universes explored in _Hellsister Trilogy_ and _A Force of Four_, whose main characters have worked together sometimes, and _Superman of 2499: The Great Confrontation is set five hundred years after_ Hellsister Trilogy''.
-   Eduard Kassel has taken a different approach to this trope, by stating that all of his stories are set, not in the same universe, but in the same _multiverse_. They're usually tied loosely together by cameos from or mentions of common elements — such as the Stranger, the Endless Council, and the threat of Omega — but even those that don't have those are still stated by Word of God to be in the same multiverse as the others.
-   Evilhumour and his co-writer Anon e Mouse Jr. have, like Eduard Kassel, written a number of fics (based on _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_) that are set in the same multiverse (the "The Powers That Be" multiverse); the worlds all originated from the same source, and each is home to its own set of Powers That Be.
-   "The United Pony of Goodness Universe" (or "TUPGverse" for short), on which most of JusSonic's stories take place. It also includes _Past Sins_ and most of its verse.
-   Fanfiction author KhaosOmega's concept of multi-dimensional traveling that can cross between _entire multiverses_. While most stories in it to be inspired by other writers' works, there are a few that actually link in:
    -   The earliest-dated occurrance in Khaos' chronology (using the name "Khaos Time System" (often abbreviated as KTS) to refer to the "meta-timeline") is former author WitChan's "Kart Racer" - which started out as a Khaos-made suggestion. Officially dated as late 2010s to early 2021.
    -   Through a pair of Christmas-themed stories, Stevie Bond's Galaxy Angel Retold series (which inspired Khaos' own Galaxy Angel II story that created Jace Davies) and Willgm's Galaxy Angel Intervention (which Stevie had already crossed with his own, described as happening between the end of Stevie's Galaxy Angel II Retold trilogy and somewhat of a DOOM-spliced Galaxy Angel III-esque story) link in via use of Stevie's OC Arnold Williams and Will's OC William Johnson. Takes place in consecutive years, 2677 and 2678 (the latter extends into 2679).
    -   Khaos has since made plans to tie in Paradigm of the Rose as more Timeline 1802 energies are relocated by Rainbow Angel Kandyce Azeat. Based on how one sequence Khaos has planned for it goes the timeline placement hints at being in the vicinity of Jet's stint at Duel Academy and Anise's wild-card run in the Tournament of Power during the 28th century.
-   Trinary's Dashverse is likewise a series MLP:FiM stories set in a universe where instead of Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash became Celestia's student.

## **By Title:**

-   The _Blooming Moon Chronicles_, by Black.Rose.Raven, an MLP fanfiction series that draws heavy inspiration from Norse Mythology. Along with its sequel series, _Songs Of Lost Children_, it contains 15 books and at least a dozen side-stories, mostly written by Black.Rose.Raven himself.
-   _Bolt From The Blue_ shares many ideas and characters with _Black Sky_ but is explicitely a _multiverse_ fic. It helps that _Reborn! (2004)_ canonically uses multiples universes.
-   _"Bonds Beyond Species"_ is a _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfic by Yasahiro. It's set in the same verse as their other fics "Hands" and "Versus Equestria".
-   There is the _Buildingverse_ shared mainly by the Mega Crossover fancomic _Roommates_ and its largest and most popular Spin-Off _Girls Next Door_ by two separate authors (some canon differences suggest Alternate Continuity though), which also seem to encompass by the definition of most fans (and Approval of God) the whole Expanded Universe around them consisting of other Spin Offs like _Down the Street_ and many more.
-   _Child of the Storm_ is the first story in a vast universe which so far consists of that first completed book, a completed second one, an ongoing third one and two shorter side-stories. According to the author, there's plenty more to come.
-   All of the _Doctor Who_ fics on Rich's ComixBlog, including _The 10 Doctors_, are all self-contained within their own universe. This fan-verse also includes _Forever Knight_ and _Jem_ via crossovers.
-   The _Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness_ verse based on an alternate-POV telling of _Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows_.
-   In _The Elements of Harmony and the Savior of Worlds_, events in the original My Little Pony cartoon happened in the ancient past of _Friendship is Magic_. It also shares the same universe as the other 80s Hasbro cartoons: _The Transformers_, _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero_, _Jem_, _Inhumanoids_, and _Dungeons & Dragons (1983)_, called the Hasbroverse. It also includes Doctor Who.
-   TheDrunkenWerewolf's _Heirverse_ Has been in progress for almost ten years and spans four chapter fics plus a dozen side stories and counting.
-   _Infinity Train: Blossomverse_ is a trilogy of crossovers involving _Pokémon: The Series_ and _Infinity Train_ that also has help from the author of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_.
-   _Life in Manehattan_ is, like the Lunaverse and the Cadanceverse above, a Shared Universe of MLP fics set in an Alternate Universe, one where the events of the pilot episodes took place in Manehattan rather than Ponyville. As such, Twilight instead ends up befriending and having adventures with several secondary, minor, and background characters.
-   _The Mansionverse_ welded several unrelated fancomics of _The Haunted Mansion_ together with some official media, ending up with something entirely original.
-   The _Oneiroi Series_ and its various branching realities.
-   The Order of the Gray Demons, centered on _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ Fanfic _Birds of a Feather_ by Solid Shark. Somewhat notable amongst Fan Fic 'verses for having multiple authors and contradictory accounts.
-   _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ by Crossoverpairinglover started as a _Pokémon_ AU fic that has expanded into a growing shared universe centered by the titular fic with numerous one shot spin offs and side stories.
-   _RainbowDoubleDash's Lunaverse_ is a Shared Universe of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fics set in an Alternate Universe where Celestia, rather than Luna, went crazy and had to be sealed away, and the Elements of Harmony end up going to six minor and background characters.
    -   And coming from one of the authors of the Lunaverse is The Cadanceverse, another Shared Universe, where _both_ Celestia and Luna went insane and had to be sealed by Cadance, and the Elements of Harmony end up going to five minor and background characters and Fluttershy<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   The Reading Rainbowverse is a series of independently maintained blogs set in the same verse as Rainbow Dash Reads Homestuck. There is a very strong sense of continuity and interaction, with all the blogs commenting on each other's shenanigans. It even deals with Tumblr as a whole by referring to it as the multiverse, interacting with out of verse blogs as though they were alien visitors....
-   _School Daze_ is in the same universe as _Choices_, _The Three Whooves_, _A Nightmare in Ponyville_, and _Doctor Whooves and the House of Daring_.
-   _Ships Ahoy!_ is the first story in an Expanded Universe that spans across three sequels (one of which also serves as a prequel), two of the author's other _Odd Squad_\-related works, and a contest based on the story which spawned three additional stories (although none of them tie into the universe).
-   Ponky's The Sisters Doo is in the same universe as Through The Looking Glass, And What Pinkie Found There. Also, come 2015, he's going to add a TSD sequel to that verse, as well as a story starring Dinky.
-   _There Was Once an Avenger From Krypton_, usually referred to by the author as "the Kryptonverse" for short, is a collection of stories crossing over various series with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While they rarely directly interact, it's established that they all exist in the same universe and will occasionally reference each other.
-   _Weiss Reacts_ is set in one of these, called the Reactsverse, sharing a world with other oneshots by the author and a sister fic, _The Diary of Glynda Goodwitch_. It also shares a _multiverse_ with _Lucina Reacts_ by the same author, focusing on _Fire Emblem: Awakening_.

    Films — Live-Action 

## **By Creator:**

-   The Happy Madison Universe, or the "Sandlerverse", consists of nearly the entirety of films from Adam Sandler's studio Happy Madison Productions that feature Inexplicably Identical Individuals given the differing roles of Sandler. These include _Happy Gilmore_, _Billy Madison_, _Big Daddy_, _The Waterboy_, _The Wedding Singer_, _Little Nicky_, _Joe Dirt_ and its sequel, _Mr. Deeds_, _Eight Crazy Nights_, _The Longest Yard_, _Grandma's Boy (2006)_, _Click_, _I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry_, _Grown Ups_ and its sequel, and _That's My Boy_
    -   _Happy Gilmore_'s Chubbs Peterson is seen in Heaven in _Little Nicky._
    -   In a non-Happy Madison connection, Callahan Auto from _Tommy Boy_ is referenced in dialogue in _50 First Dates_; a medical center there is also named the Callahan Institute, the implication being it was one of the beneficiaries of Callahan's philanthropy.
    -   The character Whitey Duvall, the high-voiced elderly basketball referee, debuted in Sandler's one-shot album _Stan and Judy's Kid_, had a cameo appearance in _Little Nicky_, and was the deuteragonist of the Happy-Madison animated film _Eight Crazy Nights_.
    -   Farmer Fran from _The Waterboy_ shows up in _Joe Dirt_.
    -   Rob Schneider's "You can do it!" Cajun is in _Little Nicky_, _The Waterboy_, and _The Longest Yard_.
    -   A cop played by Dan Patrick appears in both _The Longest Yard_ and _I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry_.
    -   The children's book "The Puppy Who Lost His Way" features in both _Chuck and Larry_ and _Billy Madison_.
    -   The O'Doyle family from _Billy Madison_ (the surviving ones anyway) are the neighbors of the main character of _Click_. Sandler still hates them.
    -   The minister officiating the marriage ceremony in _That's My Boy_ is Father Shakalu, who was known as Doctor Shakalu in _Grandma's Boy (2006)_.
    -   Nazo, the food delivery guy played by Rob Schneider in _Big Daddy_, cameos in _Mr. Deeds_.
    -   Eric Lamensoff, Kevin James' character _Grown Ups_, is name-dropped in _Click_ _and_ _The Wedding Singer_.
-   Most Jacques Demy films are interconnected. In _Model Shop_ (1969), Lola's story of being a nightclub singer in France and meeting an American sailor is the plot of 1961 film _Lola_; Anouk Aimee plays the character of Lola in both movies. She says her husband left her for a lady gambler named Jackie Lemaistre; the character of Jackie Lemaistre is the protagonist of 1962 Demy film _Bay of Angels_. _Lola_ also features as Lola's boyfriend a character named Roland played by Marc Michel; Michel plays the same character in 1964 Demy film _The Umbrellas of Cherbourg_. Demy's follow-up to Cherbourg, _The Young Girls of Rochefort_, has characters make references to it as well as _Lola_.
-   J. J. Abrams' Cinematic "Abramsverse":
    -   The one official is the _Cloverfieldverse_, which all started when the self-contain movie originally call _The Cellar_ was retooled by Abrams and called _10 Cloverfield Lane_ for publicity purposes although the link between the two movies on camera is thin to say the least (the expanded universe connects the two worlds more thoughtfully). Then it came the turn for "God's Particle", a sci-fi movie for Netflix which was also retooled to be part of the same universe and renamed _The Cloverfield Paradox_, in this case the connections were made much more obvious and explicit. This, however, caused a certain backlash from critics which caused the idea to be dropped. In fact _Overlord (2018)_ was rumored to be branded "Cloverfield 4" but this was eventually abandoned due to _Paradox_'s backlash. Currently a four Cloverfield movie as a direct (and this time planned) sequel from the first is in talks.
    -   Some fans also consider _Star Trek (2009)_ and its sequels and _Super 8_ to be in the same Abramsverse due to the drink Slusho mentioned on them, which also exists in _Alias_ and _Fringe_ from the same creator arguably placing the _Star Trek_ franchise (at least the Kelvin line), _Super 8_, _Alias_, _Fringe_ and the Cloverfield movies in the same universe.
-   The Shermer movies of John Hughes all share a common universe (the "Shermerverse"). In a 1999 _Premiere_ article, Hughes himself declared that _Sixteen Candles_, _The Breakfast Club_, _Ferris Bueller's Day Off_, and _Planes, Trains and Automobiles_ coexist with each other. Sadly, the crossover possibilities were never explored in film.
    
    **John Hughes:** When I started making movies, I thought I would just invent a town where everything happened. Everybody, in all of my movies, is from Shermer, Illinois. Del Griffith from _Planes, Trains and Automobiles_ lives two doors down from John Bender. Ferris Bueller knew Samantha Baker from _Sixteen Candles_. For 15 years I've written my Shermer stories in prose, collecting its history.
    
    -   It's long been speculated that _Pretty in Pink_, _Some Kind of Wonderful_, and _Home Alone_ also take place in the Shermerverse, since those movies were written (but not directed) by Hughes and feature similar themes. Adding on to that, there is mixed evidence that _Uncle Buck_ and _Curly Sue_ (both directed by Hughes) might take place in the Shermerverse, but this hasn't been confirmed.
    -   _Weird Science_ explicitly takes place in Shermer (Lisa is seen teaching the Shermer High gym class at the end), though it has its own Speculative Fiction internal logic that is inconsistent with the other canon Shermerverse movies. Hughes' 1988 movie _She's Having A Baby_ does NOT take place in the Shermerverse, since Neal Page's wife is seen watching that movie on television in _Planes, Trains and Automobiles_.
-   Leigh Whannell implies _The Invisible Man (2020)_ is possibly the same universe as his other film _Upgrade_ since the Silent Antagonist in the former is said to have allegedly founded the company from the latter.
-   According to Michael Bay, it's implied that the 2009 reboot of _Friday the 13th_ and the 2007 _Transformers_ movie (and thus the _Transformers Film Series_ altogther), all of which he produced, are actually set in the same universe since Jerk Jock Trent DeMarco, a character played by actor Travis Van Winkle, makes a Character Overlap in both films. That's right, apparently Jason Voorhees coexists in the same world as the Autobots and Decepticons of Cybertron.
    -   It is unknown if other Platinum Dunes Remake productions such as _A Nightmare On Elm Street_ (2010), _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_ (2003), or the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ reboot are included as well.
-   Over the years, Quentin Tarantino's movies have developed into _two_ relatively coherent 'Verses - the first being the main "Tarantino-verse" which turns out to be an Alternate History where the Bastards killed Hitler in '44 and the second the films within that verse. It also seems be linked to his friend Robert Rodriguez' world too, and include some of his favorite older movies.
    -   Vincent Vega and Mr. Blonde (Vic Vega) from _Pulp Fiction_ and _Reservoir Dogs_, respectively, are supposed to be brothers.
    -   Big Kahuna Burger, a fictional fast food chain has been seen in _Pulp Fiction_ and _From Dusk Till Dawn_. Apple Cigarettes has also appeared in many of his films such as the _Kill Bill_ series. Sheriff Earl McGraw, from _Kill Bill Vol. 1_ also appears in Tarantino's _Grindhouse_ segment _Death Proof_.
    -   _Inglorious Basterds_ shows it's ultimately an Alternate History off-shoot of ours considering that several liberties with history were taken in one notable scene.
    -   The 1998 crime film _Out of Sight_, starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, is implied to be part of it as well as Michael Keaton's character, Ray Nicolette from _Jackie Brown_ makes a Character Overlap.
        -   _Out Of Sight_ and _Jackie Brown_ are both Elmore Leonard adaptations, hence sharing a character. That does not mean they share the same universe with anything not adapted from Leonard's work.
    -   Word of God has it that Shaft is apparently a descendant of Django and Broomhilda **von Shaft** from _Django Unchained_.
-   As for Robert Rodriguez, Machete Cortez, played by Danny Trejo, appears in both the fun family-friendly _Spy Kids_ movies and the super-violent, 18-rated _Machete_ duo.

## **By Title:**

-   _Alien_, _Predator_, and _Alien vs. Predator_ according to Fox are all in the same universe. This includes all the movies, comics, books, and video games. Except for _Prometheus_. Ridley Scott deliberately ignored the events of the _Alien vs. Predator_ films because he hated them so much.
    -   It's also worth noting that _Predator_ and _Alien_ were never meant to be in the same universe, _Alien vs. Predator_ was mainly created as a cash-in on two popular franchises.
    -   But it's worth mentioning that the whole idea of fusing these two franchises was born due to an Easter Egg at the ending of _Predator 2_, where you could see the Predator's wall of fame on their ship, with various skulls, including (what seems to be) a xenomorph's.
        -   Some commentators have pointed out that the skull looks like a xenomorph but could be of any other alien, in reality wasn't confirm until much later.
    -   And long before the movies, the crossover was done by Dark Horse Comics making this a case of Older than You Think.
    -   And as the Weyland Yutani company exists in both the _Star Trek Online_ videogame and the _Angel_ and _Firefly_ TV shows (see the Live Action Television section) made of that what you will. An interesting fact is that an episode of _Star Trek: Voyager_ has a (deliberately) very similar looking species (but benevolent) to the Predator aliens named the Kradin.
-   _Barton Fink_ and _Hail, Caesar!_ are connected through featuring the same fictional studio, Capitol Pictures.
-   _Can't Hardly Wait_ and _Josie and the Pussycats_ (2001) are possibly set in the same universe as "Huntington High School" is mentioned in both movies.
-   _The Fast and the Furious_ movies and the crime-thriller _Better Luck Tomorrow_ may share a universe as Badass Normal Han (Sung Kang) appears in both franchises.
-   Maybe downplayed, but Todd Phillips' _The Hangover Trilogy_ and his 2003 comedy _Old School_ might be in the same world as the Dan Band cameo in both _Old School_ and the first _Hangover_ movie.
-   The _Happy Death Day_ trilogy and the 2020 Slasher comedy _Freaky_ are part of the same universe from filmmaker Christopher Landon.
-   The "Wizarding World" as is called is the universe that encompasses the cinematic world of the _Harry Potter_ series, the planned prequel pentalogy of _Fantastic Beasts_ and the sequel play _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_.
-   The Marvel Cinematic Universe. Since the release of _Iron Man_ in 2008, the MCU has been steadily expanding into one of the biggest media franchises of all-time with multiple films, TV shows, web mini-series and counting; loads of tie-in material and merch like nobody's business... and it shows no signs of stopping or even slowing down. Moreover, it basically codified the idea that movies with _wildly_ varying tones could not only share a universe, but have characters regularly crossing over and meeting each other.
-   The MonsterVerse: After the release of _Godzilla (2014)_ with Warner Bros. and the reveal that they were working on a _King Kong_ reboot with Universal, Legendary Pictures announced that they were using the former to kickstart a kaiju-focused cinematic universe. The _Kong_ reboot, which changed distribution from Universal to Warner Bros. and is titled _Kong: Skull Island_, established King Kong within the universe, followed by _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ (which brought Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah into the universe as well) and _Godzilla vs. Kong_, pitting Godzilla and Kong against each other.
-   _A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th_ have been in one universe starting with _Freddy vs. Jason_. _Evil Dead_ will be too if you consider the comic _Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash_ canonical.
    -   Plans for a third movie featuring Pinehead from the _Hellraiser_ franchise were in place during production as they all belong to the same company at the time and even were talks about adding a small cameo of Pinehead in a post-credit scene (although it was later replaced by Jason holding Fredy's head as they both came out of the water).
-   The 1991 thriller _Ricochet_ is in the universe of the _Die Hard_ franchise mainly with anchor Gail Wallens (Mary Ellen Trainor) making a character overlap. John Amos, from _Die Hard 2_, also stars but plays a different character.
-   The Duke Brothers (Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy) from _Trading Places_ make an overlap cameo in _Coming to America_ in one funny scene. Both movies starred Eddie Murphy and were directed by John Landis.
-   The _X-Men Film Series_ have gone beyond just having Professor X and Co. save the day to Wolverine getting his own set of movies; Deadpool in his own stand-alone, fourth wall-breaking adventures (...sort of) featuring the X-Force; along with the New Mutants getting a Spin-Off.
    -   Both _The Gifted (2017)_ and _Legion (2017)_, while referencing events of the above universe, each are supposedly set in stand-alone continuities of their own.
-   The View Askewniverse consists of everything Kevin Smith made that featured Jay and Silent Bob. It includes _Clerks_, _Mall Rats_, _Chasing Amy_, _Dogma_, _Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back_, _Clerks II_, _Jay and Silent Bob Reboot_ and _Clerks III_. Plus a bunch of tie-in comics.
    -   Based on their cameo in _Scream 3_, it may also include the films of the _Scream_ series.

    Literature 

### **By Author:**

-   Almost all of Agatha Christie's works are in the same fictional universe. While Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple never met, a few supporting characters pop up in books featuring both of them, and Miss Marple's fictional home village of St. Mary Mead is also mentioned in a Poirot novel. Minor characters also tie in the Tommy and Tuppence series, as well as several of Christie's one-off novels like _Sparkling Cyanide_, _Towards Zero_, _Passenger to Frankfurt_, and _The Man in the Brown Suit_. Incidentally, Christie herself (or a fictionalisation of her) exists in 'verse, as a character in _The Body in the Library_ mentions having obtained her autograph. There are a few exceptions among the one-off stories: ironically one of the Christie novels with no connections to the rest of the universe is probably her most famous one, _And Then There Were None_.
-   Many of the fiction works of Andrew Greeley — including but possibly not limited to the _Bishop Blackie, Nuala Anne McGrail_ and _Angel_ books, plus _The God Game_ — appear to all take place in the same shared universe.
-   Most of Brandon Sanderson's adult fantasy (with a few exceptions, such as the three _The Wheel of Time_ books he's published on behalf of the deceased Robert Jordan), take place on different worlds in the same universe, known as _The Cosmere_. This is not made clear in the books themselves (although several contain hints) but is information provided by Word of God.
-   Bret Easton Ellis's novels. The narrator of _Less Than Zero_ (Clay) appears in _The Rules of Attraction_, and narrates one chapter. One of the narrators of _The Rules of Attraction_ (Sean Bateman) appears in _American Psycho_. The narrator of _American Psycho_ (Patrick Bateman) appears in _Glamorama_, whose narrator, Victor, is a minor character in _The Rules of Attraction_. Characters from _Less Than Zero_, _The Rules of Attraction_, and _American Psycho_ also appear in the short story collection _The Informers_.
-   Cassandra Clare's _The Shadowhunter Chronicles_ consists of the original _The Mortal Instruments_ series, prequel trilogy _The Infernal Devices_, sequel trilogy _The Dark Artifices_, _The Last Hours_ (sequel trilogy to _The Infernal Devices_), _The Wicked Powers_ (sequel trilogy to _The Dark Artifices_), _The Eldest Curses_ (spin-off trilogy focused on Alec and Magnus), _The Shadowhunter Codex_ (guide book) and three collections of short stories: _The Bane Chronicles_, _Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy_ and _Ghosts Of The Shadowmarket_, all taking place in the Shadowhunter world.
-   All of Christopher Moore's novels take place within the same universe, with locations and characters (both major and minor) taking on new, often very different roles in other books. This reached a peak during _You Suck_ (itself a sequel to _Bloodsucking Fiends_), where a scene from _A Dirty Job_ was retold from a different point of view. This is also the first time where a crossover with one of Moore's earlier novels doesn't make sense unless you read the book in question.
-   Colin Bateman's books take place in the same universe. Dan Starkey, the Anti-Hero of one particular series has been mentioned in the Mystery Man series and makes an appearance in the once-off novel _I Predict a Riot_.
-   Author C.T. Phipps has FuturePunk for all of his science fictories and The United States of Monsters for all of his urban fantasy stories. Interestingly, both of these universes and some others have crossed over with his The Supervillainy Saga universe, making them all one big multiverse.
-   Daniel Handler's universe, commonly referred to as the 'Snicketverse', contains _A Series of Unfortunate Events_, _All the Wrong Questions_, and _Poison for Breakfast_.
-   David Eddings has several:
    -   Belgariad Universe, home to _The Belgariad_, _The Malloreon_, _Belgarath the Sorcerer_, and _Polgara the Sorceress_.
    -   Elenium/Tamuli universe, home to _The Elenium_ and _The Tamuli_.
    -   The Dreamers Universe.
-   David Mitchell's books are noted for their interconnectivity. This is true within single stories (the wondering soul in one of _Ghostwritten_'s narratives, whose travels take it full-circle); within single novels (_Ghostwritten_ and _Cloud Atlas_ which are both made up of several independent but connected stories), and between novels (and other works). For example, a character from the Frobisher narrative in _Cloud Atlas_ features prominently in _Black Swan Green_. A minor character from Marco's narrative in _Ghostwritten_ starts his story by waking up to a woman whose birthmark marks her as an iteration of the 'soul' that links all of the narratives in _Cloud Atlas_. The list goes on and on. Even in Mitchell's latest book, _The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet_, which was seen as a departure from his previous meta/post-modernist fiction into fairly 'straight' historical drama, there is at least one very subtle connection to his earlier book _Number 9 Dream_: the minor character Satsuki Miyake comes from Yakushima, hinting that she is the ancestor of Eiji Miyake, protagonist of the earlier work, who also hails from the tiny island. Insofar as Mitchell is writing about the 'real world', past or contemporary, this Verse is quite close to our own. However, Mitchell is also notable for writing science fiction elements into his books. If, as seems to be the case, all Mitchell's works are taking place in the same Verse, we are left to try and reconcile the end of _Ghostwritten_ (which implies the self-aware super-computer created by the nice Irish scientist has decided to annihilate mankind) with the future-set episodes of _Cloud Atlas_ (in the first instance a Soylent-Green\-referencing consumerist dystopia; in the second instance a far-future-set 'last days of humanity'). The possibilities are fascinating...
    -   _The Bone Clocks_ goes even further and connects almost all of his previous novels and fleshes out the entire multiverse. In particular, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob DeZoet is directly connected with Dr. Marinus revealed as an _Eternal Hero_ and Enomoto's immortality cult as legitimate magic. The future setting of _Cloud Atlas_ and some background on the Prescients are also tied into it.
-   The Alternate History _1632_ by Eric Flint is often referred to as the 1632-verse, or the Ring Of Fire-verse, to distinguish it from the author's other alternate history series (including the _Trail of Glory_ series). This also includes the novels _Time Spike_ and _The Alexander Inheritance_ which occur in the general universe but are based on different time jaunts.
-   Prolific children's author Enid Blyton have various of her more fantastical works being set in the same universe, starting with her _1926_ book _Book of Brownies_ featuring a minor character named the Saucepan Man, who becomes an Ascended Extra in _The Faraway Tree_ a decade later. Several magical lands from _Faraway_ would also reappear in the later book, _The Wishing Chair_.
-   Erich Maria Remarque did this; characters from _All Quiet on the Western Front_ appear or are referenced in his later works.
-   H. Beam Piper had his "Terro-human Future History", including the novels _Four-Day Planet_, _Uller Uprising_, _Little Fuzzy_ and its direct sequels, _The Cosmic Computer_, _Space Viking_, and various short stories, chronicling (albeit very intermittently) thousands of years of human history, including the rise and fall of The Federation, the (eventual) rise of the First Galactic<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Empire (a hardnosed but rather more benevolent than usual example of "the Empire"), and eventually (by the time of the final story by internal chronology that is generally including in this canon, "The Keeper") the _Fifth_ Galactic Empire—by that point at least thousands if not tens of thousands of years into the future. These stories are linked by a common history (including a nuclear war on Terra which left the northern hemisphere devastated, meaning the human race's interplanetary and eventually interstellar civilization is based in South America, South Africa, and Australasia), the use of the "Atomic Era" to date things (its epoch being the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, in 1942 of the Gregorian calendar), various bits of shared tech ("contragravity"; "collapsium", a form of super-dense matter suitable for building armor that can withstand _direct hits from nuclear weapons_; spaceships equipped with both "Abbott lift-and-drive engines" and "Dillingham hyperdrive engines"; and a notable lack of ray guns until quite late into the "future history"), and assorted call-backs and shout-outs from one work to another.
-   One of the oldest examples may be Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen's "Simplicianischer Zyklus", which includes, besides the eponymous _Simplicissimus_, his other stories "Trutz Simplex oder Lebensbeschreibung der Ertzbetrügerin und Landstörtzerin Courasche", "Continuatio des abentheuerlichen Simplicissimi Oder Der Schluß desselben", "Der seltzame Springinsfeld" and "Das wunderbarliche Vogelnest".
-   All of Ian Rankin's books (apart from Creator's Oddball _Westwind_) share a 'verse — even, thanks to subsequent Canon Welding, the thrillers he wrote under the pseudonym Jack Harvey.
-   Isaac Asimov's Robot stories form a rough timeline of events. Some time soon, there will be robots for every type of job, and supercomputers networked around the world. Most of the short stories take place between now and then. At some point in The Future, a schism occurs between those who like the robots and those who hate the robots. Those who like robots use their labour to colonize new worlds (calling themselves Spacers), leaving Earth to the robot-haters, who start to outlaw robots with human-level AI (calling themselves Earthers). This is when the Elijah Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw stories take place. According to _Robots and Empire_, Bailey has inspired Earth's interest in space colonization, which will eventually become a single Galactic Superpower, which bridges this series into the _Empire_ and _Foundation_ stories.
-   Much of James Alan Gardner's writing takes place in _The League of Peoples 'Verse_.
-   A good portion of John Buchan's books (including _The Thirty-Nine Steps_) are set in the same continuity, and many of his series shared supporting characters.
-   Almost all of Kim Newman's works take place in a multiverse, a number of specific strands of which can be identified.
    -   Newman's 1990s novels _Bad Dreams_, _Jago_, _The Quorum_, and _Life's Lottery_ (technically a multiverse in one novel, given its Gamebook structure) share certain characters and all take place in a version of modern Britain in which the supernatural hides below the surface. _An English Ghost Story_ returns to this universe.
    -   The _Diogenes Club_ stories, _The Hound of the D'Urbervilles_, the _Drearcliff Grange School_ novels<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and _Angels of Music_ take place in a universe which also includes versions of characters from the previously described universe, but in which the supernatural is more visible, with various two-fisted vigilantes and outright superheroes being public figures during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The key distinction between the two universes is that the British Shadow knock-off Doctor Shade is definitely fictional in the former, but real in the latter.
    -   _Anno Dracula_ is a different but closely related universe in which Dracula seduced and married Queen Victoria, leading to a world ruled by open vampires. This universe also uses versions of characters from his Warhammer novels, implying that those are just another branch-off universe as well.
    -   Newman's first novel _The Night Mayor_ is medium-future cyberpunk SF with no overt supernatural elements, but a line in _Bad Dreams_ implies that its protagonist is descended from a character in that novel.
-   Larry Niven is noted for two popular settings in particular, _Known Space_, and _The Magic Goes Away_. His penchant for co-authors means that many angles on these settings have been written.
    -   _Known Space_ could be considered to be part of the _Star Trek_ universe now that the _Star Trek: The Animated Series_ was upgraded to canon as the Kzinti make an appearence in one of the episodes. In fact the Expanded Universe even went further by making the already canonical Caitans into distant relatives of the Kzinti (like an inverted version of the Vulcan-Romulan relationship) and the cat lady in _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_ was referred to as a "Kzinrrett" (Niven's term for female Kzinti) though never on camera.
    -   Niven and co-author Steven Barnes have created at least one distinct Verse together, that of Cowles Industries' Dream Park. _The Descent of Anansi_ is set there, along with the Dream Park novels and a role-playing game.
-   Madeleine L'Engle's eight Murray-O'Keefe books and the Austin stories are part of the same continuity, along with several of L'Engle's other books:
    -   The novels _The Small Rain_ (1945) and _A Severed Wasp_ (1982) have Katherine Forrester as the protagonist (as an adolescent in _The Small Rain_ and an old woman, now widowed, in _A Severed Wasp_); she also appears in the Chronos novel _A Ring of Endless Light_ as a pianist at a concert that Vicky and Zach attend, identified only by her married name of Vigneras.
    -   The novel _Ilsa_ (1946) features Ilsa Brandes as the protagonist; the novel also introduces the Renier family, who are prominent in the Kairos novels _Dragons in the Waters_ and _A House Like a Lotus_.
    -   The novel _And Both Were Young_ (1949; later reissued with alterations in 1983) has Philippa "Flip" Hunter as the protagonist; Katherine Forrester owns one of her paintings in _A Severed Wasp_.
    -   The novels _Camilla Dickinson_ (1951; later reissued with alterations as _Camilla_ in 1965) and _A Live Coal in the Sea_ (1996) have the titular Camilla Dickinson as the protagonist; Camilla's best friend is Luisa Rowan, whose older brother Frank appears in the Kairos novel _A House Like a Lotus_.
    -   The novel _A Winter's Love_ (1957) features Virginia Bowen Porcher as the protagonist; she is one of Polly O'Keefe's favorite authors in _A House Like a Lotus_ and is married to Henri Porcher, a descendant of Henry Porcher from _Ilsa_. Virginia's best friend is Mimi Oppenheimer, who reappears in _A Severed Wasp_ as a neighbor of Katherine Forrester Vigneras.
    -   The novel _The Other Side of the Sun_ (1971) includes members of the Renier family, who were introduced in _Ilsa_.
    -   The novel _Certain Women_ (1992) features Emma Wheaton as the protagonist and includes an appearance by Canon John Talis, who was introduced in _The Arm of the Starfish_ and also appeared in _The Young Unicorns_ and _Dragons in the Waters_.
    -   The only novels _not_ explicitly part of this continuity are:
        -   _The Love Letters_ (1966; revised and reissued in 2000 as _Love Letters_), which stars Charlotte Napier; _Certain Women_ has Emma Wheaton perform in a play featuring a scene from Charlotte's life, implying _The Love Letters_ is a work of in-universe fiction.
        -   _The Joys of Love_ (2008) follows four days in the life of Elizabeth Jerrold in the 1940s and has no known links to L'Engle's other works.
-   Manta Aisora's verse, consisting of _Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!_, _Miyamasanchi no Berutein_ and _Valkyrie Works_. Confirmation comes thanks to Crossover Cameos both blatant and subtle (a radio show in _Miyamasanchi no Berutein_ gets a write-in request from "Crawling Chaos", which is obviously meant to be Nyarko).
-   Michael Connelly has been writing mystery novels more or less annually since 1992 and they all take place in the same universe. About 2/3 of them feature the same detective, Harry Bosch, but even the ones that don't tie in to the Bosch universe. The hero in _Chasing the Dime_ suffered a childhood trauma when his sister was murdered by a Serial Killer who was eventually killed by... Harry Bosch. The heroine of _Void Moon_ later has a cameo in a Bosch novel. Connelly's first non-Bosch novel, _The Poet_, could easily have been a stand-alone book. Instead Connelly has a character read a newspaper article by a reporter mentioned in Bosch novel _The Last Coyote_, just to make clear the book takes place in the Bosch universe.
-   Minoru Kawakami created his own world, called "The Foundation World", in his light novels. A more in-depth explanation can be found translated here, but essentially, it consists of a large universe happening over thousands of years and divided into six specific eras during which the works take place centuries apart from each others: _FORTH_, _AHEAD_, _EDGE_, _GENESIS_, _OBSTACLE_ and _CITY_. The official timelines goes:
    -   FORTH: The world as it is now. It's the setting for _Rapid Fire King_.
    -   AHEAD: After conquering ten parallel worlds, we must make their own Concepts part of our universe lest it be destroyed. It's the setting for _The Ending Chronicle_.
    -   EDGE: When mankind discovers space travel, and leaves the Earth That Was. The discovery of a fuel from AHEAD allows for further development. It's the setting for _On A Godless Planet_.
    -   GENESIS: The stage when the world ends and a time where Technology Marches On In-Universe and FORTH is all but forgotten. It's the setting for _Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere_.
    -   OBSTACLE: When the world rebuilds and destroys itself countless times. It's the setting for _Clash of Hexennacht_.
    -   CITY: When all the technologies developed from OBSTACLE come together, and, after the world was recreated countless times, a world that would not be destroyed is created. It's the setting for the _CITY Series_.
-   Neal Stephenson has used a shared universe to set a number of his books in. _Cryptonomicon_ introduces a number of characters, including the Waterhouse family, Shaftoe family, and Enoch Root. _The Baroque Cycle_ features ancestors of the Waterhouses and Shaftoes as well as Enoch Root. While _REAMDE_ does not show any signs of being set in the 'verse, its sequel _Fall, or Dodge in Hell_ features descendants of the Shaftoes and Waterhouses as well as Root himself, revealing that all six books take place in the same universe.
-   The P. G. Wodehouse verse in which the gentlemen of the Jeeves and Wooster, Blandings Castle and Psmith series know each other, often through the Drones Club. Specific links include _Leave It to Psmith_, in which Psmith and Freddie Threepwood team up for a Zany Scheme at Blandings Castle; _The Code of the Woosters_, in which Bertie Wooster mentions Freddie as one of his acquaintances; and "Jeeves Takes Charge," where Bertie mentions Lord Emsworth and Blandings Castle. There's even a connection to his earlier school stories — in "The Ordeal of Young Tuppy", Tuppy Glossop is revealed to have attended St Austin's, the setting of _The Pothunters_ and _Tales of St Austin's_.
-   Robert A. Heinlein had _The Future History,_ a chronology spanning from the 1950s to many centuries into the future. It was written from 1939 to 1987, meaning parts of it were Alternate History by the end. It turned into a multiverse (The World As Myth 'Verse) near the end, with a set of crossovers that brought some of his non-Future History stories into The Verse. (Not to mention crossovers with the Oz series, _Alice in Wonderland_, and _all fiction ever written_. It got weird.)
-   Robert E. Howard's _Conan the Barbarian_ and _Kull_ series take place in the same 'verse, with Conan's Hyborian Age forming after the great cataclysm that destroyed Kull's Atlantis. Kull has a guest appearance in the Bran Mak Morn story "Kings of the Night," linking it to Howard's historical stories. In addition, his modern day Conrad and Kirowan horror stories are linked, as Thoth-Amon's Ring of Set makes an appearance in "The Haunter of the Ring." It's arguable that all of Howard's stories occupy the same 'verse.
-   The Naritaverse, for lack of a better term, entails the four light novels _Baccano!_, _Vamp!_, _Etsusa Bridge_, _Hariyama San_, and _Durarara!!_, written by Ryougo Narita. There is only some overlapping here and there, though, and never enough to change plot lines.
-   Several of Sinclair Lewis's novels take place in the fictional state of Winnemac (surrounded by Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana).
-   Stephen King's 'Verse, which spins around _The Dark Tower._ Almost every novel he has ever written makes some small mention to at least one of his others. He is even a part of his own 'Verse, referred to in _The Tommyknockers_ as "that fellow who lived up in Bangor" who writes books "full of make-believe monsters and a bunch of dirty words"." This is lampshaded in _Misery_, in which writer Paul Sheldon has trouble starting a new book without his concordance.
    -   There are a handful of novels King has written that seem to be separate from the main universe he has established— namely, _Cell_ and pretty much anything he wrote as Richard Bachman, though their taking place in parallel dimensions of the same multiverse has not been ruled out (this has a precedent in _The Stand_, which is confirmed to be a seperate Earth from the Prime Reality yet still part of its multiverse, since Roland and his ka-tet briefly visit it in their own series).
-   The Strugatsky Brothers' Noon Universe.
-   Ursula K. Le Guin's works:
    -   Earthsea, a fantasy world that is the setting for _The Earthsea Trilogy_ (_A Wizard of Earthsea_, _The Tombs of Atuan_ and _The Farthest Shore_), as well as _Tehanu_, _The Other Wind_, _Tales from Earthsea_ and the short stories which introduced Earthsea, _The Rule of Names_ and _The Word of Unbinding_.
    -   The _Hainish_ universe, a.k.a. the Ekumen. A science fiction setting featuring many populated planets, that is the setting for many novels and short stories. Among the more well-known are _The Dispossessed_, _The Left Hand of Darkness_ and _The Word for World is Forest_, though there are many others. A few works, such as _The Eye of the Heron_, may or may not be set in this universe.
-   Older Than Television: William Faulkner set most of his works in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County and often crossed over characters.
-   The Sprawl in William Gibson's first trilogy plus two short stories.

### **By Title:**

-   While the Cthulhu Mythos is generally defined as an Expanded Universe, the "mythos proper", the elements that H. P. Lovecraft himself wrote about (usually set in Lovecraft Country), constitute a 'verse within the 'verse. Other writers have their own 'cycles' within it. Lovecraft himself never much cared about continuity or consistency, and deliberately sought to invoke the feeling of ancient mythology with his mutually inconsistent explanations — if mythology from thousands of years ago is a mess open to a wide variety of interpretations, then how would mythology several _billion_ years old develop?
-   Deltora, the setting of the three Deltora Quest series, and various spinoffs such as _The Deltora Book of Monsters_.
-   Jim Butcher's urban fantasy series of books, _The Dresden Files_, is commonly referred to by fans as the Dresdenverse. So is the TV series of the same name (also referred to as "TV-verse"). Incorporating elements from both the books and the TV series in fanfic is referred to as "comboverse." It turned into an Ascended Meme in the tabletop RPG. Considering the Breaking the Fourth Wall and Direct Line to the Author stuff going on with the RPG rulebooks, this means one of the characters is referring to _his own universe_ that way, which the titular Harry Dresden finds really weird.
-   The Duniverse, setting of _Dune_ and its sequels.
-   The Enderverse is the Trope Namer, although technically the creator wishes it never was (see the summary of the trope above). It includes _Ender's Game_, the _Speaker for the Dead_ trilogy, the _Ender's Shadow_ side series, and _Ender in Exile_, as well as a number of short stories and comics. It is far from the first example, however.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, which is more like a multi-media set of alternate continuities. This is lampshaded in _Mostly Harmless_, which explains away all the different continuities by talking about how the universe is just one path through 'The Whole Sort of General Mish Mash', constantly changing position. A similar solution was used by _Discworld_ in _Thief of Time_.
-   The setting of David Weber's _Honor Harrington_ series and its various spinoffs is commonly referred to as the Honorverse.
-   The _Humanx Commonwealth_, Alan Dean Foster's best known Space Opera setting and home to the Flinx and Pip series of novels.
-   The various serial novels of Less Than Three Comics are all based in the <3-Verse.
-   The Riordanverse, by Rick Riordan, encompasses _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_, _The Kane Chronicles_, _The Heroes of Olympus_, _Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard_, and _The Trials of Apollo_. _Percy Jackson_, _Heroes of Olympus_, and _Trials of Apollo_ are all part of what's called _The Camp Half-Blood Series_ (with _Kane Chronicles_ and _Magnus Chase_ sometimes being under that umbrella too, maybe).
    -   By internal timeline: _The Diary of Luke Castellan_ is a prequel set seven years before _The Lightning Thief_ (_Percy Jackson_ #1). The first five _Percy Jackson_ books are set over the course of four years, with books 1, 2, 4, and 5 set over consecutive summers; the third book is set the winter after the second. The short stories of _The Demigod Files_ are set between books 4 and 5, with _The Bronze Dragon_ taking place during the ending of the fourth book, _The Stolen Chariot_ taking place during Percy's fall semester, and _The Sword of Hades_ beginning during Percy's English winter final exam. The short story _Percy Jackson and the Staff of Hermes_ takes place a month after _The Last Olympian_ (_Percy Jackson_ #5), and _Percy Jackson and the Singer of Apollo_ and _Son of Magic_ (by Rick Riordan's son Haley Riordan) take place sometime after _The Last Olympian_. _The Lost Hero_ (_Heroes of Olympus_ #1) is set the following December, and _The Red Pyramid_ (_Kane Chronicles_ #1) picks up just days later.
    -   The short story _Leo Valdez and the Quest for Buford_ is set the following February, and _The Throne of Fire_ (_Kane Chronicles_ #2) is set the following March. The remaining four books of _The Heroes of Olympus_ take place from June to August of the same year. _The Serpent's Shadow_ (_Kane Chronicles_ #3) is in September. The three-part crossover _Demigods & Magicians_, in which Percy and Annabeth meet the Kane siblings, is set after this, followed by _The Chalice of the Gods_ (_Percy Jackson_ #6).
    -   _Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard_ #1 (with the titular lead being Annabeth's cousin, a demigod son of Frey) and _The Trials of Apollo_ #1 are both set in January of the following year, with #4 of _The Trials of Apollo_ set in April. Book #3 of the _Magnus Chase_ trilogy takes place the following June, at the same time as _The Trials of Apollo_ #5; the epilogue of _Magnus Chase_ #3 takes place in early July, and the followup _9 From the Nine Worlds_ is set sometime later.
-   Tortall, home to (so far) _Song of the Lioness_, _The Immortals_, _Protector of the Small_, the _Trickster's Duet_, and _Beka Cooper_ quartet/quartet/quartet/duology/trilogy.
    -   The _Circleverse_, home to _Circle of Magic_, _The Circle Opens_, _The Will of the Empress_, _Melting Stones_ and _Battle Magic_ quartet/quartet/books. Ole' Tammy likes her quartets, she does.
-   Lois McMaster Bujold's _Vorkosigan Saga_ is also referred to as the Vorkosiverse.
-   _Warrior Cats_: The main series is fairly straightforward, but the Expanded Universe books are made up of several "sagas" that cover completely different parts of the world with a handful of intersecting characters.

    Live-Action TV 

### **By Creator:**

-   ABC:
    -   Soap operas _All My Children_, _One Life to Live_, and _General Hospital_, as well as the cancelled _Port Charles_, have one universe complete with canon immigrants and crossover storylines.
    -   ABC also did this with their mid-90s sitcoms, courtesy of a Las Vegas-set Crossover linking _The Drew Carey Show_, _Coach_, _Ellen_, and _Grace Under Fire_.
-   The CBS-verse, which consists of _The Bob Newhart Show_, _Murphy Brown_, _The Famous Teddy Z_, _High Society_, _Ink_, _Love And War_, _The Nanny_, _Can't Hurry Love_, _Everybody Loves Raymond_, _The King of Queens_, _Becker_, and _Cosby_.
    -   _The Beverly Hillbillies_, _Petticoat Junction_, and _Green Acres_ were established to exist in the same universe. The latter two were even in the same _town_, although interaction between the casts was limited to general store owner Mr. Drucker (a regular on both series) and the occasional cameo.
-   In the Disney Channel Live-Action Universe, the following shows have been established, through numerous crossovers, to exist in the same universe:
    -   _That's So Raven_ - The oldest. Forms the first piece of _That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana_, the first crossover.
    -   _Cory in the House_ - A spinoff of _That's So Raven_, with a few characters from said show (including Raven herself) making guest appearances. Has a crossover with _Hannah Montana_ in the episode, "Take This Job and Love It", the second crossover.
    -   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_ - Forms the centerpiece of _That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana_.
    -   _The Suite Life on Deck_ - A spinoff of _The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody_, in which a number of characters from said show make guest appearances and, like its parent show, forms the centerpiece of _Wizards On Deck with Hannah Montana_, the third crossover.
    -   _Hannah Montana_ - Forms the last piece of both _That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana_ and _Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana_.
    -   _Wizards of Waverly Place_ - Forms the first piece of _Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana_.
    -   _Aaron Stone_ - The game Hero Rising appears in the _Good Luck Charlie_ episode _Let's Potty_.
    -   _I'm in the Band_ - Has a crossover with _The Suite Life on Deck_ in the episode, _Weasels on Deck_, the fourth crossover.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   _Good Luck Charlie_ - Has direct crossovers with _Shake it Up_ and _Jessie_.
    -   _Shake it Up_ - The episode _Judge It Up_ features the fictional TV program _Teen Court_, which is also featured in the _Hannah Montana_ episode _You are Sue-able to Me_.
    -   _A.N.T. Farm_ - One episode mentions the Hashimoto soda brand from _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. Another episode shows a poster for Tears of Blood, which is a band in_ Wizards of Waverly Place''.
    -   _Jessie_ - Has a crossover with _Austin & Ally_ in the hour long special _Austin & Jessie & Ally All Star New Year. Later on it has a crossover with_ Good Luck Charlie _in another hour long special_ Good Luck Jessie: NYC Christmas''.
    -   _Austin & Ally_ - Has an hour long crossover special with _Jessie_.
    -   _Liv and Maddie_ - In the episode _Steal-A-Rooney_, Joey buys a Z-Phone, which is a fictional product from _A.N.T. Farm_.
    -   Since Selena Gomez shows up as herself on an episode of _Sonny with a Chance_, it's possible that either every show above is a fictional show in the _Sonny with a Chance_ universe or _Sonny with a Chance_ isn't connected to the other universe at all.
    -   Another odd thing is that Selena Gomez has a character on Hannah Montana as Hannah's rival and a completely different character in _Wizards of Waverly Place_.
-   The two series by Hart Hanson, _Bones_ and _The Finder_, share a 'verse.
-   J. J. Abrams' "Abramsverse", for the lack of a better word, has so far been shown to be one of the most expansive verses on television. Shows which are more or less found in this verse are _Alias_, _Lost_, _Fringe_, _Person of Interest_. Common things found throughout most of these: the Slusho beverage brand, Apollo candy bars, the Dharma Initiative, Oceanic Airlines, Massive Dynamic, the band Drive Shaft (which Charlie from _Lost_ was a member of), and some very mild character references and crossovers. Some of his movies are non-canonically connected by some Fanon there as well (see film section).
    -   _Fringe_ also happens in the same universe as _Twin Peaks_ as Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, Laura Palmer's former psychiatrist, is mentioned to be an old friend of Walter Bishop and gave him his glasses. If _Fringe_ is part of a major Abramsverse as is the common believe then _Twin Peaks_ is also part of the Abramsverse.
    -   Also Oceanic Airlines exists in the _The X-Files_, _Fast Forward_ and _Up All Night_ placing them all in the same universe, and as the _The X-Files_ also shares universe with _Millennium (1996)_ and _The Lone Gunmen_ those are also part of the Abramsverse. And the Lariat Rental Cars is mentioned to exist both in _The X-Files_ and _Veronica Mars_.
    -   Slusho also exists in _Heroes_.
-   NBC's '80s sitcoms _The Golden Girls_, _Empty Nest_ and _Nurses_ all share the same universe. By extension, the CBS series _Golden Palace_ is also in that universe.
-   _Saved by the Bell_ and many of the other shows created by Peter Engel share a universe. Apart from the two direct spin-off shows (_Saved by the Bell: The College Years_ and _Saved by the Bell: The New Class_), _California Dreams_ is also connected via the recurring character of Stingray on both _Dreams_ and _The College Years_. _Hang Time_ is a little trickier to place. While it did have a crossover with _The New Class_ which was brought up in both shows it has also referenced _Saved By the Bell_ as a fictional show within the _Hang Time_ universe and featured Dustin Diamond as both himself and his _Saved By the Bell_ character Screech in different episodes.
-   _Toei Universe_ - Toei Productions has promoted its expanded universe with _Super Sentai_, _Kamen Rider_ and other Tokusatsu shows under their belt.
    -   _Kamen Rider Decade_ and _Samurai Sentai Shinkenger_ have Intercontinuity Crossover episodes with each other.
    -   _OOO, Den-O, All Riders: Let's Go Kamen Riders_ has Kikaider, Kikaider01, Inazuman and Zubat make a cameo appearance.
    -   _Super Hero Taisen_ has a crossover between _Super Sentai_ and the _Kamen Rider_ franchises, and _Kamen Rider × Super Sentai × Space Sheriff: Super Hero Taisen Z_ adds the _Metal Heroes_ franchise with _Space Sheriff Gavan_, _Space Sheriff Sharivan_ and _Space Sheriff Shaider_.
    -   During the Showa era, writer Shozo Uehara likes to have his characters existing in a Verse.
        -   _Himitsu Sentai Gorenger VS J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai_ mentions Kamen Rider V3, Kamen Rider Amazon and Kikaider as heroes fighting the evil organization Crime in different parts of the globe.
        -   _Denshi Sentai Denziman_ and _Taiyou Sentai Sun Vulcan_ are established to be of the same continuity with _Denziman_ main villain Queen Hedrian returning in _Sun Vulcan_. The backstory of space criminal Inazuma Ginga Production Foreshadowing _Space Sheriff Gavan_ mentioning the Galactic Union Police and the Galactic Union.
    -   _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_ main writer Naruhisa Arakawa establishes within the _Gokaiger_ episodes and movies a Space Police Verse with _Space Sheriff Gavan_, Signalman of _Gekisou Sentai Carranger_, and _Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger_. Conveniently using per-established trivia. _Sun Vulcan_ production-foreshadowed _Gavan_ and the Space Police was mentioned in episode 27 of _Space Sheriff Sharivan_. Signalman, a _Metal Hero_ parody by Naruhisa Arakawa, is a Space Police from Planet Police. Naruhisa Arakawa was the head writer of _Dekaranger_, Dekarangers are called Space Police by Alienizers.
        -   In episode 4 Marvelous calls SPD the Space Police.
        -   _Gokaiger Goseiger Super Sentai 199 Hero Great Battle_ pamphlet mentions Doggie Kruger and Gavan as friends.
        -   _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger vs. Space Sheriff Gavan: The Movie_ mentions the Dekarangers clearing the Gokaigers of piracy thus a Space Sheriff of the Space Police should not arrest them. Weaval Director General of the Space Police wears a cap with an emblem of the Galactic Union Police and wears a SPD commander buckle.
        -   In the _Gokaiger_ epilogue; Doggie Kruger and Signalman salute the Gokai Galleon passing by.
-   All of the original dramas on the USA Network, at least in the various commercials.

### **By Title:**

-   The Arrowverse is The CW's adaptation of DC Comics properties, comprising _Arrow_, _The Flash_, _Legends of Tomorrow_, and _Supergirl_, along with a few web series. _Constantine_, which aired on NBC, was retroactively inserted into this universe after the show was canceled.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   It also includes the 1990's _The Flash_, which also takes place in alternate timeline (although not the same one as _Supergirl_).

-   _CASUAL+Y_, _Holby City_ and _Holby Blue_ take place in the same universe.
-   _Cheers_, _The Torlellis_, _Wings_, and _Frasier_ all share the same universe. the first, second, and last are the most obvious as _The Tortellis_ and _Frasier_ are both spin-offs of _Cheers_
-   _Crossing Jordan_ and _Las Vegas_ already shared the same universe thanks to Jerry O'Connell's character appearing in both, however the existence of the Montecito Hotel in both shows and also in _Heroes_, _Medium_, _Passions_, _Knight Rider_, _The Office (US)_ and most notably _Star Gate Atlantis_ which would connect all these shows with the Stargate-verse.
-   The _Firefly_ 'verse (series and movie _Serenity_). (Notable for the fact that the characters refer to their own universe as "the 'Verse"). The terms "Jossverse", "Whedonverse" and "ME-verse" (ME = Mutant Enemy, Joss Whedon's production company) have been used to refer to both this and the Buffyverse; while there is no connection between the two in canon, it's a Common Crossover for fans due to the similar styles of both.
-   _H₂O: Just Add Water_ and _Mako Mermaids: An H₂O Adventure_ both exist in what could be called the H2Overse, the mermaid-centric universe created by Jonathan M. Shiff. The books may also constitute an Expanded Universe.
-   The _Happy Days_ universe includes itself (but not necessarily its parent show _Love, American Style_) _Laverne & Shirley_, _Mork & Mindy_, _Joanie Loves Chachi_ and the short lived _Blanksie's Beauties_ and _Out of the Blue_. This means that angels, time travel and aliens all exist in the same universe as the Fonz and Ralph Malph.

    -   _Law & Order_ (aka The Mothership)
    -   _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_
    -   _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_
    -   _Law & Order: Trial by Jury_
    -   _Conviction_
    -   _Deadline_
    -   _Law & Order: Crime and Punishment_
    -   _In Plain Sight_ (via a Crossover with _Criminal Intent_)
    -   _Homicide: Life on the Street_
    -   _New York Undercover_
    -   Various international versions
    -   John Munch is pretty much a universe of his own. This potentially includes (of all things) _The X-Files_, _Arrested Development_, _The Wire_, and _Sesame Street_ (yes, really) in the Law & Order Verse.
    -   Eventually it becomes a snowball effect. One doctor from _St. Elsewhere_ showed up years later on _Homicide_, and then another doctor from _St. Elsewhere_ showed up in the _Homicide_ movie. Carla, Norm, and Cliff from _Cheers_ appeared on an episode of _St. Elsewhere_. Frasier and Lilith from _Cheers_ and _Frasier_ also appeared on _Wings_.
    -   _Chicago P.D._ and _Chicago Fire_ are also now included in this universe, with two separate three-part crossovers with _SVU_. This by itself constitutes its own 'verse, with new additions _Chicago Med_ and _Chicago Justice_.
    -   Hailey Upton's appearance on _FBI_ established that _FBI_, _FBI: Most Wanted_, and _FBI: International_ exist in the _One Chicago_ universe, and by extension the _Law & Order_ universe.
-   It is established early on that _Mad About You_ and _Friends_ share the same universe. Due to Crossovers, the universe also includes _Caroline in the City_, and _The Single Guy_. _Seinfeld_ is in the same universe too, as Kramer makes a cameo once in _Mad About You_ as apparently he is sub-renting Paul's old bachelor's apartment. Paul even ask him if the guy next door is still a comedian.
-   The CBC programs _Murdoch Mysteries_, _Republic of Doyle_, and _Frankie Drake Mysteries_ share a universe.
-   _The Noddy Shop_ episode "Kate Loves A Parade" mentions a location from _Shining Time Station_, meaning that both shows possibly take place in the same universe, or at least in neighboring towns.
-   _The Office_ and _Parks and Recreation_ were intended to be set in one universe, but this idea was dropped. The original UK version of _The Office_ is still part of the same universe, though, judging by Ricky Gervais's cameo as David Brent.
-   What can be call the "Bellisarioverse" is linked when Sam Beckett of _Quantum Leap_ mentions to Al that his sister is married to Jim Bonnick, a naval officer who appears in Bellisario's _Magnum, P.I._ and also in _Hawaii Five-O_, _Murder, She Wrote_ and _Simon & Simon_ placing them all the same universe. Also in _Sliders_ Captain Maggie Becket mentions that she has an uncle named Sam.
-   The presence of the One-Niners gang establishes that _The Shield_ and _Sons of Anarchy_ share a universe.
-   The character Guido Panzini appears in _The Steve Allen Show_, _The Jack Paar Show_, _McHale's Navy_, _The Man from U.N.C.L.E._ and _One Day at a Time (1975)_
-   _St. Elsewhere_: The Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis looks at all of the shows that _St. Elsewhere_ had crossovers with, all the shows that _those_ shows had crossovers with, the shows spun off from those shows, shows that homaged shows in the Tommy Westphall Universe in such a way that connections could be drawn, and so on in order to claim that a large swath of modern television exists in the same universe... and since _St. Elsewhere_ famously ended with an All Just a Dream Gainax Ending, all of these shows are products of the imagination of an autistic boy. The idea was created by Dwayne McDuffie in 2002, ironically as a tongue-in-cheek criticism of how seriously fans of comic books take continuity. Cornell University scholar Brian Weatherson published a rebuttal to the hypothesis, "Six Objections to the Westphall Hypothesis," which among other things argues that even if the entire _St. Elsewhere_ universe is in Tommy's mind, characters from other shows that appear on _St. Elsewhere_ do not necessary exist only in Tommy's mind, as he could have put them in there after watching their respective shows.
-   _Ultra Series_ has quite a few 'verses. There's the main Showa verse - often called the Nebula M78 verse, which is where all the Showa series takes place as well as _Ultraman Mebius_ and possibly _Ultraman Geed_ (according to Word of God), and many of the movies. Other shows have their own continuity but many characters are shared from 'verse to 'verse and cross-overs in movies are pretty frequent.
-   _The Walking Dead_ starts as just a straight adaptation of the comic series, following Rick Grimes and his group of survivors, as they start in the area outside Atlanta and eventually make their way to outside Washington DC. Later on, it develops spinoffs — _Fear the Walking Dead_ and _The Walking Dead: World Beyond_ so far, with more planned — which follow different survivors in other parts of the country, expanding on the universe as a whole.
-   Crossover episodes between _Warehouse 13_ and _Eureka_, in which Fargo visits the Warehouse and Claudia visits Eureka, place the two shows in the same universe.
    -   Lindsay Wagner's _Warehouse 13_ character Dr. Vanessa Calder appears in the _Alphas_ episode "Never Let Me Go" bringing that show into this universe as well.
-   The Whoniverse, comprising _Doctor Who_, _Torchwood_, _The Sarah Jane Adventures_, _Big Finish Doctor Who_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and _Class_. It's also got a massive Expanded Universe.
-   _The X-Files_, _Millennium (1996)_, and _The Lone Gunmen_ all exist in the same universe. The first and last are the most obvious, with the Lone Gunmen being an _X-Files_ spin-off, though characters go back and forth between all three series and there is at least one cross-over episode.
    -   Also in episode "Milagro" of _The X-Files_ the gravestones of Nicholas and Diana Salinger can be seen in a cemetery. Those are the parents of the siblings in _Party of Five_ situating them in the same universe.

    Magazine 

-   _Analog_: In the May 1941 issue, "History to Come" describes John Campbell's opinion on how developing a consistent world history is important for Science Fiction, using Robert A. Heinlein's _History Of Tomorrow_ as an example of why other authors should do the same sort of Worldbuilding to build connected stories. An analysis of Heinlein's 'verse appears on pages 123 through 125, part of the "Brass Tacks" column.

     Music 

-   The BTS Universe is an on-going original story comprised mainly of a series of Concept Music Videos of Korean group BTS (plus video teasers/short films and additional content in other media). The storyline is closely linked to the general narrative and themes present in BTS' music, which in itself contains a Coming of Age Story: themes such as the beauty and struggles of youth (Hwa Yang Yeon Hwa), facing temptation and inner conflict (WINGS) and the idea of trying and failing to love and be loved while hiding under a mask (LOVE YOURSELF) translate into the characters dealing with school and societal pressures, poverty, family and mental health issues, fear of the future, maturity, regret, and so on.
-   The Korean girl group GFRIEND's music videos have an underlying story built since their debut to this day, following them over the years. A Coming of Age Story by essence. It goes from a school series to a fantastic narrative. The main plot revolves around the friendship of a group of girls while they grow up and have to deal with loss, their friendship falling apart as they struggle to be together.
-   The music videos for the K-Pop Girl Group LOONA are all connected within a universe called the Loonaverse, telling a story featuring all the members. It seems to involve at least three different worlds, one being very similar to Earth (where YeoJin and the LOONA 1/3 girls live), a world named Eden (from where the LOONA/yyxy girls try to escape) and some sort of boundary dimension between both worlds (where the LOONA/ODD EYE CIRCLE girls are).
-   The K-Pop group TXT has started its own musical narrative universe, the TU (stylized as +U) with the release of the Nap of a Star MV.
-   Many Country Music songs written by Dennis Linde are said to take place in a shared universe, and Linde even kept a map in his office indicating the residence of every character in his songs. Most notably, the eponymous Earl of Dixie Chicks' "Goodbye Earl" previously appeared in Sammy Kershaw's "Queen of My Double Wide Trailer".
-   The Alternative Country band Turnpike Troubadours have several songs (across different albums) that are connected through a boy named Jimmy, a girl named Lorrie, and a beloved Browning shotgun. There's a fan theory tying in a number of their other songs, but it hasn't been confirmed by the band.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F created and sanctions the Mexican National Wrestling Championship Title Belts, most famously but not exclusively defended in CMLL. CMLL was also a member of the National Wrestling Alliance and created 'NWA Historic' title belts after leaving to retain that NWA history. It remained the biggest affiliate of the World Wrestling League in Mexico even when WWL established it's own Mexican headquarters. It runs joint events with New Japan Pro-Wrestling and has joint titles with REINA.
-   The World Women's Wrestling Association, The American Girls' Wrestling Association, All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling and Stampeded Wrestling in Canada all recognized one another. In addition, Stampede also had the IWA Women's title.
-   Dragon Gate USA, EVOLVE, Full Impact Pro, and SHINE. This isn't the first time Gabe Sapolsky put the promotions he books inside the same universe; he did it with Ring of Honor and Full Impact Pro (until ROH broke off from the WWN in 2009).
-   Chikara Pro and its "Wrestling Is" derivatives. (Wrestling Is Fun, Wrestling Is Art, etc). Briefly had a Kiyuko Pro but it did not last and recognized Kaiju Big Battel, which did last but rarely crosses over with Chikara anymore.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ features not just multiple universes (called Campaign Settings) but multiple _cosmologies_ tying them together; still, the potential for crossover is there (in one of the video games, for example, a group of knights from _Dragonlance_ end up trapped in the _Forgotten Realms_, while numerous references to the _Planescape_ setting are made).
    -   In fact, part of _Planescape_'s purpose seems to be not just to allow such crossovers, but to say that stranger things can and indeed do happen every day on the planes.
    -   The _Spelljammer_ setting had characters from one world traveling to others in "spaceships."
    -   _Ravenloft_ had characters from different settings finding themselves in its D&D world.
-   In the _Old World of Darkness_, all the gamelines theoretically take place in the same universes, occasionally making references to monsters and concepts in other game lines within the verse. This is also true in the _New World of Darkness_, but is given less emphasis between gamelines.
-   The _Rifts_ Megaverse is a collection of universes consisting of Rifts' Earth, the living planet known as _Wormwood_, the Space Opera _Three Galaxies_ universe, as well as Earths for each of Palladium's other games, such as the Palladium World (High Fantasy), _Heroes Unlimited_ (Superheroes), and _Nightbane_.
    -   By implication, this also includes the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage) and Robotech universes, since Palladium at one point held those licenses - since they no longer have them, Writing Around Trademarks takes place on the rare occasions these games are acknowledged.
-   The Third Imperium background to the science-fiction role-playing game _Traveller_.
-   The Trinity Universe comprises 1920s pulp game _Adventure_, near-future supers game _Aberrant_, and 22nd century sci-fi game _Trinity_.

    Video Games 

### **By Creator:**

-   Bandai Namco Entertainment:
    -   It's hard to determine just how vast the "Banpresto Multiverse" is, but by using _Super Robot Wars: Original Generation_ as its centerpiece, then the events that tie in with _Original Generation_ include the "Classic Timeline", _The Great Battle_ series, _Hero Senki: Project Olympus_, _Super Robot Wars Alpha_, _Super Hero Sakusen_, _Super Robot Wars Reversal_, _Another Century's Episode: R_ and _Endless Frontier_. Furthermore, this extends into _Namco × Capcom_ and _Project × Zone_, as _Endless Frontier_ occurs between both games. Needless to say, The Multiverse churned out by Namco is extraordinarily big. _Super Robot Wars 30_ would later cause a Crisis Crossover when the separation of the universes, known as Karmic Horizons, are easily exploited by the powers of the Magine, machines and beings, i.e. The Mazins, The Getters, The Rune Gods, Gridman and Psycho-frame equippped Gundams, that use Heroic Spirit and Villainous Valour to crate miracles.
    -   Namco also has the **United Galaxy Space Force** series, which involves many of their classic shooter games like _Galaxian_, _Bosconian_, _Burning Force_, _Galaga_, _Starblade_, and even outside games like _Cyber Sled_, _Ridge Racer_ and the entire _Dig Dug_/_Mr. Driller_ series. It should be noted that the timeline and release order are in no way aligned. The first game in the series, chronologically, is _Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere_, with _Galaxian_ taking place a good two hundred years afterwards.
-   According to Hideki Kamiya, all of his games are set in the same universe. There are certainly cross-game references (Enzo from the manual _Devil May Cry_ is featured in its Spiritual Successor _Bayonetta_, Wonder Cheerleader and Sexy Silvia are the same character etc.) However, as his creations are currently owned by multiple different companies, it's unlikely these cross-game references will lead to any grander crossover anytime soon.
-   id Software's 90s games form a loose universe. _Quake III: Arena_ tied together _Quake II, Quake_, and _Doom_ by bringing together the three protagonists. _Doom RPG_ and _Wolfenstein RPG_ retconned in _Wolfenstein 3-D_ by having BJ fight a pre-cyborg Cyberdemon and implying that he is Doomguy's ancestor; this also brought in _Commander Keen_, who was already established to be BJ's grandson.
-   The Irem arcade games _In the Hunt_, _Undercover Cops_, _Air Duel_ and _Gunforce 2_ all takes place in the same post-apocalyptic universe and feature the D.A.S as the bad guys.
-   While it yet lacks an official identifier, the universe by Project Moon that appears in all of their games (_Lobotomy Corporation_, _Library of Ruina_, _Limbus Company_) is often colloquially called the 'Project Moon-verse'.
-   Remedy Entertainment have established most of their titles to be within their Remedy Connected Universe, including the _Alan Wake_ games and _Control_. Small hints point to a larger multiverse which indirectly includes their _Max Payne_ series and _Quantum Break_.
-   While at first, Sierra On-Line's _Laura Bow_ and _Gabriel Knight_ series have similar elements, with both being detectives from Tulane University, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it flyer on a message board in _Gabriel Knight_ links the two series together, as an elderly Laura is giving a lecture on investigative journalism at a future date. It's actually quite a shame the two never get a chance to meet up.
-   The Tom Clancy games by Ubisoft (_Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, EndWar_ and _H.A.W.X._) all inhabit the same continuity (though Continuity Snarl has crept in over the years, e.g. _HAWX 2_ and _Ghost Recon: Future Soldier_ depict wildly different versions of the same conflict, _Rainbow Six Siege_ doesn't seem big on acknowledging anything else from the verse other than the existence of Sam Fisher, and _EndWar_ has been all but banished from the continuity).
-   Valve's two series _Half-Life_ and _Portal_ almost certainly inhabit the same continuity.

### **By Title:**

-   Oddly enough, a subversion, inversion, or straight play in a video game, depending on who you ask: _Aquaria_. In fact, whether or not the Verse is the world around the main character eventually plays something of a major point in the plot. Not really a fandom trope, so much as a nice twist of words, though sooner or later there's bound to be Fan Fic...
-   "Bluehills County Stories" is the official name of a collection of games and visual novels created by Digital Poppy taking place in the titular setting. This collection includes _Parsnip_, _The Testimony of Trixie Glimmer Smith_, and _Three Lesbians in a Barrow_.
-   Nippon Ichi's games such as _Disgaea_ all take place in one Universe, one that you actually explore and learn more about in _Makai Kingdom_ and also includes non-demon worlds such as the one seen in _La Pucelle_. To go into detail, virtually every series made by Nippon ichi falls into two distinct verses: The world of Atelier, and the Netherworlds, which are a combination of Marl kingdom, La Pucelle, Disgaea, Phantom Brave, Makai Kingdom, Soul Nomad, and several others that were not even known to be in correlation including a few cancelled videogames with characters who cross into other games. Not only are these games taking place within the same universe, but most characters find it perfectly natural for everyone to just randomly go to and fro between series as either cameo shots, secondary characters, or main characters, and often reference these fourth wall breaking aspects regularly. One character in particular, Overlord Baal, frequently makes his appearance as the Superboss of any Nippon Ichi game involving a netherworld, and everyone knows who he is.
-   The _Donkey Kong_, _Yoshi_, Wario and _Super Mario Bros._ series' are all in the same universe and many of the Mario spin-offs tend to feature characters and locations from them. Mario and DK started off as enemies after all and DK still shows up in Mario spin off games and vice-versa, same goes with Wario. Back in The '90s, it was implied that _Banjo-Kazooie_ and _Conker's Bad Fur Day_ also shared this universe (chiefly because of Banjo and Conker being playable racers in _Diddy Kong Racing_, among other hints) but Microsoft's purchase of Rareware caused this to no longer be the case. Lastly, _Rhythm Heaven_ is also implied to inhabit this universe as well due to the many references and crossovers between it and the WarioWare franchise.
-   _Ivalice Alliance_:
    -   _Final Fantasy XII_, its sequel _Revenant Wings_, _Final Fantasy Tactics_, _Final Fantasy Tactics Advance_ and _Final Fantasy Tactics A2_ all take place within the world of Ivalice, as might _Vagrant Story_.
    -   "The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII".
    -   _Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy_ project, which encompasses _Final Fantasy XIII_ _Final Fantasy XIII\-2_ and _Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII_ These examples (and many others) were later quantified as many universes all being connected to one another in _Dissidia Final Fantasy_, all thanks to a dimensional bridge that called the Interdimensional Rift, first introduced in _Final Fantasy V_.
-   For a long time, the interconnection of the games in the _The Legend of Zelda_ series was hotly debated in the fandom, before finally being settled in the _Hyrule Historia_ encylopedia. It shows that the games up to _Ocarina of Time_ were in one continuity, at which point it split into three separate timelines that (so far) have not overlapped. Also, as far as the Zeldaverse is concerned, there were never any games on the Philips CDi.
-   The laws of physics and various cultures depicted in the _Myst_ games and books is often called the D'niverse (pronounced done-ni-verse) after the most prominent race in the storyline. Technically, it's actually a multiverse, connecting smaller universes called Ages...
-   Atlus confirmed in this interview that the _Persona_ games all take place in the same world, though the only things consistent throughout _all_ of the entries (apart from the titular Personas) are Igor, the Velvet Room, and Philemon's butterfly form. Several characters and plot elements from the original _Persona_ show up in _Persona 2_, and _Persona 4: Arena_ and its sequel _Ultimax_ are nearly as much sequels to _Persona 3_ as they are to _Persona 4_, but the connections between the games are otherwise kept fairly low-key and incidental (aside from _Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth_, which the casts involved end up forgetting about anyways). _Persona 5_ meanwhile references various characters from the previous games through tv shows, ads and the occasional NPC conversation.
    -   All _Persona_ games are in fact a spin off from _Shin Megami Tensei if..._ given the player character of that game, Tamaki Uchida, appears in both _Persona 1_ and the _2_ duology. _If_ also shares its world with the _Devil Summoner_ sub series, which both have a premise of the events of _Shin Megami Tensei I_ not happening, as _Devil Summoner_ reveals both parties responsible for the apocalyptic events have been rendered unable to do so. In fact, _Persona 2_ has Tamaki working for the Kuzunoha detective agency, a primary institution of _Devil summoner_ with the current titular Kuzunoha implying to be posessing Daisuke Todoroki, referencing his role in the original _Devil Summoner_ game. Thus, all three verses are connected, though the fate of the original _Shin Megami Tensei_ heroes are never revealed due to them never encountering the apocalypse.
    -   _Catherine_ might be a part of this universe as well, since Vincent makes an appearance in _Persona 3 Portable_. Though a twist in _Catherine_ is that the game seems to take place in the future.
-   The main _Pokémon_ games take place in different regions of the same world. This becomes obvious with the presence of two regions in _Gold_, _Silver_, and _Crystal_ and references to regions of past games in later games. All of the first four generations are actually in different regions of the same _country_, the equivalent of Japan in that universe. Starting from _Pokémon Black and White_ with the debut of the Unova region, the series moves to a different country, apparently based on the United States of America.
-   _The Sims_ series, the _SimCity_ series, _Streets of SimCity_, _SimCopter_ and _SimGolf_, all share the same universe. Other _Sim Series_ titles are more ambiguous.
-   The _Street Fighter_ universe is surprisingly malleable, with how many franchises share the same world. There's the series itself, _Final Fight_ (as of _Street Fighter Alpha_), _Saturday Night Slam Masters_ (due to the _Final Fight_ connection), _Captain Commando_, _Rival Schools_, _Strider_ (as of _Street Fighter V_), and _Tekken_ if Akuma being in 7 is any indication (likewise, that also adds in _Street Fighter X Tekken_, as well as every franchise featured in _Namco × Capcom_ and _Project × Zone_).
-   The _Super Smash Bros.._ Universe includes all the Nintendo series as fictional video games, and is in some way related to the Real Life Universe through Master Hand (possibly Crazy Hand as well).
-   _Take On Helicopters_ has some crossover with _ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead_ (the standalone expansion for _ARMA II_), in the form of one of the main characters having been a combat pilot during the events of _Operation Arrowhead_, along with appearances by the PMCs Vrana and ION from one of _OA_s DLC campaigns.
-   There's two distinct 'verses in the _Tales Series_. The "Destiny" 'verse contains _Tales of Destiny_ and its direct sequel, _Tales of Destiny 2_ (though not _Tales of Eternia_). The "Aseria" 'verse contains _Tales of Phantasia_, _Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon_, _Tales of Phantasia: Summoner's Lineage_, _Tales of Symphonia_, and _Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World_.
    -   There is now a third with the existence of _Tales of Xillia_ 1 and 2, and a fourth with the games _Tales of Zestiria_ and _Tales of Berseria_.

    Visual Novels 

-   Christine Love's visual novels are all subtly linked by the existence of Amie Computers, Lake City, the Rook and Yamazaki families, and Artificial Intelligences with names that start with asterisks. There are some other continuity nods, but those are the main ones.
-   Key/Visual Arts's Season verse of _Kanon_, _Air_, and _CLANNAD_.
-   _When They Cry_: There's multiple hints in _Umineko: When They Cry_ that imply it takes place in the same megaverse as _Higurashi: When They Cry_. The most obvious connection is that the witch Bernkastel is all but directly stated to be a Literal Split Personality of Rika Furude.

    Webcomics 

-   The Bobbinsverse has the three major works of John Allison, _Bobbins_, _Scary Go Round_ and _Bad Machinery_ are all set in the fictional English town of Tackleford, sharing many cast members with each other. Not to forget secondary Spin Offs such as _Murder She Writes_, _THAT_, _Giant Days_ and _New Bobbins_.
-   _Charby the Vampirate_, _Here There Be Monsters_, _A Bird in the Hat_ and _Unlife Is Unfair_ are all written by the same author and occupy the same verse, though Unlife seems disconnected the Patreon reward comic _Vagabonds_ reveals some overlap.
-   All of _Homestuck_, and possibly the rest of _MSPA_, takes place in what is known as Paradox Space.
-   All webcomics in the _International Comic Continuity_ take place in what is affectionately referred to as the ICCverse.
-   _MegaTokyo_, _Mac Hall_, and _Applegeeks_ apparently inhabit the same universe, as crossovers have happened several times. This is especially apparent with Megatokyo and Applegeeks, where regular characters Junpei and a Rent-a-Zilla from Megatokyo played a major role in a story arc in Applegeeks. Sadly, only Megatokyo remains of the three as of 2012.
    -   Technically, _Three Panel Soul_ might count as well, since it is a continuation of the now closed _Mac Hall_. Dom from _Megatokyo_ is even a regular character.
-   Two quasi-connected universes share some writers and creators. _Ménage à 3_ has spun off _Sticky Dilly Buns_ and _Sandra on the Rocks,_ and has featured brief guest appearances by characters from _Penny and Aggie_ and elsewhere. Meanwhile _Eerie Cuties_ has spun off _Magick Chicks_ and _Dangerously Chloe,_ while _Aoi House_, _Vampire Cheerleaders_, and _Paranormal Mystery Squad_ are apparently set in the same universe. The second of those universes also exists as fiction in the first, leading to "crossover" character appearances that are actually cosplayers, fantasy sequences, and suchlike.
-   The Narbonverse: _Narbonic_, _Li'l Mell_, and (confirmed by Artie's appearance in "If I Ran The Zoo") _Skin Horse_. _Smithson_ is in there as well, due to the appearance of an older version of Homeschool Joe from _Li'l Mell_. _North of Space_, Shaenon's high school strip, and _The Ratio_, her college strip, featured Mell and Dave respectively.
-   _To Prevent World Peace_ is a webcomic that tries to merge basically every single magical girl cliche into a single, unified Verse. With Genre Savvy villains in the mix, naturally.
-   The Wotchiverse, setting for _The Wotch_ and its various derivatives (_Cheer!_, _Triquetra Cats_, and possibly _Abstract Gender_). It is also shown to share continuity with webcomics with different authors (_Accidental Centaurs_ and possibly more).

    Web Original 

-   The Academy of Superheroes universe is a superhero universe with hundreds of stories and even more characters.
-   Many, if not all, Channel Awesome series seems to be set in the same 'verse owing to the number of crossovers between them, but a special note must be made for Atop the Fourth Wall and The Spoony Experiment, seeming to have the most points in common, most prominently Big Bad Dr. Insano.
    -   Many other internet reviewers of the same style in turn link back to those of Channel Awesome, some even becoming part of the site themselves before its mass exodus and inactivity.
-   The _Chaos Fighters_ universe, which is currently unnamed yet. It current encompasses two planets, Lefrad and Ketruin while Earth and Lerius are given a mention.
-   _Fire Emblem on Forums_: While most of the FEFs properly fall into The Multiverse rather than this trope, Haspen (the originator of the roleplays) has all of his take place in one world, the world of June, with complex histories connecting each one and detailing the events that lead from the epilogues of one to the beginning of his newest work.
-   _Hazbin Hotel_ and _Helluva Boss_ are two series made by Vivienne "Vivziepop" Medrano that take place in the same universe and the same Hell. The two make subtle references to each other, _Helluva Boss_ moreso since it's pilot went into production much later, but beyond that the stories are completely disconnected plot-wise.
-   _Heroes Unite_: The shared superhero universe on The Duck containing Webcomic/Energize and Webcomic/Bombshell amongst others is called the HUniverse (though this term has yet to actually appear in-setting).
-   The Breeniverse, the setting of _lonelygirl15_, _KateModern_, _LG15: the resistance_ and numerous spin-offs of uncertain canonicity.
-   The "Parody Universe" is the universe where all the Hitler parodies from the _Downfall_ scenes (and some spinoffs like Stalin parodies) takes place. The whole thing tends to get into Mind Screw territory due to the various amounts of parody videos that exist and Wild Mass Guessing is the norm in making sense of it.
-   The Randomverse is a very....random verse, containing The Insane Quest of Unfathomable Randomness, The Death Series, Smile For The Camera, and TV Tropes The Adventure.
-   The Slender Man Mythos is a somewhat loosely tied Verse, in that while Slendy himself ties everything together, the stories aren't typically tied together otherwise aside from the odd character commenting on other blogs. However, there's also the Everyman HYBRID Sub-Verse, which has expanded to include "Wicked Sticky Alex" and Can You See the Words. Evan made a brief cameo in the TJA Projects, and the Dark Harvest crew made a cameo appearance in one video. The series recently crossed over with Tribe Twelve and MLAnderson0. The HYBRID guys are also at least aware of Seeking Truth, and Stan Frederick is confirmed to take place in the same universe as well due to a minor Shout-Out, and having crossed over with Tribe Twelve. Unfortunately, Marble Hornets is confirmed to be fictional in this universe, meaning that Alex & Jay won't be showing up anytime soon. Though that didn't stop Tim Sutton from cameoing in EMH's Box 7.
    -   Despite focusing on another being entirely, Whispered Faith is confirmed to exist in this universe, as Noah Maxwell encounters Lee in New Jersey during an EMH crossover, and Stan Frederick has apparently been in contact with him as well.
-   Sonic for Hire and Mega Man Dies at the End are in the same universe starting with the Mega Man Dies at the End episode On the Lam which shows Sonic trying to escape from the prison Mega Man busts Wily out of. This is confirmed even more when a Sonic for Hire episode has Mega Man appear and has him mentioning events from the last crossover as well as leading directly into the next Mega Man Dies At The End episode.
-   The "MUniverse" is the setting of _Tales of MU_ and its spin-off and side stories. Part of a multiverse, as artifacts lost in a teleport mishap showed up in the author's other stories.

    Western Animation 

### **By Creator:**

-   Cartoon Network: _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_, _Evil Con Carne_, and _Underfist_ are all in the same universe as proof by Skarr being on both shows and numerous other Evil Con Carne characters having cameos. _Codename: Kids Next Door_, _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ and _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ were also confirmed to be in the same universe in _The Grim Adventures of the KND_.
-   The DC Animated Universe
-   Hanna-Barbera:
    -   The Flintstones and The Jetsons share the same universe as shown in _The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones_ Made-for-TV Movie.
    -   On the other hand you have the "Yogiverse" filled with Funny Animals like Yogi Bear (In fact, Yogi started as a secondary character on _The Huckleberry Hound Show_) and most Zany Cartoon made from the studio, most notable _Yogi's Treasure Hunt_ which reunited Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw, Snagglepuss, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy, Snooper and Blabber, Top Cat, Dick Dastardly and Muttley and countless cameos.
    -   Oddly enough, Action Cartoons like Jana of the Jungle has appeared as cameos in the universe so it may be seen as The Multiverse separating series like Space Ghost and Jonny Quest.
-   The universe of Jhonen Vasquez, creator of _Invader Zim_ And _Johnny the Homicidal Maniac_.
-   The Klasky-Csupo\-verse, which consists of _Rugrats_, its Spinoffs, _All Grown Up!_ and _Angelica and Susie's Pre-School Daze_, _The Wild Thornberrys_, and _Rocket Power_.
-   Marathon Media\-verse includes _Totally Spies!_, its Spinoff, _The Amazing Spiez!_, and _Martin Mystery_.
-   The Marvel Animated Universes
    -   The '90s Marvel Animated Verse including _Spider-Man: The Animated Series_ and _X-Men: The Animated Series_.
    -   Word of God is that _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_ was set in the same Verse as _Wolverine and the X-Men (2009)_, although they never actually interacted outside of the Hulk, Nick Fury, and Wolverine himself appearing in _EMH_. Same Word of God said that the "Wolverine" short in _Hulk Vs._ is also set the same universe.
    -   The current Marvel Animated Universe consists of _Ultimate Spider-Man (2012)_, _Avengers Assemble_, _Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H._, and _Guardians of the Galaxy (2015)_.
-   Mike Judge has _Beavis And Butthead_ and _Daria_ going to the same high school, but they might also share a universe with _King of the Hill_ and _The Goode Family_.
-   The Fuzzy Door Universe a.k.a the Seth MacFarlane Animated Universe contains _Family Guy_, _American Dad!_ and _The Cleveland Show_.
    -   Certain episodes of _Family Guy_ and _The Cleveland Show_ indicate _The Simpsons_ is part of it as well. And if that is the case, _The Critic_ and _Futurama_ may be too, however at least on the case of _The Simpsons_ the crossover episodes are not considered officially canon, also _The Simpsons_ exists as a TV show in _Futurama_ and vice versa both credited in their respective universes to Matt Groening. The existence of a multiverse (whether a Groeningverse or a Fox Animated Universe) caused whether by Homer's time travel in one of the Treehouse of Horror episodes or by one of the many time travels that happened in Futurama has been proposed by some fans to explain the apparent inconsistencies.
-   The Warner Bros. Animated Universe, also known as the Looney Tuneiverse (or Looney Tune Land as it was named in _Space Jam_), is the home of the characters from _Looney Tunes_ and its spin-offs, as well as those from _Tiny Toon Adventures_ and _Animaniacs_. Cameos from characters from _Pinky and the Brain_, _Histeria!_, _Freakazoid!!_, and _Road Rovers_ may put them into the same universe depending on the viewer's perception, although some of these cameos were under a Breaking the Fourth Wall Real-World Episode so, how canonical it is, it's up to you.
    -   To be more precise, in both _Animaniacs_ and _Tiny Toon_ the Looney Tunes exist as basically actors and their shorts are works of film were they appeared (think something like Roger Rabbit). In _Animaniacs_ the Warner Bros and Slappy were co-stars of the Looney Tunes (the Warners were trapped in the WB logo water tower for decades and Slappy seems to be an old retired and almost forgotten former actress), in _Tiny Toons_ the Looney Tunes are now retired actors working as teachers in a college teaching younger students how to be cartoons. The _Freakazoid_, _Pinky and the Brain_, and _Road Rovers_ cameos were mostly done in the form of celebrities in their free time and not entirely as their respective characters thus is possible that their respective shows are a Show Within a Show, and finally _Histeria_ seems to exist in its own Reality Warper continuity which transcends time and space.

### **By Title:**

-   _Darkwing Duck_ and _DuckTales (1987)_ are officially in the same universe. This does not include the reboot, although that has incorporated its own versions of characters from many of the The Disney Afternoon shows.
-   The Disney Animated Canon: Rapunzel and Flynn from _Tangled_ attend Elsa's coronation in _Frozen_ and, apparently, Rapunzel is Elsa and Anna's cousin.
    -   Two famous Easter Eggs show cameos of characters making appearances in other films. Scar's skin from _The Lion King_, for example, makes a split-second Crossover Cameo in _Hercules_ while Belle from _Beauty and the Beast_ can be seen walking down the street in one scene of _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_. Of course in the case of Scar this would contradict canon as Scar dies eaten by hyenas at the end of the movie, thus the skin seen in Hercules couldn't be his or at least not be that intact and in _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ France is normally run by the monarchy whilst in _Beauty and the Beast_ the Prince was magically cursed into looking like a Beast, which would be hard to reconcile.
        -   However, these are just Easter Eggs that inspired fan theories. Canonically speaking, Disney has two main (both separated) universes: one is the "realistic" universe mostly based on all the Disney princesses and all the fairy tale-based movies and connected media like videogames and TV shows (Hercules and Aladdin have a crossover episode for example), and then is the more "cartoony" universe with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, etc. A major crossover place like _House of Mouse_ were both collide is technically a case of Breaking the Fourth Wall as all the characters appear with the knowledge that they are animated characters in movies and shows, i.e. like in-universe celebrities.
    -   The Pixar Theory is a widespread fan theory that suggests every single Pixar film is set in the same universe, though an ever-increasing number of movies makes it increasingly difficult to reconcile all of them. Officially, aside from obvious cases of sequels and prequels, this is not the case.
-   The _South Park_ universe contains itself and _That's My Bush!_.
-   The original _Space Ghost_ cartoon was set in the same universe as _Dino-Boy_, _The Herculoids_, _Shazzan_, _Mighty Mightor_ and _Moby Dick_.
    -   _Space Ghost Coast to Coast_ on the other hand, is set in the same world as _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_, _The Brak Show_, _Perfect Hair Forever_, _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_ and _12 oz. Mouse_. Maybe a Multiverse. \[adult swim\]\-Verse? Williams Street-Verse?
-   The _Transformers_ franchise has an odd sort of 'verse, in that it's a multiverse with connecting pieces, rather than a universe.
    -   The 80's cartoon apparently exists in a shared continuity, of sorts, with _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero_, _Inhumanoids_, and _Jem and the Holograms_. There have been character cameos, and each show has the reporter/journalist (and Geraldo Rivera parody) Hector Ramirez.
