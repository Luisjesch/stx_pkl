**Salario:** Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh: what's that good for?  
**Shylock:** To bait fish withal.

A threat intended to make someone sexually uncomfortable; more often than not, a character threatens (sometimes subtly) to castrate someone.

Compare Groin Attack. Crippling Castration may result if the threat is actually carried out. See also Phallic Weapon, when it's the weapon itself that has Freudian overtones. Can be paired with Psychosexual Horror.

The remake keeps this intact, with the bonus of hearing Corneo squirm every time a threat is issued.
-   _Friday Night Funkin'_: In Week 6, Senpai invokes this trope by threatening to "rip \[Boyfriend's\] nuts off right after \[his\] girlfriend finishes gargling \[Senpai's\]" before "Roses". _Ouch._
-   During an interrogation during Thane's loyalty mission in _Mass Effect 2_, a Renegade Shepard can choose to rough up the suspect and wrap things up like so:
    
    **Elias Kelham:** Are we done here? Because I got people to see.  
    _\[Shepard slams his/her forearm against the guy's throat\]_  
    **Shepard:** I'm done being patient. Give me a name, or I'll cut your balls off and sell them to a krogan! <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
-   _Mass Effect: Andromeda:_ Drack's loyalty mission begins when a krogan botanist's assistant accidentally causes the theft of a ship of vital importance to the krogan colony. As Drack puts it to the unfortunate schmuck, if Nakmor Morda finds out what's happened, she'd roast his quads over a low fire.
-   In _No More Heroes_, Sylvia says to Travis: "If I ever hear you mumble another woman's name in your sleep, you'll wake up the next morning with your joystick missing."
-   In _Grand Theft Auto V_, if you choose the "Roof" option for The Bureau Raid and pick Taliana Martinez as your getaway driver, she'll threaten to do this to any crew member that blows their cover while they're making their getaway in the ambulance.
-   _Saints Row: The Third_: In "Return to Steelport", you head to a BDSM club owned by the Morningstar in order to rescue Zimos, a potential ally. You have to shake down some of the clientele to get a lead as to Zimos' location.
    
    **Boss (Female 1):** Zimos, where is he?  
    **Customer:** If I say anything, the DeWynter sisters will cut me off!  
    **Boss:** Funny, I was thinking of cutting something off too...
    
-   In _Red Dead Redemption II_, Kieran Duffy is threatened with "gelding" if he won't tell Dutch where O'Driscoll is hiding, as Dutch thinks Kieran is working for him.

-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_: Chi-Chi has done this twice. In episode 3, she casually threatens to castrate Krillin for telling her that Goku is dead and that Gohan has been kidnapped by Piccolo. In episode 59, she threatens to "tie Goku to a chair, gag him with a radish and castrate him with a butter knife" for making Gohan fight Cell.
-   _Helluva Boss_: In "Oops", Asmodeus is confident that none of his subordinates will blab about his not-so\-Secret Relationship with Fizzarolli. After all, he can retaliate in the most Freudian of ways; he demonstrates this by punching a statue's dick into rubble. The demons present quickly take the hint (some of them even reflexively cover their groins) and leave the room.
    
    **Fizzarolli:** Ozz, you know there's eyes around...  
    **Ozzie:** I know. I don't care. 'Cuz they know if they tell anyone, I'll _**BREAK THEM**_.
    
-   _Not Always Right_: ...and feed them to the pigeons.
-   _SuperMarioLogan_: Mr. Goodman, a rich and greedy business man, has become infamous for threatening Mario with extreme acts of violence if he screws something up or doesn't make his "house payments", usually involving his testicles. In "The Nintendo Switch!", he threatened to rip Mario's ballsack off with his mouth, and in "The Diamond!", he threatened to sew his mouth to Mario's ballsack. And in "Jeffy The Rapper 2!", he threatened to twist Mario's nipple even harder than a Texas Titty Twister, rip it off, and eat it. After SuperMarioLogan began getting demonetized following the "Jeffy's Tantrum!" controversy and ElsaGate, Goodman stopped making these outlandish threats, and became more of an exaggerated caricature of the 1% who only threatens eviction, not a bloodthirsty serial killer masquerading as a businessman who is more likely to mutilate himself for his own pleasure, or make an Implied Death Threat without outright saying it. In Character Q&A videos created by Goodman's voice actor (who also voices several other major characters in the series), Goodman has stated multiple times he eats testicles and nipples, with the heavy implication that his collection of "house payments" are an elaborate extortion scheme to acquire more testicles and nipples, something he can get away with because, 99% of the time, he's a Karma Houdini due to every cop in the city being extremely corrupt and accepting bribes like candy, essentially making Goodman an Invincible Villain (though he does get his comeuppance every once in a while), all of which serve to make Goodman one of the single-most hated characters in the series along with controversial Creator's Pet Jeffy.
-   _Things Mr. Welch Is No Longer Allowed to Do in an RPG_: Mr. Welch "can't make anyone Jewish with a called shot."

-   In _X-Men: Evolution_, Rogue catches Spyke videotaping her without her permission. She tells him that, if she sees herself in his video when he presents it to their class, "They're going to call \[him\] Spyke-_less_."
-   _The Boondocks_:
    -   In Granddad's tale of "The Story of Catcher Freeman", after the other slaves trick Masta Colonel into condensing his efforts at intimidation onto solely his Butt-Monkey house slave Tobias, Masta Colonel states that if their work isn't done when he next comes out, "I'm cutting both \[Tobias'\] balls off."
    -   In another episode, Riley enlists Ed III's help in getting back a chain a bully stole from him. Ed hangs the kid upside down and places two grapes in front of him. He tells him to imagine that the grapes are his testicles, right before he smashes them with a sledgehammer. Ed threatens to do the same to him if he doesn't give back the chain. Ed being Ed, it turns out he got the wrong kid. Even though Riley gave him a picture.
-   _Archer_:
    -   In the episode "Placebo Effect", Archer threatens to slide a knife into a terrified pharmacist's urethra unless he gives him information regarding Irish mobsters selling fake chemo drugs. Needless to say, he spills the beans so fast that Archer can barely keep up.
    -   Malory combines this trope with Forced to Watch and Noodle Implements in truly spectacular fashion when she threatens to "literally emasculate" Krieger:
        
        **Malory:** Woodhouse, dear, I need some more ice. Oh, and a small bowl, a mirror, a needle and thread, and a straight razor.  
        **Krieger:** What the hell was the mirror for?  
        **Malory:** So you could _watch._  
        **Krieger:** Eep.
        
-   A bizarre train-equivalent example occurs in _Thomas & Friends_ where Sir Topham Hatt threatens to "cut Duncan down to size" if he acts up again. It's shown that he's referring to Duncan's rather long funnel, and Duncan immediately behaves upon hearing said threat.
-   In _The Simpsons_, Bart tries to avoid getting beaten up in juvie by hanging on the fence separating the girl and boy side of the yard, but that just leads the leader of a girl's gang to threaten him with a "very uneventful puberty".
-   In Rick and Morty by the family dog, Snowball, manages to gain sapience, and threatens to do this to Jerry in retaliation for his own castration back when he was a normal dog. Jerry, being, well, Jerry, doesn't get it.
    
    **Snowball:** You're being _very_ aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow, Dr. Scrabbs will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.  
    **Dr. Scrabbs:** _(menacingly holds up a pair of surgical scissors)_  
    **Jerry:** _Hah!_ You think you can control me with a haircut?
