Nope, not safe to go back in the water.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain. But when you put it in the body of a Great White shark, ooh, suddenly you've gone too far!"_

Want to make a (usually) aquatic situation a dangerous nightmare? One way is _sharks_.

Trapped in the middle of the ocean with no realistic way of making it to civilization, likely go crazy and dehydrate in a couple of days? That takes too long? No worries, the ocean is infested with sharks just waiting to devour you. Has the Big Bad got you? He won't shoot, that'd be too fast, he'll instead lower you into a Shark Pool.

If you're swimming or anywhere near water, the last thing you want to hear is "shark". In fictionland, or rather fiction-ocean, many sharks are unstoppable sea-monster killing machines which devour everything in sight: fish, seals, people... license plates, car tires, suits of armour, car parts, severed human limbs. Sometimes they'll even attack ships: that's how badass they are. Most animals eat to live, but sharks live to eat. Sharks are the ultimate Rule of Cool. Perhaps it's because it's how their mouths are lined with literally hundreds of teeth, or because they can smell your blood from miles away like a hungry vampire, or because they can sense your bioelectricity meaning you can never hide from them. Perhaps it's because they have changed very little in the millions of years they existed. It doesn't matter, they're the most badass animal that isn't extinct or made up. If they ever find a way to take to the land or air, it would surely be the end of us all. Really, if Sand Is Water, expect Land Sharks.

In some cases, prehistoric sharks such as megalodons are used instead of modern ones, sometimes with them being portrayed as Sea Monsters.

(Cool as they are, there are still ways to enhance them.)

Sub-Trope of Fiendish Fish. A Super-Trope to Shark Man. Often first seen as a tell-tale Shark Fin of Doom.

Compare Sea Monster (for other scary things in the ocean), Never Smile at a Crocodile and Pike Peril (for the rivers-and-lakes counterpart), Monstrous Seal, and Bears Are Bad News. You can relax if there are Devious Dolphins though, since they make perfect rivals to these sharks.

Contrast Shamu Fu, the one situation where things may legitimately get _better_ when you add a shark. Do not confuse with tropes with other meanings of "shark", such as Loan Shark, Voodoo Shark, or media references like Jump the Shark.

Ironically, sharks are nowhere near as dangerous as the stereotype makes them out to be. Hundreds of people have been attacked and killed over the last few centuries. That sounds like a lot, but put it compared to the tens of thousands of fatalities to large felines, bears, wolves, and plenty of domestic animals and it becomes positively puny. Out of the over 400 known species of sharks, only 35 have been documented to attack humans, and even then only two (bull sharks and oceanic whitetip sharks) are consistently dangerous. Even the infamous Great White, a shark specially evolved to feed off mammals, generally ignores humans in all but freak incidents. The rate of shark attacks and deaths average out to about a couple of deaths a year globally, making them less dangerous than elephants, jellyfish, domestic animals like horses and dogs, and the common staircase. In fact, some sharks are surprisingly intelligent and social animals, rather than the mindless carnivores they're portrayed as, and they've taken on a diversity of habitats and body designs beyond the usual torpedo shape. And despite their reputation as the terror of the seas, sharks aren't even the top predator. That distinction goes to orcas a.k.a. killer whales, who regularly hunt sharks to dine on their livers. However, because orcas, for the most part, are curious creatures that not only do not prey on humans but are actually intelligent enough to team up with them to take down whales, they do not have the fearsome reputation of, say, the Great White.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Agito from _Air Gear_ has sharks as his animal motifs. He's brutal in battle.
-   _Bleach_ has Tier Harribel, whose visual theme is that of a shark. Like Kisame above, she is also a contrast to the usual shark tropes — Harribel is a Mama Bear Martial Pacifist who is willing to die for her Fracción.
-   In _Blue Submarine No. 6_, not only is there an antagonist who is a shark-person but it seems as though his main mode of transportation is built on a WHALE SHARK.
-   The main plot point of a _Doraemon_ Fishing Episode, "The Jaws of the Parking Lot". Nobita wants to go fishing but doesn't feel like traveling too far, so Doraemon uses a gadget to turn the Open Lot into an impromptu pool where fishes from the Atlantic can _swim through soil_ and fished out. Then a Great White somehow made it into the lot and crosses the boundary, requiring Nobita and Doraemon to track it down before it can attack anyone. Said Great White nearly chomps on Nobita, but Doraemon arrives right on time with a portal hoop, where the Great White jumps through and back into the ocean (This short was partially used as a sub-plot of _Doraemon: Nobita's Great Battle of the Mermaid King_ via Adaptation Amalgamation).
-   The first half of the first episode of _Future Boy Conan_ has Conan doing battle with a huge shark with a scarred snout that has been eating his and his grandfather’s fish supply, so he decides to put a stop to it once and for all.
-   BrokenGao in _GaoGaiGar FINAL_ forms the right shoulder of Genesic GaoGaiGar and represents destruction in all its glory.
-   _Godzilla: Singular Point_ redesigns the sea serpent kaiju Manda to feature a goblin shark-like face instead of the traditional Asian dragon look.
-   In _Guardian Fairy Michel_, since nature is out of balance, sharks attack Donna and her son Will in episode 3.
-   The manga _Gyo_ is about fishes with mechanical legs that crawl out of the ocean and invade the city, infecting the people with poisonous gases. Needless to say, there is a shark involved, and that's when things get really bad. There is a scene where a shark kicks down a door, with a big GASHUNK sound in the English version. According to Junji Ito, his entire motivation for creating the series can be summed up as "sharks are scary, but they can't go out of the water—therefore, a shark that can go out of the water would be incredibly scary."
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_: While Sakuya's _Titanic_ was sinking, an already-wounded Hayate swam in the frigid water to push a raft holding Isumi to safety. Then the sharks attacked him.... But all bets were off when he saw one of them attack _Nagi_.
-   In _Heavy Object_, the Capitalist Enterprise is ostensibly restoring the shark population around Hawaii as part of a business venture. The truth is this is being done to increase the number of shark attacks and damage the tourism industry, which is being used by spies from the other nations. The Enterprise also uses the situation to engineer "shark attacks" on inconvenient people.
-   _Iron Wok Jan_: The semifinal battle of the second Tournament Arc has shark as the theme ingredient. The pre-prepared shark meat is unusable. What do you do? _Jump_ into the tank of live sharks also prepared, _kick_ a shark out, and butcher it in front of the audience. Of course after Jan and the rival from China jump into the shark tank to secure their ingredient, one of the other contestants realizes that it would be easier to just smash the glass walls of the shark tank to drain all the water out of it.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   In Part 3, Jotaro Kujo saves the little girl Anne from a shark, using his Stand, Star Platinum, to sock it out of the water in a single punch.
    -   Part 5, the situation is played straight with Squalo's Stand, Clash, which that takes the form of a metallic shark with three eyes. Its power is teleport from one body of water (or other mostly-water liquid like a bowl of soup or glass of wine), capture its targets, _and drag them along on the teleporting trips_ (where, if Squalo isn't stopped quickly enough, _they'll drown_). What's more, Clash is supplemented by Talking Head, the Stand of his partner, Tiziano, which can force a person to only tell lies, so even if you see Clash, _you can't tell anyone_.
-   Unabara Bancho from _Kongoh Bancho_ is a giant Megalodon wearing a Bancho uniform who at one point tries to devour the protagonists but is fished by Gouriki Bancho and beached. He's a gluttonous, sentient beast who has an army of swordfish obeying his orders.
-   Played with in _Kyo Kara Maoh!_. Yuuri is transported into the middle of an ocean and appears to be under attack by a shark. It turns out that sharks in the other world are friendly vegetarians.
-   Shark Fujishiro from _My Bride is a Mermaid_ is a literal shark with a human guise from a group of mermaid Yakuza. His motto being that all problems can be solved by eating the cause of the chaos. He's constantly trying to eat the main character of the series, Nagasumi. The fact he can turn into a shark on land doesn't help matters much either.
-   _The Mysterious Cities of Gold_: It wasn't enough that Esteban, Zia, Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro were stranded on a flimsy raft in the middle of the ocean. They had to be attacked by sharks as well.
-   Hoshigaki Kisame from _Naruto_ is a human with shark-like traits and has an affinity for attacks that use water including several that blasts the opponent with water shaped like at least one shark. He also has a shark-like sword, which he can merge with to become a full blown half-man half-shark creature.
    
    Unlike the animal stereotype, though, Kisame seems rather played straight. He seems to have a good sense of humor, is definitely the most mentally sound of the Akatsuki, and has a certain joie-de-vivre that his partner needed to pick up on (and on the note of his partner... Kisame seems to have been more of a father toward Itachi than Fugaku). In general, he is a polite, intelligent, and a very social man... however, his mere presence seems to announce "You lose," with natural chakra reserves rivaling the Jinchuriki, who host 100-meter-tall chakra demons. Until even more fittingly he meets Killer Bee... who has _octopus_ traits.
    
    Kisame's shark appearance takes on even greater meaning when you consider his backstory. He kills all his comrades so that they won't get captured and interrogated by Ibiki, then kills his superior, the previous wielder of Samehada, for selling him out. After being paired with Akatsuki, he notes that they were put together because both had killed their comrades, noting how sharks' offspring kill and eat each other.
    
-   The Beach Chapter in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ involves The Hero being attacked by a shark... that knows kung fu. It turns out to be his martial arts teacher Kuu Fei in a stuffed shark that she borrowed from the hotel lobby, along with Natsumi in a shark costume in a ploy to get Negi and Asuna back together by placing him in a perceived danger to be rescued.
-   Inverted in _Nichijou_. Ask the Professor, and she'll tell you Everything's Better with Sharks.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Of all the Fish-men, the shark ones are definitely the worst to run into. Arlong, the main antagonist of the East Blue arc, is a sawshark. And a Loan Shark to boot.
    -   Jimbei who is definitely making everything worse for the World Government by teaming up with Luffy and Crocodile is a whale shark. He soon inverts this trope, summoning a whole school of friendly, grinning whale sharks to carry the escaped prisoners to safety. Not much of a surprise, since whale sharks can't eat mammals — they feed on krill and tiny fish, instead.
    -   Now things are even worse with Hody Jones' crew, which has _four_ different shark Fishmen, Jones himself being a great white shark.
    -   Add on Captain of the Flying Dutchman, Van Der Decken IX, who is a bullhead shark. Not as fearsome as a great white, but he seems to be the main villain of this arc.
    -   The trope is also inverted by Prince Fukaboshi, a shark merman (unspecified, which is odd considering Oda's penchant for classifying his mer/fishpeople) who the Strawhats assume is there to give them trouble and run away... when he intended to personally invite them to the royal palace and give Luffy a message from Jimbei.
    -   Also averted with Madame Sharley, who is very polite and calm. As long as you're not rude around her. This is even more notorious because she is the younger sister of **Arlong**, of all merpeople.
    -   Also inverted again by Megalo, a friendly pet shark of the Neptune royal family.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   In the early manga, Ranma and Cologne fight at the beach and in the ocean. When Cologne touches down lightly on the surface of the water, everyone is astonished at how an Old Master can find footing even on a floating twig. Turns out she landed on top of a _great white shark_, which she somehow commandeers to do her bidding. It doesn't end well for the shark when Ranma goes into the Cat-Fist, though. The anime, for some reason, traded the beach fight (the final part of the Phoenix Pill storyline) for a fight in the mountains; apparently, they figured Cologne using telekinesis to fling showers of ice boulders would be more dramatic.
    -   Both the manga and an anime episode have Akane accepting Principal "Nutjob" Kunô's offer to teach her how to swim. Plan 1: strap a big boulder to her back and toss her into the pool... which is currently home to a four-meter-long shark.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_: Apparently inspired by the pirates of _How to Kill a Mockingbird_, Squalo rides a flying burning shark as his box weapon. Seriously.
-   Viral from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ is a Beastman that Gainax has explicitly stated is a shark with feline genetics. Besides his claws and cat eyes, he's got a mouth full of shark teeth. They grow back if they're pulled out. His smiles tend to make viewers rather uneasy.
-   _Toriko_ has a plethora of unusual and powerful shark animals in the world, including the Gator Shark (a fresh-water giant shark with a crocodile-like mouth), Great Leg (amphibious shark with four legs), Warner Shark (a shark with teeth so strong they can bite through a submarine), Sand Shark (sand-swimming shark), Fly Shark (giant sharks able to fly with their fin-like wings), Big Bang Shark (a flying, pitch black Animalistic Abomination), the Denshark (a shark/train hybrid) and the Raizame (an uber-powerful giant shark with electrical fangs).
-   Averted in _Transformers: Robots in Disguise_ with Sky-Byte. While one of the Predacons, Sky-Byte is an aspiring poet and quite fond of humans — between these and various comedic appearances, he's something of an Ensemble Dark Horse. He's also the only one of the Predacons or Decepticons to escape at the end of the series, so everything works out for him.
-   Ryoga "Shark" Kamishiro of _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_, introduced as the school bully and a major Jerkass. He also uses a Shark deck. Later inverted after he joins Yuma's group.

    Arts 

    Asian Animation 

-   In _Happy Heroes_, one of the many recurring monsters of the week, introduced in Season 2 episode 50, is a flying shark. In his first appearance, he manages to eat quite a few of the city folk, including Smart S. and Careful S. (and by extension the latter's duplicates) before he spits them all out after Happy S. hits him in a weak point.
-   _Momo (2022)_: Subverted in "All About Shark". Momo visits the new shark exhibit and comes across a den. A shark chases Momo out of the dark until he corners her and reveals he is happy to have a guest at the party he had been celebrating alone.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: The Shark creature type originally debuted with Giant Shark, which remained the only such card for a long while; the Grand Creature Type Update of '07 later changed its type to Fish, which is what Hammerhead Shark was released as. Unfortunately, since they're sharks, they can only attack if the opposing planeswalker is near a body of water (i.e. they have islands). Since your character is a plane-shifting physical god, you can turn your opponents' lands into islands with certain spells. The _Ikoria_ set would later properly reintroduce the Shark type, retconning a few older cards to be typed as such. Notable specimens introduced after this change include the huge Voracious Greatshark, shown maw-first as it pursues a hapless rowboat, and Spiked Megalodon, a beast big enough to shatter a galleon with one bite.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   Prior the _ZEXAL_ era: Corroding Shark and Cyber Shark, a zombie/robot shark respectively, Metabo Shark, Deepsea Shark, Shark Cruiser, a shark ship, Man-Eating Black Shark, Great White Terror, Misairuzame, a _missile shark_, Abyssal Kingshark, and the Great White, a giant shark with hands.
    -   Thanks to Shark's Shark deck, Shark cards have become an actual archetype. Shark decks are pretty offensive and they are capable of Xyz Summoning Xyz Shark monsters: Submersible Carrier Aero Shark, Shark Caesar, Shark Fortress, Bahamut Shark, Number 32: Shark Drake, Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss, Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark, and Number 47: Nightmare Shark.

    Comic Books 

-   The old British comic _Action_ had a serial called _Hook Jaw_. The title character was a great white shark. None of the other characters lasted more than one story... Well, except for the token good human in the first story, though even he got eaten alive about two-thirds of the way through the second story.
-   The first album in the French comic _The Adventures of Jérôme Moucherot_ revolves around a giant shark who lives in a bizarro dimension in between the walls of apartment buildings. Yes, he can "swim" on the surface of walls or ceilings with his fin being the only sign that there's a huge friggin' shark stalking you in your living room. He gets in the protagonist's crosshairs when he eats his son and he has to follow the shark into its own dimension to get him back.
-   In _Alan Ford_, recurring popular villain Superciuk seemingly meets his doom when he's swallowed whole by a shark... but he manages to survive, leading to several sightings of a "talking dogfish" begging for Barbera. The shark is eventually captured and confined in a pool, which allows Superciuk to get out.
-   Aquaman can command anything in the ocean. If he's feeling generous, he'll just send dolphins, whales, and giant squid to beat you up and ensnare you. If he's _not_, he breaks out the sharks. Get him in a bad mood, and you can have sharks _and_ Eldritch Abominations up your ass.
-   _Batman_:
    -   Batman even keeps Shark-Repellent Bat-Spray in his utility belt!
    -   There's also the Batman villain Great White, a former "white collar criminal". It started as a nickname due to his shady financial practices. However he gets sent to Arkham and, well... let's just say he ends up with an Astonishingly Appropriate Appearance.
-   In _Cavewoman: Deep Water_, Meriem is attacked (while naked) by a megalodon. She kills it by swimming inside its gills and destroying them.
-   A story arc of _Fallen Angel_ has a shark goring Jude's leg... in the middle.
-   In _The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones_ #20, the villain attempts to escape from Indy by jumping overboard and swimming away. However, he inadvertently swims into chummed water (created when he threw a bucket of chum at Indy at missed) and his devoured by sharks attracted by the chum.
-   _The Guardian Project_: Averted with the Shark, who was one of the good guys and can summon sharks.
-   One of the "possible" stories included in _Hack/Slash: Trailers_ feature a slasher shark named Blackfin, who was big enough to devour the great white mistaken for him in one bite.
-   German comic _Haiopeis_.
-   _Indiana Jones and the Tomb of the Gods_: Oh, so the Big Bad Nazi has Indy at gunpoint in a seized ship miles away from the nearest coast. If he kills him there nobody will know. But does he shoot him? Naaah, that would be too easy. Better drop him in a lifeboat with no oars to starve or die of dehydration. But wait, that would be too slow. Shoot the boat with a machine gun so it'll sink sooner or later. Enough? Nope, make a cut on the Girl of the Week's arm and kick her into the water so sharks will smell her blood and do a Zerg Rush to the area. And if loads and loads of sharks aren't scary enough, don't worry, a massive Great White will show up to teach them the job.
-   Iron Man, or rather Tony Stark seeing he was out of his armour, was dumped into shark-infested waters once. He proceeded to fight a great white, _bite_ into it to get it to start bleeding, which drew the other sharks in order to attack **it**.
-   _The Punisher_
    -   Barracuda from MAX series, a badass hitman, manages to win a brutal fight with the Punisher. Instead of just shooting him, Barracuda throws him into the ocean with a bleeding gangster and a Great White.
    -   An earlier one-shot had a villain attempt to shoot Castle, who was standing in front of an Aquarium shark tank. Castle dived out of the way, and somehow, the handgun bullets managed to shatter the tank and send an angry shark right at the gangster.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_:
    -   Razor the Shark is hot-headed and a little bloodthirsty, but he's one of the good guys; being a loyal bodyguard and friend to Meropis' priestess Coral the Betta and has an almost brotherly bond with her apprentice Pearly the Manta Ray. To cement this, his pet Chao, Crusher, takes after his personality, something Chao only do to those who show them love and care.
    -   Razor's sister Blade. She's cold, blunt, and generally rude and unpleasant to be around (her brother, captain, and father figure being the exceptions), she has no regard for others' well-being and openly admits she enjoys stealing from and hurting people for the sense of triumph and glory.
-   _Superboy (1994)_ gives us the character King Shark, the son of the Hawaiian shark god (we're assuming Ka-moho-ali'i). He's capable of regeneration, which is good because Jeanette of _Secret Six_ breaks his jaw and rips off his arm.
-   In the final story of the Bronze Age reality from the _Superman_ story arc of 1998, _The Dominus Effect_, Superman deals with the threat of a menacing shark in Metropolis' waters, only to find out that it was a mechanical shark and it was being controlled by the Prankster.
-   _Tintin_: Subverted in _Red Rackham's Treasure_, where Professor Calculus builds a small submarine in the shape of a shark. Haddock first sees it when trying to take a potshot at a bunch of circling sharks.
-   In _Watchmen_, the cast-away of the comic within a comic _Tales of the Black Freighter_ suffers from this. Not only does he have to escape from the island in a raft made of the bodies of his partners, but he also has to fight several sharks.
-   _Water Baby_ revolves around this. Brody was a surfer, one day she was riding the waves and a shark confused her with something edible.

-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Volume 1_: In the Wonder Girl Impossible Tale in #111 a massive shark tries to take a bite out of Diana while she's floating on her back near Paradise Island. Renno is able to warn her of its approach, and get knocked for a loop by the shark himself, in time for her to dodge it, grab it by the tail and toss it away.
    -   In Vol 3, the island of Themiscyra is protected by Megalodons, who are good and even offer themselves up for a Heroic Sacrifice to save the island on one occasion.
    -   _Sensational Wonder Woman_: Giganta finds herself being attacked by the Megalodons that patrol Themyscira's waters during a battle with Diana in _The Queen's Hive._
-   In an issue of _X-Force_, an alternate universe version of Nightcrawler confronted the Blob from the same universe, during a battle in an underwater base. While at first, the Blob looked like winning, Nightcrawler got some outside help — he teleported a passing shark _into the Blob's stomach_.
-   _X-Men_
    -   Cyclops has fought sharks on occasion. Great whites, naturally.
    -   The short-lived X-Man Thunderbird III had very few badass moments, but one of those was when he fought and killed a great white shark all by himself.

-   Subverted in a _B.C._ strip from November 18, 2023. A snake falls into the water and encounters a Shark Fin of Doom. The shark bumps the snake back on the dock, unharmed.
-   _The Far Side_ practically predicted this entry and its terrestrial counterpart, with a strip showing a shark attempting to scare humans into the water by yelling "Bear!"

    Fairy Tales 

-   In the Fairy Tale _An Impossible Enchantment,_ the fairy queen summons two thousand sharks to guard the tower where Princess Graziella is imprisoned — to prevent anyone from approaching.

    Fan Works 

-   _All Mixed Up!_: Inverted for Diesel, Mariana Mag's shark-dolphin hybrid that she cares for in her aquarium. Although he gets a little rough at times, he is very friendly and loves to play, and is also very fond of Mariana, who loves him back.
-   Late in _Christian Humber Reloaded_, the main character meets a shark/human hybrid named Chridion. Chridion manages the improbable feat of _gaining the upper hand_ against the God-Mode Sue protagonist for most of the fight, largely due to his superior speed and Shoulder Cannon, only conceding defeat when Vash powers up enough to almost destroy the world.
-   _A Diplomatic Visit_: In chapter 8 of the third story, _Diplomacy Through Schooling_, it's mentioned that one mistook Luna for a seal when she and Pharynx were out for a midnight swim during their honeymoon. Luckily, it backed off when it got biffed on the nose. It's further noted that the seapony kingdoms have also had issues with them in the past.
-   From _Divine Blood_, Naiki Satomi, the daughter of Ranma Saotome and Poseidon has an affinity for sharks right down to a mouth full of sharp teeth. She is the most obviously reckless of the three Satomi siblings and, especially in early chapters, sometimes has a tendency to make situations worse by sheer accident. However, she is described as having a cute smile despite having a carnivore's dental work. In battle against her father, she summons a megalodon and a swarm of other sharks to fight him.
-   The library in _Egg Belly_ has Book Sharks. They're kind of like bookworms, only they're sharks.
-   In Book 4 of _Forged Destiny_. Wouldn't you know it, the one time Jaune takes a dip in the ocean, he is surrounded by a shiver of sharks with one quickly latching onto his leg. Justified as they were drawn to the large number of bodies tied to the ocean floor and the one that grabbed him quickly pulled him to the surface, as it was asked to by Qrow, a Druid. All of the sharks then work together and attack the large Grimm that had knocked Jaune into the ocean to begin with.
-   _A Growing Affection_ changes Kisame's back story to make him instead Jinchuriki of the Seven-Fins Shark and Samehada is made from a strip of the demon's skin.
-   _Lincoln's Memories_:
    -   Discussed in "Bath Time" when Lynn Loud Jr. pretends her rubber shark is planning on eating Lincoln's rubber duck.
    -   Discussed again in "The Ultimate Sand Castle" where Lucy wants to get bit by a shark so she can have a cool scar, and Lola and Lynn Sr. are afraid of being bit by a shark.
-   _Prehistoric Earth_: Squalicorax and megalodon are amongst the animals rescued for the titular zoo. And while not to the exaggerated degree featured in most examples, they both prove fairly dangerous animals for the rescue team and park staff to handle.
-   _Prehistoric Park Reimagined_: Heavily zigzagged. The lonchidion, xenacanthus, stethacanthus, gogoselachus, and otodus auriculatus all prove aversions (with the lonchidion and xenacanthus being too small and seemingly docile to be much of a threat, the gogoselachus and stethacanthus being more curious than aggressive, and the otodus auriculatus being perfectly willing to nonviolently share an offering of meat that's already in the midst of getting eaten by a group of pterosphenus). The otodus angustidens, however, are portrayed as intimidating predators that menace a pod of zygorhiza in the midst of undergoing birthing of their young.
-   _Realistic Pokémon_:
    -   Garchomp, a hammerhead shark mixed with a T. rex.
    -   Sharpedo, a great white shark that traded in its tail for jet propulsion.

-   _By the Sea_: The plot of this _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ fanfic is set off by Cody getting bitten by a shark while fighting in against vicious enemies who use them as mounts. The shark nearly kills Cody and his people and loved ones give him up for dead as the ocean carries his unconscious body away to wash up on Obi-Wan's beach.

    Films — Animation 

-   Played with in _Back to the Outback_. While crossing the harbor to reach the city after escaping captivity, the group meets a great white shark named Jacinta, who is a Nice Girl that helps them by informing them of the Ugly Secret Society's existence and giving them a lift to the other side of the harbor. On the other hand, she doesn't deny Maddie's assumption of her having eaten more people than Maddie is capable of poisoning and accepts her self-given title of "the face of death".
-   Vector, the villain in _Despicable Me_, has a guard-shark.
-   Another one for sharks that don't eat everything in sight, _Finding Nemo_. Not quite vegetarians, it's hinted that they eat dolphins, and they have a "slip" every now and then and eat a fish. The heroes run into three, including one named Bruce, a Shout-Out to the _Jaws_ prop.
    -   _Finding Dory_ averts this with Destiny, who is indeed a shark, a whale shark at that. She still has as big a mouth as, or maybe even bigger than, her fellow bretheren, yet is still non-threatening because she has no teeth. Also, in Real Life, whale sharks eat nothing bigger than a goldfish.
-   In _James and the Giant Peach_, there's a robot shark.
-   _The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island_ has a prehistoric shark — possibly a Ginsu shark — as a "swimming sharp tooth".
-   In _The LEGO Movie_, President Business' office is guarded by, amongst other things, sharks, lasers, and laser sharks. Also, one of the Master Builders throws a shark at Emmet when the latter's speech fails to rally the heroes. It chirps like a dolphin.
-   _Lilo & Stitch_: Pleakley gets menaced by a shark at one point while swimming back to shore after he and Jumba tried (and failed) to catch Stitch as he was surfing with Nani and Lilo, but the animal is never actually shown onscreen. All we get are Pleakley's comments as he sees it and tries to get away:
-   Glut the Shark from _The Little Mermaid (1989)_. He chases Ariel and Flounder through the ship wreck, determined to eat them both.
-   The sequel _The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea_ has Morgana's minion, Undertow the giant tiger shark who spends most of the movie trapped in the body of a piranha thanks to King Triton's magic.
-   In _Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa_, Mort is chased by a shark. Through land. All the way into a volcano.
-   In the Pixar short _Partly Cloudy_ (shown before _Up_), living clouds make human babies, puppies, kittens, etc., who are delivered by Delivery Storks. There's also a rain cloud who specializes in... _slightly_ less adorable critters, and his stork seriously begins to regret their partnership when the rain cloud presents him with a model shark (which is bigger than the stork).
-   _The Reef_ has Troy, who loves to abuse the habitats of the Reef and the main hero of the story. Though, he acts more like your stereotypical bully rather than a ferocious predator.
-   Sharks are the main antagonists in _Seal Team (2021)_, playing the standard Carnivores Are Mean schtick. Curiously, the movie plays with it by also introducing Dave the basking shark, which true to life is harmless but very much despised by everyone, and the credits semi-address the problems of shark depictions in media before devolving into a joke about Dave eating car tires.
-   _Shark Tale_, obviously by its name, features a gang of sharks who function as an analog to The Mafia. Subverted in the case of Lenny, a vegetarian shark who actually gets nauseated at the very taste of a fish.
-   _Tintin and the Lake of Sharks_ has, wait for it, a lake... full of sharks. Metaphorical ones, that is. It's actually a _Balkan mountain lake_. The villains' Underwater Base may also have a Shark Pool or two.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The TV Movie _12 Days of Terror_ is based on real events that happened in the summer of 1916 where seemingly the same shark attacked five swimmers in a series of shark attacks along the New Jersey coast and up a freshwater creek.
-   _2-Headed Shark Attack_: Double trouble!
    -   _5-Headed Shark Attack_: Because two wasn't bad enough!
-   _47 Meters Down:_ Two sisters are trapped in a shark cage at the bottom of the ocean. With great white sharks circling nearby, they must fight to survive.
-   In _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_, Ace goes to a tank expecting to find the stolen dolphin. He instead finds a great white shark. Hilarity ensues, especially when he returns to the main hall via the bathroom, his clothes all torn and wet.
    
    **Ace:** Do _not_ go in there!
    
-   _The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl_: Averted. The sharks do briefly mention taking a bite out of Sharkboy when he becomes lost at sea but, once they realize that he's a friend, they raise him as one of their own.
-   _Aquaman (2018)_ inverts this trope, as sharks are shown as war mounts and allies to the characters. In particular, a large shark rescues a young Arthur from some bullies when he's harassed at an aquarium.
-   _Atomic Shark_ gives us one that boils the water, sets things on fire, and/or blows things up by its mere proximity.
-   _Austin Powers_: Dr. Evil _wanted_ sharks, with Frickin' Laser Beams attached to their heads no less, but logistical problems meant he had to settle for ill-tempered, mutated sea bass. He gets his laser sharks by the third movie, though.
-   _Bait 3D_: A tsunami engulfs an Australian beach town, and a handful of survivors are trapped in an underground convenience store. Then they discover that a great white shark is there with them, which starts picking them off one by one.
-   _Batman: The Movie_: While investigating a yacht at sea, Batman is attacked by a shark. After he uses Bat Shark Repellent to make it let go of him, it falls into the water and explodes: one of the villains had planted a bomb in it.
-   _The Beach_: In this film, the seemingly idyllic youth community is revealed to be anything but when one of the members is gored by a shark.
-   The titular creature of _The Black Demon_ is no ordinary great white or tiger shark. It is a megalodon Animalistic Abomination set on attacking the stranded occupants of an offshore oil rig.
-   _Blue Water, White Death_: This 1971 documentary, for its name alone.
-   _Cyclone (1978)_: Zigzagged. Sharks show up three times in the 118 minute movie. The first time, one of them kills a man with injured legs who is drifting in the water but leaves everyone else alone. The second time, the survivors fish for the shark for food and injure it with their hook. When one of them falls into the water, he's in a hurry to get back aboard before the shark goes after him, but it doesn't seem to go after him. In the final scene, though, a school of sharks attack the drifting characters who are awaiting rescue and kill several of them even though none of them are bleeding at first.
-   _Dam Sharks_: A ferocious coastal storm sweeps several dozen bull sharks far upstream into a wildlife park, where for some reason they start emulating beavers by both hunting as a pack and building dams made up of equal parts floating logs and bodyparts from their kills as a combination of water trap and food locker. The fact that this kind of behavior has **no** precedent in reality is actually lampshaded, but the film never explains it.
-   _Dark Tide 2012_: Features great white sharks
-   _Deep Blue Sea_: The only thing worse than sharks? _Super-intelligent_ sharks. The scientists were extracting some kind of fluid from the sharks' brains for their research. They genetically modified them to grow larger brains so they could extract more fluid. Of course, larger brains also meant smarter sharks. Most notable is how the character played by none other than _Samuel L. Jackson_ is eaten by one of these sharks _while indoors_. Notably, the sharks were explicitly mentioned to be mutated makos and not great whites.
-   _Deep Blue Sea 2_: Seems to follow the trend set by its predecessor, featuring mutated bull sharks instead of makos.
-   The second sequel, _Deep Blue Sea 3_, plays this straight with the genetically-engineered offspring of the previous film's shark. Interestingly, the film portrays this trio as unnaturally aggressive, while the ordinary sharks living in the area are accurately portrayed as animals with little interest in human divers. Then there is "Sally", a large female Great White the protagonist has spent years studying — while she makes a threatening dominance display at the beginning of the film, Sally later ends up saving Emma from an attacker.
-   _Devil Fish_ is a bizarre aversion: The film seems to be aiming for this trope (it was originally titled _Shark — Rosso nell'oceano_ and elsewhere _Monster Shark_) but fails seemingly due to the filmmakers' ignorance about what a shark _is_.
-   _Flipper_: The 1996 film features Scar, a ferocious Great Hammerhead (the largest variety of hammerhead shark) who lurks in the area, is rumored to have taken out a tourist boat, and shows up during the climax to threaten Sandy. Fortunately, Flipper (with help from his pod) is able to drive him away in time.
-   _Ghost Shark_: The ghost of a great white shark. That can appear in any body of water, no matter the size.
-   _Great White_: After the seaplane is sunk, the five passengers are stranded in a life raft being circled by a giant great white shark.
-   _Hello Down There_: A group of sharks menace the underwater house at one point, although they aren’t portrayed as being deliberately predatory. They are attracted by the trash the family dumps (the film was made before most environmental regulations), and when Fred tries to divert them away by spraying a shark-attracting chemical nearby, the current carries it back to the house and the sharks follow.
-   In _Invention for Destruction_, one of the Submarine Pirates is taken by a shark while looting the sunken merchantman in a diving suit.
-   _James Bond_
    -   Movies with a Shark Pool: _Thunderball_, _Live and Let Die_, _The Spy Who Loved Me_, _Licence to Kill_...
    -   In _For Your Eyes Only_, Bond and Melina are keelhauled by the Big Bad as bait for prowling tiger sharks. One of his own mooks gets eaten instead which doesn't bother him much. Fortunately he thinks the sharks have taken care of Bond and Melina as well, when they actually escaped.
    -   And in _Never Say Never Again_, SPECTRE villainess Fatima Blush plants a homing device on James Bond that will summon sharks to attack him.
-   _Jaws_ is the Trope Codifier, to the point that it has inspired hundreds of attempts to capitalize off its critical acclaim and blockbuster status. Impressionable audiences feared it enough to significantly lower beach attendance that summer. Unfortunately, the film is often incorrectly blamed for inducing _a Real Life, war of extermination against all sharks_, but in truth, shark populations were drastically declining for completely different reasons well before this movie was made. Though efforts have been done to reduce the stigma that is levied against sharks, the initial war upon a keystone species made the original writer, Peter Benchley, denounce the film as an old shame. He often stated in later years that he could never again write a book like _Jaws_, and he devoted much of his post-Jaws career to ocean conservation.
    -   Needless to say, the sequels to _Jaws_ all play this trope straight to ridiculous effect.
-   _Jersey Shore Shark Attack_: a parody of the TV series _Jersey Shore_... with sharks added. It has nothing to do with the actual Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 that inspired _Jaws_.
-   _Juan of the Dead_: Inverted; a shark _saves_ Juan and Lázaro from a zombie threatening them. While they are on a raft, a zombie tries to reach them but a shark snatches the zombie and swims off.
-   _Jumper_: One of the Jumpers, a.k.a Flashy Teleporters, assassinates the Paladins by dumping them at sea surrounded by sharks.
-   In _Lady in Cement_, sharks start circling the scuba diving Tony just as he finds Sandra Lomax's corpse in her Cement Shoes.
-   _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider_: Subverted/parodied in the second movie, where being surrounded by sharks, Lara Croft punches one in the nose and proceeds to ride it to the surface.
-   _Lethal Weapon 4_: Has caught a small shark (alive) while out fishing with the heroes. When their boat sinks, the shark escapes; rather than booking it for the horizon, as any sensible animal would do, its fin is shown lingering near the swimming characters to add menace to the scene.
-   _Le Magnifique_: This French movie, a parody of spy flicks, begins with a spy character "eaten by a shark while in a phone booth." Yes, that's how it is actually described in the movie. To be more specific, the phone booth was lifted up by a helicopter with the spy inside, dropped into the sea, and then a caged shark was freed to attack him while still in the phone booth. Hard to top as a needlessly complicated execution method...
-   _Mako (2021)_: The main obstacle that the film crew faces in the movie is the Mako shark that's swimming in the vicinity of the Salem Express shipwreck. By the end of the movie, it's taken the lives of five of them.
-   _Mako The Jaws Of Death_: A telepath uses sharks to kill anyone who threatens the sharks themselves.
-   _Malibu Shark Attack_: Combined Disaster Movie (tsunami) with shark film. Also a case of Somewhere An Ichthyologist Is Crying, as real goblin sharks are sluggish, flabby-muscled wimps by shark standards.
-   _The Meg_: How do you top a Great White? With an even bigger prehistoric shark awakened from the bottom of the ocean! One poster<small>◊</small> homaging _Jaws_ had the shark coming up under the swimmer getting chased by an even _bigger_ shark behind it.
-   _My Super Ex-Girlfriend_: The title ex-girlfriend throws a shark at the protagonist. The protagonist is _in his new girlfriend's bedroom_ at the time. Several stories up in an apartment building.
-   _Open Water_: The first film, anyway. Double subversion, since nothing bad happens the _first_ time a shark appears. The problem is later when it, presumably, gets curious and comes back... with _friends_. From then on, it just gets worse. Also notable is the fact that not only are the sharks all real (even the ones interacting with the actors) but are all species one would have a reasonably good chance of encountering in Real Life, compared to, say, the more-famous-but-rarer great white.
    -   The third film has the imperiled protagonists on a shark-watching trip. Their boat capsizes, and thanks to all the chum that their tour guides threw in the water to attract the sharks, they now have to contend with a myriad of them hovering around.
-   The TV-movie adaptation of _Peter Benchley's Creature_ changed the title creature from a man-turned-Nazi weapon with metal teeth and claws into an American military-made bipedal great white shark.
-   _The Phantom (1996)_: The Sengh Brotherhood's secret base is in shark-infested water.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean_ has a few sharks swimming around some shipwrecks in the first movie; Maccus, Davy Jones' first mate from the second and third movie, is a Shark Man; and in the fifth movie, the antagonists keep a brace of _undead_ sharks on their ship and sic them on their enemies.
-   _Planet of the Sharks_ and its continuation _Empire of the Sharks_ are Asylum\-made copycats of _Waterworld_. So how to make them legally distinct from the original (aside from the lower budget)? Have sharks proliferate up the wazoo after the planet floods and give the Wasteland Warlord and the Mysterious Waif who composites the Mariner and Enola the power to control them.
-   The _Police Story_ spinoff, _First Strike_, has Jackie Chan fighting enemy mooks which inevitably leads to the interior of an aquarium's shark tank. Chan and the mook he's fighting spends most of the underwater battle trying to cut each other to lure the shark into eating one another, but luckily neither men ends up being devoured as they both got out and continues fighting on land.
-   _The Reef_: This Aussie film features four tourists forced to swim to an island ten miles away when their boat capsizes. Through a known shark zone. And yes, they do encounter great white sharks.
-   _Revolution (2012)_: Averted Trope. Rob Stewart and an assistant are in the water with sharks at the start of the Documentary and nothing bad happens to them.
-   _Sand Sharks_. A bunch of armored demonic-looking sharks that breathe air and swim through sand terrorizes a cliffside beach.
-   Syfy, née the Sci-Fi Channel (you could almost say that this is a regular monster in films made by The Asylum):
    -   There have been times when this network has shown several movies of sharks attacking people back to back. Megalodons (giant prehistoric sharks) are quite often involved, e.g.. _Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus_.
    -   Incidentally, if the title has _Shark vs._ anything, it's probably by Asylum — if they make anything that isn't a Mockbuster or a bad Christian flick, it's a giant shark fighting something else equally nasty.
    -   Mega Shark has returned to face off against another giant prehistoric predator: Crocosaurus.
-   Blake Lively finds herself menaced by a shark in _The Shallows_. It's later indicated that the aggressive great white in question has a bad history with humans, given the spear fragment lodged in its mouth.
-   _Shark Attack_: A freak record of shark attacks are plaguing a South African fishing town. It does vary it a bit, showing other species such as Tiger Sharks and Makos besides the familiar Great White.
-   _Shark Attack 3: Megalodon_: Which, of course, features a megalodon.
-   _Sharknado_: It's a tornado... carrying tons of sharks.
-   _Sharknado 2: The Second One_: It's a _blizzard_ tornado... carrying tons of sharks.
-   _Shark Night 3D_: Obviously centers on this trope. A group of college students spends a weekend at a lake which has inexplicably become home to various man-eating species of sharks. The kicker? The sharks were supplied by a couple of rednecks who want to cash in on the Discovery Channel's Shark Week craze...by feeding college students to the sharks, and recording video footage of the attacks to post online, sell to various channels, etc.
-   _Sharktopus_: Combines this with Tentacled Terror.
-   _Shark Week_: This Asylum-produced film combines _Jaws_ with _Saw_.
-   _Soul Surfer_: Based on a True Story. Young surfer Bethany Hamilton almost bleeds to death when a tiger shark bites off her left arm, but she survives and learns to surf extremely well with only one arm.
-   _Spring Break Shark Attack_: This Made-for-TV low-budget-gore-fest. Exactly What It Says on the Tin: attractive coeds in bathing suits and sharks.
-   _The Suicide Squad_ has Nanaue, aka King Shark, a simple-minded but extremely lethal man/shark hybrid descended from an ancient shark god who likes to kill his enemies by eating them. Physically, he is easily the toughest member of the Suicide Squad in the film, able to withstand a ton of gunfire and get back up, and also the most dangerous in hand-to-hand combat.
-   _Super Shark_ features a giant walking, flying shark. And a Walking Tank.
-   _Swamp Shark_: A mutant shark with the ability to breathe fresh water and covered in crocodile-like scales terrorizes a swamp.
-   _Toxic Shark_: A tropical island resort set up as a singles retreat is attacked by a mutated shark that has become a Poisonous Person after coming into contact with some toxic waste (well, it's _presumed_, no explanation for its mutations are ever given in the movie). The titular Toxic Shark is covered in a poisonous slime, supposedly arsenic based, which will eventually drive anyone grazed by its skin or bitten by it and surviving into a murderous lunatic whose bites spread the same madness, so you get a Threatening Shark _and_ a Technically Living Zombie outbreak at the same time. It's also grown a "horn" from which it can spray the slime, causing it to burn like acid.
-   In _Team America: World Police_, Kim Jong Il has a Shark Pool full of man-eating sharks, played by live dogfish that are bigger than the human marionettes.
-   _Undercover Brother_: At the end, Mr. Feather falls from a helicopter and chomped by a shark just before falling into the ocean.
-   _Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea_
    -   A frogman kills a shark just for swimming near them, on the presumption that it's going to attack. It's a carpenter shark, which tend not to harm humans unless threatened.
    -   Zigzagged when a scientist on board the _Seaview_, which is large enough to have its own Shark Pool for marine research, is shown in the pool with the shark 'walking' it around the pool so it won't drown after being drugged for a medical examination. Later the trope is played straight when someone falls into the pool and is eaten by the now fully conscious shark.
-   _Yellowbeard_: This pirate comedy plays with this when the title character's wife is taken captive by the Royal Navy and pumped for information offscreen; when she's ready to talk, she says, "I think it was that shark that jogged my memory." "The Shark" is the handsome sailor (David Bowie in a cameo) who brings her into the office, who has a shark's fin strapped to his back; he "jogged her memory" via sex.
-   _Zombi 2_: This Lucio Fulci film has a shark fighting a zombie. It's a draw.

    Gamebooks 

-   The _Fighting Fantasy_ series of books seems to contain hostile sharks in any maritime-inspired adventure.
    -   _Demons of the Deep_ is an adventure where you get to explore Atlantis after landing in an underwater Magic Circle allowing you to breathe.

-   _Appointment with F.E.A.R._, which have you playing the role of a superhero, contains a scenario where you stop a shark attack on a crowded beach, in a blatant _Jaws_ Shout-Out. Think of it as, "What if a superhero is present in _Jaws_ during one of those shark attacks?"

    Literature 

-   At one point in _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_, Captain Nemo invites Professor Arronax on an underwater stroll to visit a pearl fishery, and **then** mentions the prospect of sharks. This makes the professor quite nervous: "So there I was, daydreaming about sharks capable of cutting a man in two with their row upon row of teeth. I could already feel a pain in my side." Talking to his friends a few minutes later, he accidentally speaks of "a hundred and fifty sharks" instead of "a hundred and fifty pearls."
    
    _I slept rather badly. Sharks played an important role in my dreams._
    
-   In the original novel _The Adventures of Pinocchio_, the giant sea creature that swallows Pinocchio and Geppetto is not a whale but a "Terrible Dogfish". "Dogfish" is a literal translation of "pescecane", the Italian term for sharks.
-   _Animorphs_
    -   This trope is invoked as early as the fourth book. That's when the kids morph dolphin and end up on the wrong end of a battle with sharks, leaving Marco almost bitten in half. Dealing with the intrinsic fear of sharks the experience left him with is a major plot point in _The Escape_.
    -   In _The Escape_, the fifteenth book in the series, it is revealed that Yeerks have established an underwater base where they capture hammerhead sharks and implant brain-controlling chips in their heads to turn them into shock troopers for an invasion of an alien aquatic world inhabited by psychic man-frogs... The brain-controlling chips are mostly intended to make them smarter... smart enough to hunt in packs like wolves do. Also to enlarge their earholes for even more convenient brain control. The Animorphs later go to said alien world morphed into hammerheads themselves. It proves to be an inspired choice.
-   Subverted in Sergey Volnov's _Army Of The Sun_, where sharks and whales have been artificially given intelligence and develop Psychic Powers. The sharks actually become deeply philosophical, benign creatures, able to open portals from one planet to another, as long as both feature large bodies of seawater.
-   Mr. Shark in _The Bad Guys_ book series is considered a dangerous villain, known for eating anyone and anything in sight. He's considered such a threat that his case file hardly even has any info on it, and has the biggest warning out of the others. Despite this, he's still hired on by Mr. Wolf to pull a change to good, much to his confusion and irritation. Despite this, he goes through with the change in earnest, possibly one of the more earnest ones in the group, and ends up as one of the most sensitive members of the group.
-   In _Balefire_ by Ken Goddard, a terrorist is planning to infiltrate the United States by swimming from a cargo ship, which is being followed by a shark feeding off the garbage thrown from the vessel. At first, the terrorist is amused by the shark and even feeds it to stave off the boredom of the voyage, but as the time for his infiltration grows near he realises that the shark is being conditioned to regard anything thrown overboard as food. He becomes increasingly paranoid as the shark keeps following them even after he orders the crew to stop disposing of their garbage, and eventually has to resort to shooting it.
-   _Bruce Coville's Book of... Ghosts II_: A _ghost_ shark is featured in _Shark!_.
-   _Codex Alera_
    -   Subverted when Captain Demos mentions that sharks are likely to be more of a problem to a group of swimmers than leviathans... But when a shark messes with Isana, she _throws it bodily out of the water and up twenty feet onto the deck of a pirate ship_.
    -   Played straight before that when Tavi had his army dump the blood and guts from butchered animals in the river when he was defending a bridge, attracting sharks from miles downstream and ensuring that any Canim attempting to swim around the bridge wouldn't make it very far.
-   In _The Coral Island_, the castaways paddle out into the lagoon on a log to fish, only to find themselves pursued by a shark. They briefly distract it by throwing the fish they've caught at it. Then Jack beats it off with a paddle, upsetting the log and dumping the three of them into the water. By that point they're close enough to swim to shore before the shark gets close to them again, but they never venture into the lagoon again until they've built a proper boat.
-   The finale of _Deception Point_ takes place on a marine biologist's rig over a massive swarm of sharks. Some baddies do find their way in, naturally.
-   Cretaceous-era sharks in _Dinoverse_ cause some apprehension — Janine notices an Ischyrhizz and thinks "Oh, good. A killing machine with a Ginsu knife attachment. Mother Nature must have been in a funny mood when she came up with that one" — but the real danger is from the Elasmosaurus and Mososaurus lurking in that same ocean, picking off said sharks when the whim takes them.
-   _Discworld_
    -   In Terry Pratchett's _The Last Continent_, the wizards, out at sea, see one. One wizard starts to burble about how they are maligned and list all their wonderful attributes. Unfortunately, it's the list about wolves, not sharks.
    -   At the beginning of _Interesting Times_, a shark tries to attack Rincewind, but is eaten by the Luggage.
    -   _Jingo_: "Vimes's grin was as funny as the one that moves very fast towards drowning men. And has a fin on top."
-   _Dive (2003)_: Zigzagged. When Kaz sees a shark on his first dive, he panics, stabs it, and is promptly rebuked for doing so, with Captain Vanover lambasting _Jaws_ for creating a negative stereotype of animals who will swim past divers without a moment of aggression unless there's already blood in the water. However, whenever there _is_ blood in the water, an eighteen-foot tiger shark nicknamed Clarence is willing to hungrily lunge at the heroes while displaying a wide maw of teeth.
-   _Gentleman Bastard_. Sharks turn up repeatedly in _The Lies of Locke Lamora_: the city of Camorr features Gladiator Games where female gladiators fight them, and Camorr's top crime boss employs a Shark Pool when the need arises. The Big Bad begins a final overthrow of said crime boss by having a shark (being controlled by magic) jump out of the pool and bite his arm off.

-   Invoked with Scarface the Shark Man in _Heart of Steel_, whose job it is to patrol the waters around Shark Reef Isle for potential intruders. Of course, his creator, Alistair Mechanus, thinks that he's an absolute sweetheart.
-   _James and the Giant Peach_: The peach is attacked by sharks when floating on the sea, causing the frightened crew to escape by lifting the peach into the air with hundreds of seagulls. Later, they are surprised to discover that the sharks have hardly damaged the peach at all, which is explained in the narrative about sharks having a mouth awkwardly set back under their long nose.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   Felix Leiter in _Live and Let Die_ is captured by the bad guys, who proceed to lower him into the pool with a hungry shark, which bites off a hand and a leg from him. Later Bond must swim to the Big Bad's Island Base which is surrounded by sharks, but he's more concerned about barracudas because he knows sharks typically don't attack people of their own accord. Turns out the villains throw blood and offal into the water every night to send them into a feeding frenzy.
    -   As Bond swims his way to the secret island base of the Nebulous Evil Organization SPECTRE in _Nobody Lives for Ever_, he is chased to the ground by a bull shark which he happens to come by.
-   _Jaws_, the original book by Peter Benchley. Benchley also wrote _White Shark_ (later re-titled _Peter Benchley's Creature_), about a genetically engineered Half-Human Hybrid Nazi shark.

-   _Killer Sharks The Real Story_ is a 1977 book by 'Captain' Brad Matthews with an unforgettable cover of a screaming bathing beauty being swept into the bloody toothed maw of a shark. Supposedly written by a survivor of the USS Indianapolis whose experience caused him to dedicate his life to the study of sharks, it's actually Based on a Great Big Lie by novelist Nelson DeMille to cash in on _Jaws_.

-   _The Mermaid Chronicles_: When Cordelia was thirteen, she lost her mother and brother to a shark attack.

-   Leviathan in _My Vampire Older Sister and Zombie Little Sister_ is a demon lord in the form of a 30 metre<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  long shark. It is even stronger than expected from its size, capable of casually destroying buildings by ramming them and jumping several stories into the air. On top of that, it has telepathic powers that it can use to paralyze people or to forcibly draw them into an alternate dimension with a five storey-deep flood, giving itself the home field advantage.
-   In _Nation_, sharks are practically the personification of From Bad to Worse:
    -   While rescuing a drowning man — in the middle of a very surprising discovery — Mau is forced to confront a hungry shark. He wins, too.
    -   First Mate Cox would almost certainly have died from that axe in his chest, but just to be sure he gets eaten by sharks, too.

-   In _The Princess Bride_, when Buttercup tries to swim away from the ship, Vizzini warns her that, unless she comes back immediately, he will cut his arms and legs and draw blood into a cup and throw it into the water "and sharks can smell blood in the water for miles and you won't be beautiful for long." She doesn't, he does, the sharks go mad, and the narrator interrupts to say that, of course, Buttercup doesn't get eaten at that time. (The movie replaced the sharks with shrieking eels.)
-   _The Raw Shark Texts_ by Steven Hall features a "purely conceptual" shark that swims through memes, eating memories and identities.

-   _Redwall_
    -   Sharks often show up during the seafaring scenes. In _The Bellmaker_, Finbarr Galedeep sings a silly song about sharks, and later that evening a very worried Rufe Brush comes and asks him what a shark looks like. He tells him that mostly all you'll see is a big pointy fin, to which Rufe responds "Does it look like this one circling our ship, sir?"
    -   And in _Triss_, Krrova, Scarum, and Saxtus run across a shark at least _twice_.
-   _Rip Tide 1984_, a novel by Donald Cheatham, involves a 26-foot tiger shark stalking Florida shores. Halfway through the focus of the novel switches to an incoming hurricane which dramatically increases the death quotient, with the shark only a bit player.

-   In _Star Island_, Bang Abbott lured a pack of hungry lemon sharks to a crowded beach so he could take a lucrative photograph of the ensuing mayhem. The discovery of his unethical scheme forced him out of newspapers and into tabloid photography, where he shows similar poor judgment.
-   In his essay "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again" (collected in an anthology of the same name and about a luxury Caribbean cruise he had taken to report on for _Harper's_), David Foster Wallace goes on an extended tangent about his horror of and fascination with sharks, detailing his boyhood obsession with shark attacks (including an extensive knowledge of the attacks on the survivors of the sinking of USS _Indianapolis_) and how crazy it was to see _Jaws_ when he was 13. He also tries to lure sharks to swim by the ship, to no avail.
-   _The Syrena Legacy_: Early in _Of Poseidon_, Emma's best friend Chloe is attacked by a shark, which tries to drag her away. Emma fights the shark for several minutes, to no avail. Eventually Emma, not knowing about her abilities, yells "Stop!" and the shark swims away, but by that point Chloe is dead.
-   In the _Tempest (2011)_ trilogy, sharks usually leave merpeople alone, but while Tempest is swimming with a wounded tail in _Tempest Unleashed_, a shark smells her blood and starts circling her. Tempest doesn't have the strength for another fight. Fortunately for her, when the shark brushes against her it gets frightened by her magic power and swims away.
-   In _The Vazula Chronicles_, the magical boundary of the triple kingdoms keeps predators out, but merpeople who venture into the open ocean often have to dodge or fight off sharks. Merletta always carries a stone weapon, and later a spear, whenever she leaves the triple kingdoms.
-   The second _Young Wizards_ novel has a ninety-foot long shark as a _major character_. While he doesn't make things worse for the good guys, he definitely makes things worse for the bad guys. However, he still scares the crap out of his allies, because he will eat anything that's in distress, including his friends. Note that he's not a great white: he's older than that SPECIES of shark, considering that, you know, he was the original shark to accept the first Silent One's sacrifice.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Subverted in _Australian Wilderness with Ray Mears_ when Ray goes scuba diving and spends some time swimming alongside a young whale shark.

-   In the _Doctor Who_ episode "A Christmas Carol", the Doctor and young Kazran nearly get eaten by a shark (that swims in the fog). Subverted in that the shark apparently isn't as vicious as it seems: the Doctor, in true Cloudcuckoolander fashion, harnesses it to a flying sleigh and goes for a joyride.

This show's version of Driven to Suicide has Cleo swim into the middle of a known shark breeding ground (don't worry, she lives). Another episode has Rikki deciding to enter a short film competition about heroes and make the film about sharks. Because she is a mermaid she is able to get much closer to sharks in their natural habitat with a camera than professionals (she can't use the footage however for the same reasons). When Zane runs into sharks Rikki simply uses her powers to heat up the water and scare them off.
-   That episode of _Happy Days_. You know the one. Not dangerous for the characters, but the show got wounded pretty bad.

-   In the _Haven_ episode "Over My Head", a woman named Daphne is trapped in a crashed car at low tide, while a shark circles and waits for the tide to rise so it can reach her.

-   _The I-Land_: The waters around the island are populated with sharks, which almost kill some of the stranded people when they go out for a swim.
-   _The Jeff Corwin Experience_: As Jeff Corwin oh so eloquently explained about any sane animal's reaction to this trope: "If you wanna get them all out of the water and onto the beach all you gotta do is go like this...SHARK! SHARK!"
-   "Adrift", the second episode of _Lost_'s second season, features Michael and Sawyer stuck on tiny remnants of their exploded raft. Sawyer's gunshot wound eventually attracts a shark, because of course floating in the middle of the ocean on scraps of bamboo isn't jeopardy enough! At one point, Sawyer tries to get from one raft to another, with the shark nearby, which may have been a play on the phrase Jump the Shark.

    **Tracy Jordan:** Live every week like it's Shark Week.

-   In an episode of _Psych_, the Victim of the Week appears to have been killed by a shark. As it turned out, this shark was framed.
-   Chevy Chase's "Land Shark" sketches on _Saturday Night Live_.
    
    "Candygram!"
    
-   _Shark Tank_ (known in other countries as _Dragons' Den_) uses shark imagery to represent how ruthless the investors are.
-   _The Six Million Dollar Man_ episode "Sharks". A villain group has learned how to train and control sharks.
-   Shows up in the occasional Monster of the Week in _Super Sentai_ and _Power Rangers_, but subverted as often as not when there's a shark among the heroes:
    -   _Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger_/_Power Rangers Wild Force_ and _Tensou Sentai Goseiger_/_Power Rangers Megaforce_ each have a shark-themed Blue Ranger and an additional hammerhead mecha.
    -   _Juken Sentai Gekiranger_/_Power Rangers Jungle Fury_ gives the Red Ranger some shark gear. _Gekiranger_ also has Sharkie Chan, a Shark Man who knows martial arts, although he's one of the good guys and actually really friendly all around. In _Jungle Fury_, we are introduced to the American exclusive Spirit Rangers, one of which is a Shark Ranger.
    -   The shark-like Sandaaru of _Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger_ is the most powerful of the Seven Dark Spears who serve Tau Zant and the most ruthless of them, destroying an entire planet to gain a single artifact and backstabbing Tau Zant in the finale. His counterpart in _Power Rangers Ninja Storm_ Vexacus was no less menacing.
    -   _Power Rangers Samurai_ has a shark-themed upgrade. (It was originally a dinosaur in _Samurai Sentai Shinkenger_, but the US production did some tweaking.)
    -   One of the toughest Monsters of the Week in _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ was called the "Slippery Shark".
    -   The shark-based monster Sogizarai from episode 36 of _Samurai Sentai Shinkenger_ may be a Monster of the Week like usual, but his Spin Attack delivers a very brutal beatdown within that brief time. One hero gets sent sliding across the floor _after his weapon is smashed._
    -   _Doubutsu Sentai Zyuohger_ has a female shark-themed blue ranger named Sela (derived from "selachos", or "shark" in ancient Greek), whose title is "Monarch of the rough seas". And due to being a Zyuman, her true form is even a Shark Woman.
    -   _Avataro Sentai Donbrothers_ has Don Murasame, a sentient sword that follows the commands of "Mother", who is themed on a shark. He starts off as an antagonist before the final episode, where he joins the Donbrothers.
-   The _Ultra Series_ has its share of shark-based water kaiju:
    -   Samekujira is the last monster from _Ultraman Taro_ and a kaiju-sized alien shark-whale brought to earth by an alien invader named Valky. It can travel on land, however, as well as having traits borrowed from sawfish in it's beak.
    -   _Ultraman Tiga_ has a Land Shark monster called a Geozark, who spends most of the episode drilling throughout the city with it's fin being the only part of the monster that's visible. Subverted when it turns out to be a tunnelling robot created by Keigo Masaki.
    -   Ultraman Belial is meant to resemble a shark, with his sharp head crest and dorsal fin, mouth full of sharp teeth and black, muscular body.
    -   Genegarg from _Ultraman Z_ is based on a tiger shark (even bearing the Boss Subtitles "Ferocious Space Shark"!) and like real-life tiger sharks, would gladly chomp on and swallow literally _everything_ in its way, including another monster called Bullton. It's especially threatening since it's heavily implied to be a bioweapon Celebro obtained from a previous Civilization Self-Destruction Game.
-   The _Walking With..._ series frequently subvert this by placing sharks alongside even scarier predators:
    -   _Walking with Dinosaurs_. During "Cruel Sea", there are plenty of sharks (called Hybodus) about, but they aren't the top predator. That would be _Liopleurodon_, one of the few creatures that is proven to _always_ make things even worse than they are with sharks. How much worse? Try 21 ft aquatic reptilian killing machine with a combined jaw size of just under 9.5 ft. Run.
    -   _Walking with Beasts_ depicts sharks as being outclassed by larger marine predators as well. A group of sharks hunting in the shallows at the northern edge of the Tethys Ocean flee in terror from a hungry _Basilosaurus_, a prehistoric 50 ft killer whale.
    -   _Walking with Monsters_: In the first time period that sharks show up, they are playing second fiddle to the much larger carnivorous fish _Hyneria_. One of them is Swallowed Whole by the larger predator.
    -   _Sea Monsters_ has sharks as well. _Stethacanthus_ in the Devonian barely even registers as a threat. There's also the obligatory _Megalodon_ in the Pliocene. (For reference, the babies are the size of an adult Great White.) The Jurassic still has _Hybodus_, and the Cretaceous has more sharks that barely register as a threat. There are also _Xiphactinus_ (a.k.a. The Ugliest Fish in History) and giant mosasaurs, just to make the sharks look irrelevant.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Averted in Pacific Mythology, in which the sea gods are usually portrayed as benevolent shark-shaped guardians of the sea. Examples include Ukupanipo, Kamohoalii, and Dakuwaqa. Hawaiian mythology goes one step further and refers to tiger sharks as "na 'aumakua", benevolent ancestor spirits.
-   Stories of "weresharks" appear in a number of South Pacific cultures. A good example is Nanaue in Hawaiian legend, the son of the aforementioned Kamohoalii and a woman named Kalei. He was born with a shark's mouth on his back and the ability to become a shark upon entering water, so his father warned Kalei that not to feed him any red meat. The taboo was unwittingly broken by his uncle, giving Nanaue an appetite for human flesh as a result. King Shark of DC Comics is directly based on him.
-   By contrast, sharks in Japanese mythology are more malicious. The description of a shark monster in the _Ehon Hyaku Monogatari_ is probably the oldest description of a shark ambushing people like in modern media.
    -   A Youkai known as the Isonade is described as a colossal shark covered in hooked spikes that it uses to shred ships open and impale unlucky sailors. Despite their size, they're very hard to notice, and you'll probably only get a glimpse of its tail before it vanishes beneath the waves.
-   Inuit Mythology records attacks of Greenland sharks on kayaks, which would be exceptional considering this species is not known to attack humans. However, they are also part of Sedna's entourage of creatures, and thus properly honored as vital for the people's survival.

    Pinball 

-   In the "Walk the Plank" Video Mode in _Black Rose_, the player must use Button Mash to outswim a shark.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Garbage Wrestler Shark Tsuchiya from FMW.
-   John Tenta was billed as the Shark as a member of the Dungeon of Doom in WCW from June 1995 until Big Bubba shaved off half of Tenta's hair to kick him out of the group in June 1996. His ring gear had a shark design and he had shark "teeth" painted onto his beard. His Finishing Move was a running clothesline called the Shark Attack, and he would sometimes "bite" his opponents.
-   Heartland Wrestling Association's El Piranha became Shark Boy when he was called up by WCW. He had a toothed mask and would get stuck to those he bit.
-   Jawsolyn was an Affectionate Parody of the Trope Codifier and the trope in general.

    Roleplay 

-   _Destroy the Godmodder_: A large swarm of flying sharks was summoned to take down a rogue team member hiding beneath a giant pile of fish in the tvtropes session. Needless to say, it did not go as planned.

    Sports 

-   There are a number of teams that have sharks in their name or use sharks as their mascot, including the NHL's San Jose Sharks, arena football's Jacksonville Sharks, and the Chinese Basketball Association's Shanghai Sharks. How 'threatening' they are depends on how their season is going.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _BattleTech_:
    -   Minor historical tidbit: The totemic animal of Clan Sea Fox got all but wiped out by a new predator introduced into its native oceans by a rival Clan. The Sea Foxes turned insult into opportunity and simply adopted said predator as their _new_ totem instead; today, they're known as Clan Diamond Shark. The Diamond Sharks somewhat subvert this, however; they generally would rather do business with you than fight you and treat their civilians well by Clan standards.
    -   The Rim Worlds Republic played it straight; their government was often brutal and they eventually gave rise to an Evil Chancellor who would destroy the Star League and plunge human space into 300 years of war. The symbol of the RWR? A shark.
-   _Call of Cthulhu_ has the Father of All Sharks, a rarely-seen avatar of Cthulhu that takes the form of an absolutely enormous (dwarfing even a megalodon) and extraordinarily aggressive shark.
-   _CthulhuTech_ has megalodons, big enough to be a threat to aquatic Humongous Mecha.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_
    -   The monster called the bulette, better known as the "land shark", is an aggressive predator that burrows through the soil, complete with fin cutting through the surface of the _ground_ as it burrows toward you.
    -   _D&D_ also has sharks that live in acid and lava. Because even when you're drowning in acid or lava, sometimes it's just too easy. The monster entry for the acid-breathing shark sums it up pretty well: "What's worse than a pit full of acid? A pit full of acid with a shark in it."
    -   It also has regular sharks, the megalodon (giant prehistoric shark), and weresharks.
    -   The sahuagin are sometimes depicted as humanoid sharks, and their patron deity Sekolat takes the form of a giant shark.
    -   The terlen is a shark-like creature found across the Lower Planes, with elongated fins that allow it to fly, or even wriggle across dry land in pursuit of prey. Their _Planescape_ entry notes that terlens' shark ancestors were hardy and dangerous enough to thrive in the worst waters of the multiverse _before_ they were mutated into amphibious predators.
-   _Exalted_: Benthic knifeooths are sharks up to twenty feet long and with slender, serpentine bodies. They get their name from their wickedly serrated teeth, which snag in the flesh of their prey — which translates to almost anything smaller than themselves — to prevent it from escaping. Luckily, they live in the very deep ocean and far from human settlement. Less luckily, there are plenty of things in Creation, ranging from idle curiosity on the shark's part to a sea god in a bad mood, that can drive one towards the shallows and into contact with humans.
-   _Fabula Ultima_: One of the core rulebook's sample bosses is the Thornshark, an enormous man-eating shark which can fly and spray damaging jets of water at its foes.
-   _Hero Clix_: The miniatures game set of Arkham Asylum has a figure of Black Manta, who while being a decent playing piece, is pushed into the category of awesome by having his sculpt feature him surfing on the head of a shark with a frikkin' laser beam on its head. Later on, we get a Black Lantern Aquaman, who can summon zombie sharks.
-   _Infernum_ has Obsidian Sharks, Spawn (a sort of proto-lifeform) that look like sharks made from living volcanic rock which swims through the seas and rivers of flame, magma and molten metal that flow just about everywhere in Hell. And, as Spawn, kill one, and more will promptly tear their way out of its carcass and attack you.
-   _Middle-Earth Role Playing_: Nímaeargyrth, or White Seadeaths (by their description, they're essentially great white sharks), are deadly predators that will hunt anything with meat on it, even taking wounded whales.
-   _Numenera_: Jybrils are sea monsters resembling titanic, monstrous sharks with three eyes in a row on each side of their heads. They will attack and eat anything they come across — humanoids, fish, other sea monsters, machines... — with the nanites living symbiotically in their tissues allowing them to digest all of it.
-   _Pirates Constructible Strategy Game_ introduced giant, boat-sized sharks as a new Sea Monster unit in the ninth set, "Ocean's Edge". They were the smallest of the sea monsters with only two segments, compared to the Sea Serpents with four and Kraken and Leviathan with five, and like most sea monsters were considered Awesome, but Impractical due to their fragility and inability to carry crew or cargo like normal ships.
-   In _Salvage Hidden Treasures_, the "Shark Attack!" event has sharks attacking the player and damaging their scuba gears, costing them either 500£ or one of their treasures if they can't afford it.
-   _Stormbringer_: In _Demon Magic_, the adventure "Sorcerer's Isle" had a megalodon that could sink ships by biting through their hulls.
-   _Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies_ has skysharks: "Horse-sized, arrow-shaped carnivores (little more than fanged mouths with wings)".
-   _Warhammer 40,000_ has the Carcharodons (or "Space Sharks") Space Marine Chapter, a Chapter of brutal and feared warriors that are rarely seen. And when they _are_, nothing is left living in their wake.
-   _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_; The Idoneth Deepkin use sharks called Allopexes as beasts of battle for their more elite warriors, who attack with various ranged weapons while the Allopex tears at opponents with its teeth and fins.
-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ has the Rokea, the weresharks. The Garou serve as Gaia's warriors on land, and the Rokea serve as her warriors at sea. Only since most of them spend all their time away from humanity, they seem a little... off.
-   _World of Synnibarr_, well-known for its flying bears with laser-beam eyes, also has sharks. Sharks with armor-penetrating teeth, and shapechanging abilities so they can climb aboard your ship.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_: Pridak is the leader of a group of Barraki warlords and an evil shark-man with an army of mutant Takea sharks and suspicious red markings around his mouth. This is the guy who destroyed a platoon of his own men for a minor infraction, gave the Big Bads reason to fear him, got Makuta thinking about taking over the universe, beat the crap out of his fellow Barraki (and everybody else) including ripping out Kalmah's eye and tearing off Nocturn's arm, and he threw Sarda to his army of sharks for mouthing off. He lived.
-   Car-eating sharks are often included in some Hot Wheels playsets.
-   LEGO's much earlier _Aquazone_ set-line had the classis Aquasharks as the villains for a time. The _CITY_ line also comes with sharks.
-   The _Tomy Ania Animal_ line has the "Great White Shark,"<small>◊</small> being an educational toy, it is photorealistic, highly articulated, and its jaw can open and chomp your action figures! The toy line also comes with the Whale Shark, except it's a Gentle Giant, and it's smaller than the Great White.
-   _Transformers_ has several examples:
    -   _Generation One_ had the Sharkticons, animalistic slaves/goons of the Quintessons, who kept a shark pit in their courtroom. Anyone who got put on trial ended up in the shark pit.
    -   Later on, there was Overbite of the Seacons, who turned into a shark with arms and legs.
    -   The _Universe_ toyline established a piece of Cybertronian wildlife known as the Oxide Sharks. _Beast Wars: Uprising_ expanded on them a little further — they can transform as well, in this case into torpedoes, aimed at anyone foolish enough to come near them.

    Visual Novels 

-   _South Scrimshaw_: The Penumbra Shark is described as the fastest predator in the oceans of Aria. It notably has a foldable dorsal fin like certain real-life sailfish that it can retract when it needs to swim faster. One Penumbra Shark ambushes the Calf's Brillo Whale pod as they are journeying across the open ocean at night. Another calf is gruesomely killed by the shark, while the protagonist Calf's mother dies from the exertion of defending him from the shark due to a preexisting parasitic infection. When, years later, the Calf sees a male Brillo Whale that has formed a symbiotic relationship with a group of Chowper sharks that are described as "stupid but friendly" and are visibly much smaller and less dangerous than the Penumbra Shark, the Calf is still too traumatized to go anywhere near them.
-   In _Tsukihime_, Shiki can get killed at one point by opening a door, while on land, to find a shark behind it (it's one of Nero Chaos's 666 familiars). The doorshark has become something of a meme among the fans.

    Web Animation 

-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Sushi is one of the most recurring threats in the series. He is a metal shark with large teeth and an incredible appetite.
-   Gawr Gura of _hololive_ subverts this. Despite being a Cute Monster Girl based on a shark, complete with Scary Teeth, she's a chipper and sweet-tempered Genki Girl whose ill will towards others is largely limited towards messing with them in cooperative gaming. Played straighter with her Evil Counterpart, Gawr, who was first mentioned in her Image Song and later manifested in an unarchived concert, though even this is a Downplayed Trope in that the worst she did was insulting the chat members watching her stream and finding the original Gura's "cheerful idol persona" to be grating.
-   _Homestar Runner_
    -   This is combined this with its land-bound cousin in the form of the Bear Holding A Shark. Really just a cardboard standee that pops out from behind Strong Bad's fence, but a valid meta-character all the same.
    -   And there is, of course, our resident parenting expert, Hungry Shark. He's gonna eat your kids.
-   _How to Kill a Mockingbird_: The pirates use flying, burning sharks as personal transports.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original

-   _Neopets:_
    -   The shark-like Jetsam neopet species was introduced as the Evil Counterpart to the innocent narwhal-like Flotsams, described as mostly unfriendly and vicious. The first major Jetsam character on the site, Spectre, first appeared as a minor plot antagonist before becoming the Final Boss of "Cheat!", a card game. Though the species's villainous depiction has considerably mellowed out after the site's early days, they still look always ready to start a fight. True to their predatory nature, they're the only species that can be fed petpets along with food<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
    -   Subverted with the Sharky petpet; the item description says that, though they look fierce, they don't have any teeth.
-   Rémi Gaillard parodied this.
-   The SCP Foundation's alternate universe counterpart, the Shark Punching Center,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  takes the threat of sharks _very_ seriously. There's two joke articles, SCP-3284-J and SCP-7475-J, an orientation transcript, and even a tiny wiki of its own.
    -   A more serious example is SCP-1057, which is literally a living blank space with the shape and behavior of a tiger shark.
-   The poster image for this page is a photo Urban Legend that's been floating around the Internet for a long time. It shows a diver climbing up a helicopter's rope ladder and a shark is jumping out of the water to eat him whole. It's fake.
-   Sharks clearly possess the ability to give you seizures.
-   Shark Pool naturally, with the shark... in a swimming pool.
-   Inverted in this video, in which a CGI baby shark is tickled. And acts entirely like an adorable puppy or kitten. It's so cute!
-   During the 2015-2016 flight around the world of the solar-powered ''Solar Impulse 2'' airplane, there was a parody Twitter account documenting a shark named Joe who was chasing the plane in the hopes that it would crash in the ocean and he could eat the pilots. As the account was run by the plane's PR team, Joe was more of an Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain than anything else, and the account's last tweets had him make a Heel–Face Turn and decide to help the pilots promote renewable energy instead.
-   _Life Around a Red Dwarf_: The Loricatorumstomads are the Nuskun equivalent, being apex aquatic predators with sleek bodies and sharp teeth. They're still Starfish Aliens, though, so they differ by having, among other things, vertically-oriented jaws, Extra Eyes located near the ends of said jaws, and a chitinous exoskeleton.
-   Beware! It's the Shark Attack Cupcake ... Mountain?

    Western Animation 

-   _Aladdin: The Series_
    -   Two episodes deal with a gigantic, shark-like beast that swims through sand like water and has a fortune of treasures pressed into its underside. In the first episode, it attacks Agrabah and Aladdin and friends join with a hunter who had been after the shark for years, and they succeeded in driving it off. In the second episode, the shark is slain by a race of Ewok-like desert hunters working for an evil wizard, but Aladdin and the hunter use its skeleton to repair the hunter's ship and fight the wizard.
    -   In another episode, Aladdin actually _becomes_ a shark via a Forced Transformation spell from a Clingy Jealous Girl mermaid and is forced to attack Genie, Iago, and Abu.
-   Subverted in an episode of _American Dragon: Jake Long_ where Jake is tasked with guarding a shark-woman who holds in possession (in her stomach) Poseidon's trident.

The only evil shark-men Jake fights are a group of escaped delinquents who want to flood the world with Poseidon's trident.

-   _Bob's Burgers_: In "The Deepening", Mr. Fishchoder buys a mechanical shark used in a movie filmed in the town to attract tourists. The Belcher kids accidentally tip it over, causing it to crawl down the street and break everything in its path.
-   _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_: "The Predator" lampshades and plays with the trope. The episode begins with Ma-Ti freaking out when he sees a huge shark (which Gi later identifies as a basking shark) following him while he swims. The townspeople hear the discussion and panic as well, which leads them to bring in Bleak. When Gaia gives them the standard pre-mission breakdown, Wheeler comments that he feels pretty weird trying to save sharks, and Gaia explains that only some sharks are potential man-eaters and all of them are important to the ecosystem.
-   11 years before the first _Austin Powers_ movie, _Centurions_ actually had sharks with Frickin' Laser Beams. In the episode "Man or Machine", Max Ray is menaced by a "Cybervore," a shark that Cyborg Mad Scientist Doc Terror has outfitted with high tech weaponry.

-   _DuckTales (1987)_:
    -   A shark can be seen chasing Scrooge McDuck's submarine in the opening theme.

-   _Eek! The Cat_
    -   The show has that gag about a shark that can chase you on land on its "The Thunder Lizards" segment.
        
        "Darn this evolution thing!"
        
    -   Cross the shark with the Angry Guard Dog and you get Sharky the sharkdog.
-   Timmy on _The Fairly OddParents!_ has to dive into shark-infested waters. Good thing he is missing his emotions at the time.
    
    **Shark 1:** He's not scared!  
    **Shark 2:** He's weird, he's weird! (_sharks run off_)
    
-   In _Family Guy_ Joe gets a past life reading and finds out he was once an octopus. He thinks this is great until a shark swims past and bites off all his tentacles.
-   The _Fangface_ episode "A Toothy Shark Is No Lark" has a cruise ship threatened by a gigantic shark, under the command of an evil fish man. There's a lot of shenanigans with Fangface trying to hold the shark's mouth open with a car-jack so it won't bite him. Eventually the fish man is arrested and the shark, thoroughly confused by the experience, returns to the sea.
    -   Also invoked in the earlier episode "A Creep From The Deep", when Fangface attempts to eat Puggsy while scuba diving, prompting Puggsy to cry "Help! _Jaws_ has caught me in his jaws!"
-   Aside from the page quote given above, _Futurama_ has a couple other examples.
    -   The Carcarons of "Zapp Dingbat" are a race of shark-like aliens that Zapp Brannigan is working on negotiations with. Given that this is Zapp we are talking about talking to a race of Shark Men with little tolerance for any slights towards them, things go about as well as you'd expect.
    -   In the episode "A Taste of Freedom", one display at the Museum of Ancient Weapons is of a "Sharkapult", which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   In the _Goof Troop_ episode "Cabana Fever", this is played for sadistic laughs when a shark is _really_ determined to eat Pete. Specifically. Enough to burrow underground into an active volcano to chase after him.
-   The _House of Mouse_ short "Goofy's Extreme Sports: Shark Feeding."
-   Who could forget the marvelous subversion in _Jabberjaw!!_
-   _Kenny the Shark_, where the eponymous shark is a household pet, subverts this trope and somewhat plays it straight. While Kenny does cause a bit of trouble, he usually has good intentions when causing it.
-   _Littlest Pet Shop (2012)_: The Biskit twins' mansion has a fountain with a tiny shark in it. In "What's In The Batter", their security guard gets knocked in, and the shark clamps on his head, making him run around screaming.
-   A few _Looney Tunes_ cartoons:
    
    -   The Bugs Bunny cartoon _Rabbitson Crusoe,_ which features Yosemite Sam, a pair of desert islands (1 Castaway, 1 Palm Tree), and the shark Dopey Dick, all in addition to Bugs.
    -   The latter-day Sylvester and Tweety cartoon _Hawaiian Aye Aye_, which features a shark as a dog\-type pet of Granny's, who does everything he can to protect Tweety from Sylvester. Even at the end, as Granny and Tweety leave on a cruise ship, that bad ol' putty tat still tries to go after the little yellow bird, while the shark still goes after Sylvester.
    
    **Tweety:** That bad ol' putty tat sure don't give up easy.  
    **Shark:** Yes, and I don't give up easy either.
    
-   In _The Mask_, when ineffectual villain Fish Guy (who is half-fish, half-really dumb adolescent) puts on the Mask, he becomes "Shark Dude".
-   And back in 1976, DePatie-Freleng has _Mister Jaw_, a top-hatted, German-accented Great White, no less.
-   Bull Sharkowski from _My Gym Partner's a Monkey_ is the school bully at Charles Darwin Middle School, though he lives in fear of his older sister Euripides, who is actually smaller than him but has museum-worthy baby teeth.
-   Turns up as Nightmare Fuel in _My Little Pony Tales_ of all places. Schoolgirls Patch and Bon-Bon, through a major lapse in judgment by the former, find themselves floating over the ocean in a hot-air balloon, which is then damaged by birds. Just when they think they've hit their bleakest moment (and this isn't even the first time Bon-Bon's been in a life-threatening situation), they look down and see shark fins in the water.
-   _The Octonauts_ averts this besides being a kids' show with Lemmy the Lemon Shark, who after being helped by Peso _twice,_ rescues the cute little penguin (and the cuter littler starfish said penguin came to rescue) from a volcanic sea vent.) After it's over and Lemmy is finally reunited with his fellow lemon shark "dudes," he's given a sticker on his nose by Peso.
-   Chomper the shark from _Rainbow Fish_ is a local bully along with his buddy Stingo the stingray.
-   On _The Real Ghostbusters_, the Ghostbusters encounter a Megalodon while time-skipping and landing in a prehistoric ocean. Though, whilst citing the time period as being the Cenozoic Era is accurate enough, and the creature being introduced with a giant fin cutting through the water, when the Megalodon is actually seen under the water, it looks less like a giant shark, and is closer to looking like a Mosasaur, a group of sea-lizards that went extinct about the same time as the dinosaurs.
    
    **Peter:** What does a Megalodon _eat_?  
    **Egon:** Anything smaller than itself.  
    (_cue frantic swimming away_)
    
-   _ReBoot_
    -   A season 2 episode features a game set underwater. The User's submarine is very shark-like. Not to mention a scene where mer-Bob and mer-Dot are surrounded by a school of sharks until Bob cuts one in half and scares the rest off.
    -   One of those sharks reappears in "System Crash", only it's completely helpless with no water to swim in.
-   The Witch Hedwig the Big Bad of _Saban's Adventures of the Little Mermaid_ has an army of sharks as her henchmen.
-   _Scooby-Doo_ once got involved with a prehistoric shark (or so it seemed).
-   _Sealab 2021_
    
    -   In the episode "Tinfins", Dr. Quinn placed a shark's brain into a robot shark's body.
    
    **Quinn:** What I did was I took nature's most perfect killing machine, and needlessly turned it into a robot.
    
    -   And then there's the episode where they are trapped in an underwater cave with their oxygen supply running out, with a very persistent Great White waiting for them at the only way out. They end up dying at the end of the episode when they run out of air.
    -   Subverted with the shark that (allegedly) killed Marco: Marco _was_ sleeping with his wife, so it's hard to blame him. The half-human, half-shark Sharko that resulted however, is the Butt-Monkey and Cousin Oliver of Sealab.
-   _Space Ghost_ episode "Revenge of the Spider Woman''. One of the title villain's monsters is a three-headed Hydro Shark that tries to eat Space Ghost. Unfortunately, Space Ghost's Hammer Ray fails to stop it.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    
    -   Played with in one episode where SpongeBob accidentally becomes the new lifeguard.
    
    **SpongeBob:** _Emergency! Everybody out of the water!_  
    **Bather:** What's the problem?  
    **SpongeBob:** Um... _there are sharks in there!_  
    (_cut to a nerdy-looking shark and his family_)  
    **Shark:** Hey, that's my family you're talking about.
    
    -   Another episode has SpongeBob joining a gang of sharks and worrying they could be thugs. Subverted in that the sharks turned out be decent guys, and their gang is actually a dancing troop.
    -   Played straight when Mrs. Puff gets fired and replaced with a Drill Sergeant Nasty shark instead. However, even _he_ is unable to teach Spongebob how to successfully drive, so Mrs. Puff is hired again.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: Riff Tamson is an anthropomorphic shark man and a sadistic, ferocious Separatist commander who actually bites his enemies to death on top of that.
-   _Street Sharks_ was essentially the unholy bastard child of this trope and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. No, really.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_ has Armaggon, who was also in some of the comics and the SNES _Tournament Fighters_, in the fourth season. This version of the character is an alien Shark Man who is a bounty hunter and wears bulky power armor that also doubles as his spaceship. It features twin laser Gatling guns, missile launchers, and a very powerful mouth hatch with metal-shredding teeth, in addition to his own razor-lined mouth inside. He's hired to hunt down the Turtles and bring them to Dregg, the main villain of season 4, and the Turtles later succeed in making the hunt personal for Armaggon, creating a secondary recurring villain.
-   _Total Drama Island_ features freshwater sharks. _Revenge of the Island_ has them return. One shark in particular, due to exposure of toxic waste, was mutated so that it can breathe air as well as water, and can walk on land.
    
    -   In _All-Stars_, Scott reveals that sharks are his greatest fear due to said land-shark brutally attacking him last season, forcing him into a trauma chair after his elimination. Don't worry, he got better.
    
    "Okay, maybe I have a phobia of sh-sh-sharks... Can you blame me?"
    
-   Much like _Transformers: Robots in Disguise_, _Beast Wars_ provides an aversion with Cybershark. A Maximal, his bio describes him as a swashbuckling hero who chases after space pirates. He never appeared in the series, however, and only appears in the IDW comics. Played straight elsewhere, however, particularly with the Seacon Overbite. He did appear, in a fashion, as the Predacon Sky-byte in _Transformers: Robots in Disguise_.
-   _The Venture Bros._:
    -   In the episode "The Family That Slays Together, Stays Together (Part 1)", the maritime-themed villain Go-Fish tries to kill Brock Samson by chumming the water to attract sharks.
    -   The Monarch teaches a lesson to a treacherous minion by putting him into a shark tank. However, since he'd previously replaced the guy's blood with acid, the sharks won't touch him. So... "Lower the giant HAIR DRYER!!!"
-   _Wander over Yonder_: Emperor Awesome, who is a Shark Man and one of the most recurring villains. He destroys planets by _partying_!
-   _What A Cartoon! Show_ has subversion. Pfish is a shark who is partnered with Chip, a dyspeptic bobcat. Together they are officers in the bomb squad of a police precinct.
-   Averted with Shark from _WordWorld_.
-   Averted with Sharko from _Zig & Sharko_, who protects Marina from Zig who always tries to eat her.

    Other 

-   If you thought the Tu-95 "Bear" nuclear bomber was bad news, there's the Project 941 "Akula"(shark) ballistic missile submarine (known in the west as the "Typhoon" class), the largest in the world. Threatening? _You bet_.
    -   The most modern Russian attack submarine, the Project 671B Schuka-B goes by the NATO reporting name "Akula". Although it is not as terrifying as the Russian Akula(the Typhoon), it is a definite threat for Western submarines.
    -   Also, the Russians have the Kamov Ka-50 attack helicopter, known as the "Chornaya Akula" (Black Shark).

    Real Life 

-   When the USS _Indianapolis_ sank, an unknown number of crewmembers were killed and eaten by Oceanic whitetip sharks, who are notorious for being unstoppable (people tried explosives, they failed to do anything) when it comes to hunting, as their open-sea habitat is basically a watery desert in terms of resources, so large predators like them have to be willing to take advantage of any food source they can. They're possibly responsible for the most human deaths of _any_ species of shark (in fact, they possibly have a higher death toll than all other sharks _combined_), namely because they would be the only ones to swarm shipwreck survivors, and they get away with it as the carnage happens out of sight, to people that don't care what shark it is. It was even they that mariners nicknamed "Sea dogs" because of their slow and cautious but curious pace when investigating something new. It is admittedly impossible to truly say how willing they are to kill humans though as outside of shipwreck situations (where the chaos of the many bodies and blood in the water may change their behavior) they are often not aggressive, merely curious, and even with shipwrecks it is impossible to say how many people they actually killed as opposed to simply disposed of after the person died from injuries or exposure.
-   Because Australia wasn't dangerous enough yet, the 2010-2011 Queensland flooding disaster has allowed aggressive bull sharks to roam the streets of Brisbane. They also have the only known golf course water hazard that includes sharks.
-   Brook Watson, the British merchant and trader from the 17th century, and later Lord Mayor of London, was attacked by an unidentified shark at the harbor in Havana at age 14. It ate his right leg before he was saved by his fellow crewmen. He lived on to his remarkable career despite his handicap, although his political enemies poked fun at his predicament. Eventually, he was immortalized in the painting Watson and the Shark by John Copley (who had clearly never seen a shark), meant to encourage other orphans to seek out a long a good life no matter their situation.
