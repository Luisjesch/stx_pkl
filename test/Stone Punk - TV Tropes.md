_"Realize I’m living in the Stone Age  
No fax, no cellular phone age  
Pick my teeth with a dinosaur bone age  
Liftin’ heavy boulders every day for my wage"_

Stonepunk is a sub-genre of the Punk Punk science fiction genre. Stonepunk focuses on pre-technological developments in prehistoric times, its juxtapositions of the modern world with the primitive, and the effects of an early form of "advanced" technology on society, like _The Flintstones_, based on primitive materials such as rock, fire, clay, rope, wood and water. Unlike most classic Cyberpunk or Steampunk influenced fiction like Clock Punk, the Stone Age supplies the inspiration behind a modified form of technology based on the materials provided by the natural elements and surrounding environment. Bamboo Technology is common. Depending on the setting, there may be Sufficiently Advanced Bamboo Technology as well. This is the most likely Punk Punk to be Played for Laughs, given its most famous examples.

The defining feature of Stone Punk is the representation of modern inventions and technology but made with primitive materials, making the prehistoric setting a Purely Aesthetic Era. The idea here is that (for instance) road signs and furnishings would not have existed, but as a Rule of Funny and in order to further highlight the primary societal differences they have been included. Having the familiar aspects can make the foreign aspects seem even more foreign to the audience, which is used as a method of storytelling as a sort of constant reminder that "this work is set in a completely different world".

    Anime And Manga 

-   _Dr. STONE_ falls into this setting due to its premise of Omnidisciplinary Scientist Senku waking up in a world with Stone Age technology. The existing society already has the Stone; Senku creates the Punk by helping to raise their living standards, bit by bit, until it's reached the 21st century life he's used to. These Stone Age people still wear loincloths, live in straw and wooden huts, and think Senku's achievements are magic, but through his efforts, they now have access to eyeglasses, firearms, chemical weapons, electrical lighting, audio playback technology, indoor climate control, telecommunications, motorized transport, and cola, all of them made from scratch with materials available in the area. That being said, this civilization was already on the verge of becoming this trope when Senku arrived, as one of the villagers, Chrome, thinks like a scientist, was close to some breakthroughs all on his own (such as electricity and pharmaceuticals), and is the only villager who can consistently keep up with Senku's explanations.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Flintstones_ takes the setting of the animated series and uses it to satirize modern society. Many technologies are animal-based, like a small elephant serving as a vacuum cleaner.
-   Played with in _The Goddamned_. The story is set 16 centuries after Adam and Eve's exile from Eden and before The Great Flood, and the most advanced tech we ever see are iron weapons and wheeled caravans, though Cain's recognition of these advancements imply that they are rediscovered and reinvented as civilizations rise and fall.
-   _Rahan_ The main character invents various technologies when needed.

    Films — Animated

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Flintstones_ and _The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas_ are set in the same modern-day version of the Stone Age as the cartoon.
-   _Noah_ may be the first example of "Bible punk". In contrast to the agrarian Noah, the descendants of Cain form a pseudo-industrial society that ravages the Earth, all before the invention of writing.

    Literature

-   _Gilligan's Island_: While set in contemporary time, the available materials to the castaways was bamboo and coconuts, leaving them with this level of technology.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _GURPS_ online magazine _Pyramid_ vol 2 had an article called "Stonepunk", set in a society with TL 0+8 technology, although cutting edge "nantotech" (having items disassembled and reassembled by trained ants) is early TL 0+9.

    Toys 

-   The Imaginext franchise from _Fisher-Price_ had several prehistoric-themed sets complete with Bamboo Technology, bone architecture, battle-ready cavemen, and various dinosaurs and ice-age mammals that were often mounted as cavalry by said cavemen.

    Video Games 

-   _Chrono Trigger_'s prehistoric world has humans and sapient dinosaurs coexisting (not at all peacefully), with the humans somehow contriving to have gear that's more advanced than the stuff from the far-off future (including robot parts and _guns_) while the dinosaurs have a medieval-ish castle with remote-opened doors.
-   _Far Cry Primal_ has two enemy tribes of the Wenja, the brutish Cannibal Tribe known as the Udam and the Human Sacrifice\-practicing Izila. The Udam can manufacture hallucinogenic poison bombs, and the Izila have fire bombs, fortresses, and a farming system. Player Character Takkar captures one Udam and one Izila to learn how to make their weapons and arm his tribe.

-   _Monster Hunter_ plays with this a bit. The actual level of technology is somewhere between Sandal Punk and Steampunk, but a large portion of it is made of wood and the parts of the Monsters you hunt throughout the games.
-   _Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time_ has the third episode, "Clan of the Cave Raccoon". Sly and the gang travel to the Stone Age after crashing the van along with the time machine. They then meet Sly's prehistoric ancestor, the first known Cooper in history and the greatest thief of the Ice Age.
-   The Land of the Cragnons in _Super Paper Mario_ is firmly in this trope, in which the Cragnons live in stone dwellings, dress in loincloths, and fight wooly mammoths with clubs, while their technology is at least advanced enough to have Reality Television.
-   _War Party_ has a trio of stone age tribes using tech influenced by a long lost ancient civilization. One tribe even makes use of mechanical arms and golems.
-   _Zeno Clash_ and it's sequel are set in a prehistoric actually post-apocalyptic society where weapons and houses are made out of bone and stone, the only culture is built around Might Makes Right, no written language exists, and any attempts to establish laws and civilization are met with hostile resistance. _Clash: Artifacts of Chaos_, set in the same universe, is an even _more_ primitive take on the setting.
