This is when a character leaves/abandons someone that they were close to, maybe out of an obligation, personal reasons, or not by their own choice.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Maybe a character is a Living Emotional Crutch or a Morality Chain to them. Maybe they have implied romantic feelings for them. Maybe they were a pair of True Companions, or family. In some cases, the person left behind may not even have realized their feelings until the other left.

In any case, the character who is abandoned for whatever reason goes crazy after the other leaves them, so this is more like the end result of a character's Living Emotional Crutch leaving them.

Sometimes, if the abandoned character eventually learns the "gone" character came back or did not actually die, they may regain some of their sense of stability, or not if they are too far gone or resentful from the character's disappearance.

Related to Love Makes You Crazy. The "gone" guy/girl could be a Cynicism Catalyst.

If the "gone" character is still alive, the "crazy" character may decide that I Will Find You, which may lead to Roaring Rampage of Rescue... but if the "gone" character is well and truly dead, the "crazy" character might actually go the other route.

Supertrope to Psycho Ex-Girlfriend and Angsty Surviving Twin. Compare Go Mad from the Isolation and Loners Are Freaks, where somebody goes crazy because _everybody's_ gone (or if someone's especially lonely, this might actually end up being the result anyways).

-   _Berserk_: Griffith gradually becomes obsessed with his best warrior Guts, such that when Guts decides to leave the Hawks after deciding that he's not going to be a part of Griffith's dream, Griffith's thoughts during the resultant duel, about how he would not let him go, are very unhinged; when Guts beats him in the duel and wins his freedom, Griffith cannot take it and immediately goes to sleep with Princess Charlotte while thinking about Guts and his leaving the whole time. In fact, the events that set into place his downfall and lead up to the horror that is the Eclipse is caused partly by Guts leaving.
-   _Hellsing_: Zorin makes a point to kill Pip after maiming Seras. The two share a Last Kiss and at his (Pip) request Seras drinks his blood in order to become a true vampire. This, coupled with Seras' anger at losing Pip, allows her to utterly massacre Zorin and her forces.

And when later it is Rei's turn to be absorbed for an Angel, he activates his robot's full power, even though Ritsuko warned him that it would set off the Third Impact. Basically, Asuka and Rei are two of the few people Shinji cares about. Hurt them and expect pain.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_: _Batman: The Dark Knight Returns_ has a very creepy example. The Joker was crazy to begin with but when he contemplates a world without his nemesis and obsession Batman he falls into a catatonic shock and only hearing about Batman's activities in the news is enough to revive him.
-   _The Sandman (1989)_: A schism grew between the younger and older members of the Endless after their "prodigal sibling", Destruction, abandoned his post for good.

Even after being reverted to her old self, the very idea of someone leaving her — even if it's only for a few minutes — is so terrifying to Spinel that she lets out a Big "NO!" at the mere suggestion.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_: Emma Russell. Grief over her son's death gradually drove her to a sanity slippage, deciding that the best way to "honor" his memory is to forcibly save the world whilst creating a million repeats of the incident that killed him. It's also implied, particularly in a deleted scene and the novelization, that Mark's abandonment of Emma and Madison amid their Grief-Induced Split was a contributing factor in Emma's fall from grace, because he proved in Emma's eyes that he couldn't be relied on when Emma and Madison needed him most of all.
-   In _A Mighty Wind_, the reunion concert includes Mitch & Mickey, a former couple that released seven albums until their dramatic break-up years before the setting of the film.

    Live-Action TV 

-   An interesting case occurs with the Doctor in _Doctor Who_; only on three occasions has he been shown without a companion or a companion surrogate for an extended period of time, and in each case, it resulted in a more unhinged and dangerous Doctor.
    -   The first instance was with "The Deadly Assassin", in which the departure of Sarah Jane, the heated political turmoil on Gallifrey, and the Doctor's discontent at his home society result in a moodier, brooding, and more aggressive Doctor whose portrayal emphasizes the darker aspects of his madness, making it clear that the lack of a Morality Pet has left him noticeably unhinged.
    -   The second and more noticeable instance was with "The Waters of Mars". Again, the Doctor is without an acquaintance to keep him in check, his most recent regular companion being forced to leave him for her own protection, and his last three companion surrogates refusing to continue traveling with him. However, being riddled with trauma from fighting a violent war and seeing his ideals and purpose challenged time and time again over the centuries has torn at his ability to keep _himself_ in check. As circumstances seem more and more futile, he grows increasingly aggressive and unhinged, eventually deeming himself the "Time Lord Victorious" and the master of the laws of time. Only after he attempts to break said laws and sees them sharply set back on track does he realize that he's gone too far.
    -   A third time in "Heaven Sent"/"Hell Bent" when his companion Clara dies. She lampshades it, telling him, "You're going to be alone now, and you're very bad at that." The Doctor is sent into a mechanical castle where he is left alone with his grief for four and a half _billion_ years. By the time he finally escapes, he is completely off the rails and ready to face down everything from a gunship to the Lord President of Gallifrey, kill a fellow Time Lord, and endanger the very existence of all of space and time in order to get Clara back.
-   _Forever_: Seen in the flashback of "Punk Is Dead." When Abigail left Henry, saying she needed a little time to think, Henry became convinced something had happened to her when three months went by with no word. By the time Abe visited him several months after that, Henry had fallen apart completely, his apartment a Mess of Woe housing a String Theory Stalker Shrine trying to track her down. It's also implied Henry has been drowning his sorrows, both by Abe having to pull him off the floor and put him to bed, and by Abe commenting in the pilot that Henry quit drinking 28 years before.
-   _The Haunting of Bly Manor_: Viola was already struggling with being left alone in the trunk, but she at least had some hope that her husband and daughter would be reunited with her when her daughter reopened the trunk. But they threw the trunk in the lake when they left Bly, and Viola totally left what sanity she had left.
-   _Rectify:_ It's revealed that ever since Hannah died in a horrific way, her mother has been unable to get over it, and spends her days religiously walking around and moving things in her daughter's room obsessively with her son watching on, very concerned for her.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   This is what happened to the rest of the The Shield after Dean Ambrose left WWE. Both Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns drifted apart and went under severe Sanity Slippage that saw them both make Face-Heel Turns that saw them become the two most despised men on the main roster. When they had a brief mini-feud in January 2022, both of them flat-out admitted Ambrose leaving ruined them, with Reigns even admitting he never really forgave Rollins for destroying the Shield all those years ago, suggesting that Ambrose was the only reason he was able to put up with Rollins for all those Shield reunions.
-   A tragic Real Life\-example is the death of Eddie Guerrero, which is cited as one of the main contributing factors in his best friend Chris Benoit's double murder-suicide two years later.

An alternate song, "I'm Glad That They Took You Away", takes place from the perspective of his girlfriend, who sent the "nice young men in the clean white coats" to him in the first place.
-   Alan Jackson has a mild example of this in "Gone Crazy" ("_Ever since you left, I've been gone / Gone crazy, gone out of my mind..._")
-   In Garth Brooks' "The Beaches of Cheyenne", the woman in the song becomes so wrought with emotions that she ends up committing Suicide by Sea.
-   Subverted in George Strait's "She Let Herself Go". The woman's lover has left her life, so instead of _going_ crazy, she's now _going_ to places that he wouldn't let her (such as a singles cruise, a spa, and Hawaii).
-   The Statler Brothers "Flowers on the Wall," a Sanity Slippage Song about a break-up that has the singer assuring his ex he's doing fine, even if he hardly leaves his room, spending his time counting the flowers on the wallpaper, playing solitaire all night instead of sleeping, and watching inane television.

-   Played with regarding the Skull Kid in _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_. A big part of his character is his friendship with the four guardian giants of Termina; he became friends with them, but they had to leave to fulfill their duties, which the juvenile Skull Kid misunderstood as abandoning him and developed a complex over. This resentment festered until he picked up the titular Majora's Mask, which took his worst desires and behaviours and amplified them to apocalyptic levels. One of the things he did was to seal away the spirits of the four giants; this was done partially to prevent them from stopping Skull Kid's planned moon drop, but it was heavily driven by his resentment towards their perceived abandonment.
-   _Quantum Protocol_: When Kaia fixes Omega's brain computer, she encounters a wave full of cards named Queen, showing that he's obsessed with Queen.

His situation was made no better by becoming boss of his own family, the disrespect from both his underlings and superiors causing him to nurse incredible resentment towards Kazama and especially Kiryu. By the time Kiryu is out of prison, Nishiki has long since snapped and become a cold, ruthlessly effective mob boss, near-totally hostile towards his former friends.
