Don't worry, he's not here to hog her spotlight.

_"I'm sorry, the position of annoying talking animal has already been taken!"_

Odder than even an Odd Couple, one of these guys isn't human! They might be an ordinary animal who's just a bit smarter than average, some form of Talking Animal, a Robot Buddy, a space alien, or even stranger, a normally inanimate object gifted with sentience or even locomotion (and sometimes not even that). Particularly useful when it comes to going for help, stealing keys when the villain has you locked up, or throwing the OFF switch on the Conveyor Belt o' Doom once they leaves the room.

In webcomics it often takes the form of the Snarky Non-Human Sidekick. May be a Bond Creature. They often share A Boy and His X dynamic.

In a Mons Series, this takes the form of a Signature Mon.

This primarily applies if the sidekick is distinctly different from its buddy. Pinky from _Pinky and the Brain_ is decidedly nonhuman, and the Brain's sidekick, but since the Brain is a mouse himself there's no real difference.

Compare and contrast with Amusing Alien and Token Non-Human.

## Examples:

    Advertising 

-   Many years ago, Dr. Pepper did a series of commercials set "after the Cola Wars", with a human hero and his diminutive alien sidekick. In one of them, the duo walk into a bar, and the female bartender greats them with "Well, hello stranger.. and stranger yet!"

    Anime & Manga 

-   Most, if not all Mons shows can be seen as an inversion of this, because, let's face it, it's the _mons_ who do the dirty work and get the stuffing beaten out of them when things get hairy, leaving The Kid with the Remote Control as the sidekick.
    -   _Digimon_, in particular, inverts the conventions of this trope, where the Mons are The Chosen Ones and the kids are actually less crucial to the in-universe situation.
        -   Bokomon and Neemon from _Digimon Frontier_ really carry this vibe, being unable to transform or fight while the kids themselves transform into Digimon. (Not only were they never shown to fight in the series, the card game, which is the source of attack names for many a character who didn't do any fighting in the shows, gives their attacks as "Book of Knowledge" and "Pretend Sleep," respectively. They also share "Escape Dash." Being good strictly for comic relief and occasional exposition is _in their programming._
-   Most Magical Girls have one or more of these, who often overlap with Weasel Mascot, Mentor Mascot, and/or Ridiculously Cute Critter:
    -   Mepple and Mipple from _Futari wa Pretty Cure_, and for that matter, _all_ the non-human characters in _Pretty Cure_. Cute floating critters who transform into the Transformation Trinket are a mainstay of the franchise.
    -   The talking cats Luna and Artemis from _Sailor Moon_.
    -   Keroberos (Kero-chan) and Yue in _Cardcaptor Sakura_. The Clow Cards themselves could also qualify, as each card is shown to be a sentient, living thing. Also, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon.
    -   Access Time and Finn Fish in _Phantom Thief Jeanne_. Later subverted with Finn's Face–Heel Turn.
    -   The titular beings in _Shugo Chara!_.
    -   Go, the robot-dog in _Miracle Shojo Limit-chan_.
    -   Nubo and Cato in _Hana no Ko Lunlun_.
    -   The trio of kappa in _Persia, the Magic Fairy_.
    -   Mogu and Pigu, the stuffed dinosaurs in _Fancy Lala_.
    -   Posi and Nega, the alien cats in _Creamy Mami, the Magic Angel_.
    -   Topo, the fairy spirit/purple stuffed flying squirrel in _Magical Emi, the Magic Star_.
    -   Stonston the pig and Araessa the chicken in _Yume no Crayon Oukoku_.
    -   Konpoco, the raccoon-looking dog in _Esper Mami_.
    -   Shiina from _Vampire Princess Miyu_. He's also a Ridiculously Cute Critter resembling a small pink rabbit... except when he shows the hideous, swollen eye he normally kept hidden behind one of his ears. Yeah, it's that kind of show.
    -   Pokota, a stuffed lion brought to life, is Himeko's in _Hime-chan's Ribbon_ and Erica has her sentient broomstick, Chappy.
-   Almost every character in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ has one, with cats, dogs, fish, birds, whales, aliens, fairies and such.
-   _The Cat Returns_: Muta and Baron. However later in the film, this trope gets subverted when Haru herself starts to turn into a cat.
-   Patch (a dog), Bingo and Chuchu (mice), and Papy (a bird) in _The Story of Cinderella_. Misha the cat starts out as one for Cinderella's stepmother, though (in contrast to Lucifer in the Disney version) she eventually crosses over to Cinderella's side.
    -   An earlier anime adaptation of Cinderella, the version in _Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics_, gives Cinderella two pigeons named Algernon and Gwendolyn.
-   CLAMP: Rabbit-like creature Mokona in several works, most notably _Magic Knight Rayearth_, _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_, and _×××HOLiC_.
    -   Mokona is Mokona! Mokona (the original one from MKR, anyway), is also apparently God.
-   Lili the Fata (music fairy) in _La Corda d'Oro_.
-   Ein from _Cowboy Bebop_. Different in that Ein is as intelligent as any normal human, yet otherwise a normal dog, and thus, he can't speak.
-   _Doraemon_ features Doraemon, a robot cat from the future, who often acts as a sidekick to the human Nobita.
-   _Fairy Tail_: Happy, cat Charle, and Pantherlily are the sidekicks to Natsu, Wendy, and Gajeel respectively.
-   _Galaxy Fraulein Yuna_: Elner. Debatably, also Yuna's three android doubles (who eventually can appear human).
-   _Inuyasha_: To some degree, Shippo.

-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_ has among the protagonists Iggy, a Boston Terrier who commands the sand-based Stand The Fool. The opposition has Pet Shop, a hawk who commands the ice-based Horus. The two even duke it out one on one eventually. The fourth storyline (_Diamond Is Unbreakable_) has Stray Cat, a sentient cat-turned-flower with the power to launch bubbles, and the sixth (_Stone Ocean_) has Foo Fighters, _a mass of plankton_ inhabiting dead ex-criminal Etro's body.
-   Jonathan the baby seal from _Kaleido Star_.
-   Kir from _King of Bandit Jing_ is a talking crow who also serve as Jing's Equippable Ally when needed.
-   Hermes the talking motorcycle in _Kino's Journey_.
-   Mylene's highly-emotive furball Guvava in _Macross 7_.
-   All of the various devices and familiars in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_. In particular:
    -   Arf is a wolf-dog that supports Fate.
    -   Everyone _thinks_ Yuuno is one of these for Nanoha because they first met when he was in ferret form.
    -   Friedrich, Caro's baby silver dragon.
-   Chachamaru (a magic-powered gynoid) in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_.
    -   Also Chamo. And Chachamaru's "sister" Chachazero.
-   Princess Nausicaa's "fox squirrel" Teto in _Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Most of Monkey D. Luffy's crew members are humans like him (or at least partially human, as in the case of the cyborg and the skeleton) but he does have two non-human members: Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphic reindeer, and Jimbei, a Fishman.
    -   Trafalgar Law's navigator and probably the crew member who's the closest to him is Bepo, a polar bear Mink.
    -   Quite a few other, more minor crews are shown to have some non-human members as well, such as other Minks or Fishmen.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_: As with most Mons series, it's the non-human characters who are the real focus and are involved in the majority of the action. However, there are some who are clearly associated with a particular human or humans in a manner fitting this trope:
    -   Ash's Pikachu arguably fills the role best out of all the Pokémon characters in the show, since it has a highly developed relationship with Ash.
    -   Meowth of the Team Rocket trio (though he's an equal member of the group more than a sidekick).
    -   Others include Togepi for Misty (until it gets released later), Piplup for Dawn, Axew for Iris, and Pansage for Cilan.
-   Ruu the monkey (to Nowa), Setra the sceptre (to Menace), and Kere-tan the snake (to Echidna) in _Queen's Blade_.
-   _Shy_: Ebio, a shrimp-like creature that acts as Shy's advisor and Mission Control.
-   _Speed Racer_: Chim-Chim, Spritle's chimpanzee pal.
-   The Battle Spiders from the _Spider Riders_ anime of course.
-   Ryoko and her cat/rabbit thing Ryo-Ohki from _Tenchi Muyo!_.
-   Simon has Boota, his loyal little pig-mole, in _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_.
    -   While Lordgenome has General Guame The Immovable; who first filled almost exactly the same role and later evolved (literally) into a more direct sidekick role.
-   Lord/Lady Belbel in _There, Beyond the Beyond_ is a rabbit-like creature who accompanies the heroes in his/her capacity as a magician.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   The first case of a character having Duel Spirits as companions was Raphael during the DOMA arc of the original anime; he could see the spirits of his Guardian monsters and even spoke to them. (Whether or not they spoke back is unknown.)
    -   This became far more common in _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_. Judai has Winged Kuriboh (later joined by the Neo Spacians), Manjyome has the Ojamas (in the manga, it's Light and Darkness Dragon), and Johan has the Crystal Beasts, Ruby Carbuncle especially.
    -   While not as common in _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_, Luna/Ruka could see and talk to spirits, and had a few that could be considered sidekicks; Kuribbon was likely the most constant, with Ancient Fairy Dragon becoming a constant presence after her card was rescued from the Dark Signers.
    -   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_, Yuma has Astral, but he's far more a "partner" than a "sidekick". Kaito has his Robot Buddy Orbital 7 helping him most of the time.
    -   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS_, Yusaku has Ai, an AI based off of him. However, he's not giving that much help for Yusaku during duel and tends to panic a lot except giving him Storm Access. Flame is also this to Takeru, but he's more to Snarky Non-Human Sidekick.

    Comedy 

-   Comedian/ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and basically any of his puppet partners (IE: Walter, Peanut, Bubba J, Achmed, etc.). Made all the more hilarious in that one of the puppets, Peanut, points out several times that well-
    
    **Peanut:** You're arguing with yourself....AND LOSING!
    
    -   Jeff plays off this with Walter and Jose as well.

    Comic Books 

-   In _The Autumnlands: Tooth & Claw_ Dusty, an anthropomorphic dog, acts as an unofficial sidekick to the human hero.
-   _Birdman_: Avenger, the improbably intelligent golden eagle.
-   _Groo the Wanderer_: Groo's dog Rufferto
-   Ampersand, Yorick's Capuchin monkey in _Y: The Last Man_.
-   Redwing, partner to The Falcon.
-   The hero Squirrel Girl also has had two animal sidekicks, squirrels Monkey Joe and Tippy Toe
-   A super villain, the Red Ghost, was active alongside three superpowered apes.
-   The second Major Mapleleaf gained his powers from his sidekick, a horse named Thunder.
-   Tintin has his dog Milou/Snowy. This is usually his method of escape for almost everything.
-   _Jo, Zette and Jocko_: Jocko, who is Jo and Zette's pet chimpanzee.
-   _Spirou & Fantasio_
    -   Spirou has a pet squirrel, Spip, with exactly the same role as Tintin's Milou.
    -   And the Marsupilami in earlier books.
-   Belgian comic Jommeke has his parrot Flip, Jommeke's best friend and human sidekick has a dog named Pekkie and the occasional sidekick twins the Miekes have a chimpanzee named Choco. This leaves plenty of animal sidekicks to still get stuff done when one of them happens to get captured.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Krypto is Superman's Kryptonian pet dog.
    -   Supergirl's pets, Streaky the Super-Cat and Comet the Super-Horse who appeared in "The Super-Steed of Steel". And while later, they were joined by Beppo the Super-Monkey. Together, they formed the Legion of Super-Pets.
-   Ace, the Bat-Hound, Batman's dog pet. He wore a mask because a birthmark on his face would have given him away as Bruce Wayne's dog.
-   Streak, the Wonder Dog, Green Lantern Alan Scott's pet... who had human thoughts and eventually just about took over _Green Lantern (1941)_, right before it was cancelled.
-   _The Inhumans_: Lockjaw, a supersmart intelligent teleporting canine the size of a small car.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Lockheed, Kitty Pryde's pet miniature dragon.
    -   Maggot was accompanied by Eany and Meany, a pair of matter eating slugs...which were his _mutated intestines._
-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: Gyro Gearloose's sentient-lightbulb "Helper".
-   In _ElfQuest_ the Wolfriders have their wolves, and the Chosen Eight from the Gliders of Blue Mountain have their giant hawks. The Preservers could also be considered non-elf sidekicks, however annoying. A borderline example in recent episodes is Dart of the Wolfriders, whose wolf Kimo is actually a shapeshifting elf, and also his boyfriend.
-   Skink, Ethan's sidekick in _Scion_.
-   Giselle's pet squit in _Mystic_.
-   Carson the Muskrat from _Dork Tower_.
-   Kevin from _Sin City_ had an unnamed pet wolf.
-   Often used in the Anthology Comic The Beano most well known with the pairing of Dennis the Menace and Gnasher. But is also used with other characters such as Calamity James and his pet Alexander Lemming.
-   Chameleon Boy of the Legion of Super-Heroes had Proty (best described as a shape-shifting blob of Silly Putty).
-   Spot (the eponymous 'Monster') in _Stanley and His Monster_.
-   Old Lace, the pet deinonychus of Gertrude Yorkes of the Runaways.
-   Two examples from _Big Bang Comics_:
    -   Mr. US, the equivalent of Captain America, had a dog sidekick named Dogtag in his original incarnation. Dogtag was originally just a stray who wouldn't leave him alone — Mr. US made the name up on the spot when the dog followed him into a bad guy hideout. ("Uh, that's my sidekick... Dogtag!")
    -   In the other instance, Hummingbird, a combination of Hawkman and The Atom, had Edgar the raven. Of some note is the fact that Edgar is _larger_ than Hummingbird, who is permanently stuck at a maximum height of six inches.
-   The MAX incarnation of the Foolkiller had Jester, a large Rottweiler mix who was vicious to enemies but a Big Friendly Dog to innocents.
-   _Big Trouble in Little China_ gives us Pete, the unearthly hell-beast (former) servant of Lo Pan which swears its loyalty to Jack Burton following its previous master's demise.
-   _Robin_: Lagoon Boy introduces his new rather intelligent loyal animal companion, a giant fishlike crustacean thing with tentacles and several rows of serrated teeth. He calls him Spot.
-   Golden Age Timely Comics character the Ferret was a private eye who had a pet ferret, called Nosie, as a sort of sidekick.
-   _Justice Society of America_: Doctor Mid-Nite I, Charles McNider, was always accomanied during his heroics by his pet owl Hooty. His sucessor Dr. Mid-Nite II, Pieter Cross, also keeps a pet owl and while he generally does not have it accompany him into fights he does allow it to perch on his shoulder and flit about the lab as he's treating other superheroes. Cross's owl is named Charles, after the late Charles McNider.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: For a couple of years Steve Trevor found himself accompanied by the little pop-culture loving mechanic alien known as "Glitch".

    Eastern European Animation 

-   _Masha and the Bear_: Masha, a little human girl, and, well, the Bear.

    Fan Works 

-   Inverted in the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfiction _Silent Knight_. Spike and/or Twilight Sparkle are the heroes, and Chirp is the mute _human_ sidekick.
-   In King Explosion Murder the Shield Hero, Katsuki Bakugou’s group of sidekicks consists of Neia who is a water elf, Daven who is a cat demi-human, and Kirishima who is a dragon. Averted with Rino and Melty though, they are both normal humans with magic.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Disney Animated Canon_:
    -   Most (if not all) of the human heroes and heroines have a pantheon of these (besides a sub-array of generic Adorable Woodland Critters). The only aversion is _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_, which has no non-human sidekicks. Examples include:
        -   _Pinocchio_'s conscience Jiminy Cricket is considered by many to be not only the first Non Human Disney sidekick in a long line of many, but also the first wise cracking sidekick who used (what was at the time) modern humor and colloquialisms. To boot, he was also voiced by a radio star who many households at the time would've been able to distinguish: Cliff "Ukulele Ike" Edwards. In this movie there's also Figaro and Cleo, nonhuman sidekicks to Gepetto.
        -   _Make Mine Music_: Sasha the bird, Sonja the duck, and Ivan the cat to Peter.
        -   _The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad_: Gunpowder the horse to Ichabod Crane, and Cyril Proudbottom the horse to J. Thaddeus Toad (while Mole, Water Rat and Angus MacBadger are bipedal, clothes-wearing Funny Animals just like Toad, Cyril is a quadrupedal, naked Talking Animal).
        -   _Cinderella_: The mice, two of who perform the aforementioned key-stealing chore so well in that it's become the best-loved scene from that movie.
        -   _Alice in Wonderland_: The March Hare to the Mad Hatter.
        -   _Sleeping Beauty_: The three good fairies to Aurora. And Samson the horse to Prince Phillip.
        -   _The Sword in the Stone_: Archimedes the Owl to Merlin.
        -   _The Jungle Book (1967)_: Baloo, Bagheera, and the vultures to Mowgli.
        -   _The Rescuers_: Both Bernard and Bianca are considered sidekicks to the human children they helped in both films. Also the Albatross brothers, the Swamp folk, Evinrude the dragonfly, and Marahute the eagle.
        -   _The Black Cauldron_: Gurgi.
        -   _The Little Mermaid_: Sebastian the crab, Flounder the fish and Scuttle the seagull. Not to mention Max the dog, though he inexplicably can't speak like the aforementioned three can.
        -   _Beauty and the Beast_: The enchanted castle appliances, led by a clock, a teapot and a candelabra. Subverted at the end, as they are all reverted to humans under a magic spell.
        -   _Aladdin_: The Genie, Abu the monkey, and the Carpet to Aladdin. Iago the parrot joins them in the sequels after his Heel–Face Turn.
        -   _The Lion King (1994)_: Although there are no humans in the film, most of the cast are lions, and Timon and Pumbaa qualify as Simba's non-lion sidekicks.
        -   _Pocahontas_ has Meeko the raccoon, who has his own sidekick, a hummingbird.
        -   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_: Achilles (a horse) to Phoebus, Djali (a goat) to Esmeralda, and three gargoyles to Quasimodo.
        -   _Hercules_: Phil and Pegasus.
        -   _Mulan_: Mushu the guardian. Also, in non-speaking roles, a lucky cricket, a horse, a dog and a falcon.
        -   _The Emperor's New Groove_: Defied; Kuzco angers Bucky the squirrel, who then wakes up the local jaguar pack, and later tells Punch-Clock Villain Kronk where to find him. Also inverted with Kuzco and Pacha themselves, az Pacha is the human sidekick to the human-turned-llama protagonist Kuzco.
        -   _Treasure Planet_: Morph. Dr. Delbert Doppler and B.E.N. fit the bill as well.
        -   _Meet the Robinsons_: The singing frogs, Carl the robot, and Tiny the Tyrannosaurus rex.
        -   _The Princess and the Frog_: Louis and Ray from are sort of an odd example, considering the human protagonists are also in the form of frogs during the majority of the movie.
        -   _Tangled_: Maximus the horse and Pascal the chameleon. Maximus was originally a Basset Hound but was changed to a horse while keeping his canine traits because it was funny.
        -   _Frozen_: Olaf the talking snowman and Sven the reindeer (who is also Kristoff's adopted brother).
        -   _Big Hero 6_: Baymax is a robot, while the rest of the eponymous team consists of humans.
        -   _Moana_: HeiHei the chicken is Moana's cute (if dimwitted) animal sidekick, a point that gets lampshaded when Maui says Moana must be a princess because she has a sidekick. Moana actually seems to only tolerate him at best. Contrary to advertisements, Pua the piglet is not actually Moana's sidekick for most of the film. He stays on the island while Moana goes sailing, and thus is only present at the very start and at the very end.
    -   There's also sidekicks of the villains. Examples include:
        -   _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_: An unnamed raven to the Evil Queen.
        -   _Pinocchio_: Gideon the cat to J. Worthington "Honest John" Foulfellow the fox and the Phantom Blot-esque minions to the Coachman.
        -   _Fantasia_: Chernabog's demons.
        -   _Bambi_: The bloodhounds to Man.
        -   _The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad_: The weasels to Mr. Winkie. They reappear in _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ where they serve Judge Doom.
        -   _Cinderella_: Lucifer the cat to the evil stepmother.
        -   _Lady and the Tramp_ The Siamese cats to the film's human villain.
        -   _Sleeping Beauty_: Diablo the raven to Maleficent.
        -   _The Rescuers_: Brutus and Nero to Madame Medusa from the first film, and Joanna the goanna to Percival McLeach from the second.
        -   _The Fox and the Hound_: Chief to Amos Slade.
        -   _The Black Cauldron_: Creeper, the Gwythaints, and the Cauldron Born to the Horned King.
        -   _The Great Mouse Detective_: Fidget the bat to Professor Ratigan.
        -   _Oliver & Company_: Roscoe and Desoto the dobermans to Sykes.
        -   _The Little Mermaid_: Flotsam and Jetsam to Ursula.
        -   _Aladdin_: Iago the parrot to Jafar.
        -   _Pocahontas_: Percy the pug to Governor Ratcliffe.
        -   _Hercules_: Pain and Panic, the Fates, the Hydra, the Titans, and the Cyclops to Hades.
        -   _Mulan_: Hayabusa the falcon Shan Yu.
        -   _Lilo & Stitch_: Agent Wendy Pleakley to Dr. Jumba Jookiba, and Captain Gantu to Doctor Jacques von Hamsterviel in the series.
        -   _The Princess and the Frog_: The Friends from the Other Side to Doctor "The Shadow Man" Facilier.
        -   _Meet the Robinsons_: DOR-15 to Michael "Bowler Hat Guy" Yagoobian.
        -   _Home on the Range_: Junior the bison to Alameda Slim.
-   _Pixar_:
    -   Like Disney, Pixar heroes frequently have non-human sidekicks:
        -   _Toy Story 2_: A bit of an odd case. Technically all of the protagonists are non-human, but in the Show Within a Show "Woody's Roundup", Bullseye the horse is this to Woody. He also serves as this to the other toy characters, since he's the only one who isn't anthropomorphized.
        -   _Ratatouille_: Double subversion, in that not only is the non-human sidekick The Protagonist, but he has his own small human sidekick (or psychotic delusion - you decide). Truth be told, one might argue that Linguini is Remy's non-rodent sidekick because Remy is the brains of the pair.
        -   _Wall E_: M-O (a cleaner robot) and the cockroach to WALL•E, a trash-compacting robot.
        -   _Up_: Dug and Kevin.
        -   _Coco_: Miguel has Dante, while Imelda has Pepita.
    -   The villains have them as well, naturally:
        -   _Toy Story_: Scud the pit bull to Sid Phillips.
        -   _Up_: Charles Muntz's dogs.
-   Altivo the horse is this to the protagonists of _The Road to El Dorado_.
-   Villains get these in many films— see Rasputin's bat Bartok in _Anastasia._
-   Tom and Jerry themselves in _Tom and Jerry: The Movie_. Also, The Fat Dog on a Skateboard for the villain.
-   Perhaps the biggest abuse of this trope is the animated version of _The King and I_. _Every single major character_ has a sidekick, and they're mostly animals. The animals have little role in the plot besides comic relief.
-   _Hayao Miyazaki_:
    -   The, already quoted above, "fox squirrel" Teto in _Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_.
    -   Jiji the black cat in _Kiki's Delivery Service_.
    -   In _Spirited Away_, Yubaba the witch is served by a bunch of lesser spirits, including three body-less heads and a human-headed bird. After Yubaba's son and bird servant get transfigured int a "mouse" and "humming bird", respectively, they become Chihiro's sidekicks.
    -   Calcifer the fire spirit and Heen the dog from _Howl's Moving Castle_.
-   In _Shrek_, the titular ogre has the talking Donkey as his sidekick. In the sequels he also gets Puss-in-Boots. Lampshaded by Donkey in _Shrek 2_.
    
    **Donkey:** I’m sorry, the position of annoying talking animal has already been filled.
    
-   In _Little Angels: The Brightest Christmas_, Daniel is accompanied on his journey with his family's dog, Scout.
-   Filmation‘s adaptation of Treasure Island has Hiccup the mouse who accompanies Billy Bones, he is named as such because he is addicted to liquor and hiccups after he gets drunk, after Bones’ death he goes with Jim.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Star Wars_: Han Solo and Chewbacca. R2-D2 and C-3PO also work for the group as a whole.
-   _A Boy and His Dog_ features the titular boy and dog duo, which shares a telepathic bond.
-   _Beastmaster_. Seeing as his best friends are a tiger, a hawk, two ferrets and so forth, Non Human Sidekick sums up the entire concept of the movies and the show.

-   _Interstellar_: The robots TARS and CASE to the human crew.
-   Stanley Ipkiss's dog Milo in _The Mask_.
-   Possibly subverted in _Ladyhawke_, a story of two cursed lovers, a man who is a wolf by night and a woman who is a hawk by day.
-   Dog in _Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior_
-   The monkey in _Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome_ - does help him out in two occasions

-   Roger plays a natural sidekick to Eddie Valiant in _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_.
-   Nails the Spider in _Cool World_.
-   Hey Man in _Rock of Ages_.

    Literature 

-   Keeley from _Greystone Valley_ is a tiny dragon who can be quite handy thanks to her speed and occasional habit of sneezing fireballs.
-   Several in _The Baby-Sitters Club_, although Mary Anne's cat Tigger is probably the most frequently showcased — partly because Mary Anne, unlike the others, is an only child.
-   _Phenomena_: the main characters are elves(well Sha-ra is never specified but heavily implied to be one) and a winter bear but they all speak and act like a family. But Alk finds an ahmel and they become good friends and becomens his sidekick, and only Alk can speak to it. But sadly the ahmel is eaten alive early in the 2nd book... but they get new ones like wolves, eagles and a dragon as the story progresses.
-   A number of these occur in the Tamora Pierce _Tortall_ series.
    -   Alanna and Faithful, a black cat who is possibly a God avatar.
    -   Daine - justified in this case, as Daine is can speak to animals. Her two closest non-human partners are Cloud, her pony, and Kitten, a baby dragon. A partial list of her other companions includes the cat, badger, and platypus gods, cats, dragons, Stormwings, basilisks, a marmoset, wolves, hyenas, bats, various birds, a squirrel, a ferret, and a massive array of undead dinosaurs.
-   In _Four Seasons for Little People_, the squirrel appears in almost of the illustrations with the human children, probably serving as a visual gag.
    -   Kel makes it a point to always be kind to both animals and non-noble humans, something not always approved of in her time and has an array of animal friends unmatched by any character other than Daine; interestingly, there Kel has more recurring animal friends than _Daine_. She rescues a massive temperamental horse going for the slaughter, temporarily fosters a very hostile baby griffin at great personal risk, adopts a flock of sparrows, and has a dog who has accounted for a number of deaths in battle.
    -   Aly takes this to the next level, as she marries a crow who could turn into a man, Nawat.
    -   Bekah Cooper has a cat that is hinted to be the same cat that Alanna possesses - though Bekah lived a number of generations before Alanna.
-   Conrad had Bortan, a mutated armoured dog for a pet (not really a sidekick as he's not there till the end of the book), in _...And Call Me Conrad_
-   In Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ series, first Twoflower and then Rincewind are followed about by the trusty Luggage, one of the best animated objects _ever._
    -   Additionally, Death of the same series has the Death of Rats, a dark-robed rat skeleton that preforms the function of death for small rodents, and his horse Binky. Death technically isn't human, but he's pretty close.
    -   It may be stretching the definition, but Tiffany Aching's loyal Nac Mac Feegles may also count.
    -   Greebo in the witch novels certainly does (except when Humanity Ensues). There's also Errol the swamp dragon in _Guards! Guards!_, who briefly becomes the Watch mascot. And You, the kitten adopted by Granny Weatherwax toward the end of the series.
    -   Keith in _The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents_ has the titular Maurice (a cat) and the educated rodents. Although Maurice would insist that the "stupid-looking kid" is _his_ sidekick.
-   In Steven Brust's _Dragaera_ books, Vlad Taltos has a jhereg familiar Loiosh, who looks like a miniature wyvern and acts as a Servile Snarker.
-   _Land of Oz_:
    -   _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_: Toto, Dorothy's faithful dog, is her first traveling companion, and her most common one.
    -   The Scarecrow, as an inanimate object brought to life. Cowardly Lion is also a legit example, being a sentient feline in the original. He is later joined by the Hungry Tiger, who openly longs to 'eat fat babies', but can't because he has a conscience.
    -   The Patchwork Girl (a large stuffed doll), Jack Pumpkinhead (a mannequin), the Glass Cat and the Sawhorse, all of which become sentient via the magical — and later outlawed — Powder of Life. There's also mention of accidents with a phonograph and a bearskin rug. It seems that every mundane animal that makes the trip to Oz ends up talking, such as Billina the hen, Jim the horse, Eureka the kitten, and the Wizard's piglets.
-   Tock (a literal **watch**dog) and the Humbug (an oversized beetle) in _The Phantom Tollbooth_.
-   _The Reynard Cycle_: Prophet, Tiecelin's talking raven in _Reynard the Fox_. "Doom!"
-   The Stark kids' direwolves in _A Song of Ice and Fire_
-   Wolf, of _The Chronicles of Ancient Darkness_.
-   Grimya the telepathic mutant wolf from Louise Cooper's _Indigo_ series.
-   _The Chronicles of Prydain_: Gurgi is an ally to Taran and the remainder heroes. He is not human, but what he is exactly is never really clear.
-   _Chronicles of the Kencyrath_ is full of these. The most common Shanir trait is being bound to animals, which means they're a Non Human Sidekick.
    -   Jame is always accompanied by Jorin, an ounce (small hunting cat). Jorin, blind from birth, uses Jame's eyes to see, while Jame sometimes gets sensory impressions from Jorin's senses of smell and hearing. Jorin also warns Jame when he becomes aware of danger, though Jame sometimes ignores them to her detriment.
    -   Shade and her adder, Addy
    -   Gorbel and his silly-looking dog, Twizzle.
    -   All the Falconeers: Tarn and Torvo, and later Turvie. Mouse and Mick and Mack.
    -   Torisen and Yce, though she's... kind of human, and gets more so with age.
-   Mogget and the Disreputable Dog in Garth Nix's Old Kingdom series.
-   The _Harry Potter_ series gives the Golden Trio each a pet. Then there is Fawkes the phoenix, who is definitely is this for Dumbledore. Voldemort also has this with his snake Nagini, although material outside the main series of books indicates she used to be a human who was cursed into becoming a snake, the books never state she's anything other than an animal. It's turns out she's something of a Bond Creature when it's revealed that she's a horcrux as well.
-   The _The Inkworld Trilogy_ has two martins.
-   Jordan and Ixil from Timothy Zahn's _The Icarus Hunt_.
-   _Humanx Commonwealth:_ Pip and Flinx.
-   Greyn from _Secret Of Dragonhome_ fits this very well as a wolf. Given Melayne's power to speak to animals, he also acts as a mentor towards the end of the book.
-   Horus and Jack from Matthew Reilly's _Seven Ancient Wonders_, Horus being a Perigrine Falcon.
-   Kazairl in the _Shadowleague_ books.
-   Somewhat part of this trope, as the protagonist isn't really human, In _Tale of the Body Thief_, the vampire Lestat adopts a stray dog, not for food, keeps him as a pet.
-   In _Star Wars: The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance_, pirate Jet Nebula has a faithful droid called Clunker as companion, who can't talk (or even beep R2-style) but can use a military sign language for communication.
-   Curdle the milk carton in _Un Lun Dun_.
-   Tobias and Ax in _Animorphs_. Technically speaking, neither one of them is human but Tobias _used_ to be. He's soon stuck in Hawk form.
-   The cat Bastet in several of the early _Amelia Peabody_ novels, even though these are mysteries, not fantasies. She is amazingly, though not quite supernaturally, intelligent and loyal. When she eventually dies at an advanced age, other cats show up — sometimes her descendants, sometimes just adopted strays — to continue the tradition, though only her daughter comes close to her calibre. By the way, the stories mostly take place in Egypt and the cat Bastet is _always_ referred to as "the cat Bastet," _never_ just "Bastet," as if even the very unsuperstitious Emersons wanted to be careful that she not be mistaken for any other Bastet.
-   In the _Heralds of Valdemar_ series, the Companions (essentially avatars of the gods or souls of previous Heralds in horse form), Firecats (former Sons of the Sun reincarnated in cat form), and the Hawkbrother's bondbirds can function as sidekicks. Some Shin'a'in may consider their battlesteeds to be this.
-   In Poul Anderson's "To Build A World", Oscar.
-   Two cases pop up in _Dinotopia_. In the main books, there's Bix the _Protoceratops_, although she probably wouldn't take too kindly to being called a sidekick, and in the prequel _First Flight_, there's Fritz, a floating robot head who lost his body in a junkyard.
-   Played with in Kafka's "Cares of a Family Man", in which a nameless narrator has a little wooden thing that follows him around and talks to him; the narrator isn't exactly fond of little Odradek, and in fact thinks he's a little creepy, especially since the creature has been around as long as he can remember without ever aging.
    -   Also from Kafka, the unfinished "Blumfeld" tells the story of an elderly bank clerk that discovers that he is being stalked by a pair of magical bouncing balls of energy that he can't get rid of.
-   _Legacy of the Dragokin_: Wispy is a cat who follows Benji and (unwillingly) assists in his schemes.
-   In _Half World_, Melanie's sidekick is a talking stone rat named Jade Rat.
-   Tobimar (human) and Poplock (intelligent toad) in _The Balanced Sword_. Though Poplock will probably claim that Tobimar is _his_ sidekick.
-   From _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Harry Dresden has several. First, and most important for much of the series was Bob the Skull. At first glance, a sarcastic talking skull, but really a spirit of intellect. He sometimes provides a helping hand (so to speak), though his main purpose is to serve as a repository of information regarding aspects of magic and magical beings.
    -   Harry's next sidekick is Mister the Cat, a large but otherwise normal housecat. He doesn't do much, but Harry sometimes lets Bob possess him for a short while to act as an extra set of eyes and ears.
    -   Lastly, comes Mouse a Tibetan Mastiff and Fu dog. He's got some supernatural powers, has tremendous levels of strength and durability, is as smart as at least most people, and is capable of fully understanding human speech. Of course being a dog means he still can't speak or do things that require opposable thumbs.
-   In the _Jacob's Ladder Trilogy_, Mallory has Gavin, a talking, snarking basilisk, who is in fact the point of view character in a lot of scenes involving Mallory.
-   Stephen King's _The Dark Tower_ series features Oy the billy-bumbler in 5 of the 7 books, beginning with the 3rd one, _The Waste Lands_. A billy-bumbler looks like a blend of dog, raccoon, and muskrat, with golden-ringed eyes and a long tail that rolls up. Oy is remarkably intelligent and can speak English to a limited extent (he understands it better than he speaks it). He is fiercely loyal and brave, and counts as a full member of the _ka-tet_ band of gunslingers.
-   _Togetherly Long_: Chiisai is an unidentified magical creature looking like a man-sized newt with porcupine quills, and she's Oukii's sidekick.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Twiki from _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century_
    -   Also Dr. Theophilus, although given that he's a sentient AI charged with helping run the affairs of humanity one could argue an inversion in this case.
-   The Bear from _B.J. and the Bear_
-   _Game of Thrones_: The dragons to Daenerys.
-   KITT from _Knight Rider_
    -   Or is Michael KITT's sidekick, considering how often KITT gets Michael out of trouble?
-   Austrian series _Inspector Rex_ may be a unique example in that the dog is the main character.
-   K-9 in _Doctor Who_
    -   Also usually inverted with the Doctor and his companions: he's a nonhuman with generally human sidekicks.
    -   The TARDIS as well.
-   On _Wonderfalls_ the main character, Jaye, often receives cryptic advice from many supposedly inanimate objects, including a wax lion, a puppet chamaeleon, a wind-up penguin, and a teddy bear in a barrel.
-   Salem on _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_.
-   Fraser's deaf half-wolf Diefenbaker in _Due South_
-   Brisco's horse Comet in _The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr._
-   Spock. Possibly a Trope Codifier.
-   Muffit the robotic dog in the classic _Battlestar Galactica_.
-   _Far Scape_: John Crichton and Ka D'Argo, stepping into the shoes of Han and Chewie for this space opera. Since Crichton is both the series lead and the Token Human, technically it's also this trope any time he pairs off with somebody, but by far his biggest bromance is with D'Argo.

    Puppet Shows 

-   Chica on _The Sunny Side Up Show_.
-   Banjo on _The Lets Go Show_.
-   Snug on _Sprout House_.

    Roleplay 

-   Chompy and PBB, Frozeen's sidekicks from _Alpha Team: Mission Deep Freeze RPG_.
-   In _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_, Hyeon accidentally runs over a squirrel while on the way home from the empowering event. Out of guilt, he adopts the squirrel's child, names him Kwang, and affectionately treats him like a pet/friend.
-   Trouble, a tamed Mutant Lizard, was Rex's sidekick in the early days of _Dino Attack RPG_. Laxus the Martian could also be considered Andrew's sidekick.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ (specifically 3rd edition) gave several character classes some variety of animal companion as a built in feature. And any class might acquire one with proper feat selection. In 4th edition, only the Ranger class retained the option.
-   The Companions in _Heroine_ are not _required_ to be non-human, but most of them are, anyway, because it's just more fun. The eponymous Heroine is usually the only Token Human in the group.

    Theme Parks 

-   In the _Clyde and Seamore_ shows at SeaWorld, Seamore is Clyde's sea lion sidekick.

    Video Games 

-   _Portal 2_ has Robot Buddy Wheatley, who guides Chell through the facility and helps her stay under GLaDOS's radar. However, after Wheatley betrays you, you get GLaDOS instead (or rather, GLaDOS in a potato). She's not much of a sidekick (she can't move, can't help you with puzzles, and barely has the energy to think), but she does offer some useful insights and is a big help during the Final Boss.
-   Clank, Ratchet's Robot Buddy from the _Ratchet & Clank_ series. And also, Merc and Green in _Deadlocked_. Of course, Ratchet ain't human either.
-   The nameless dog in _Duck Hunt_, who catches the ducks you shoot, not returning it to you (it probably ate it). When you can't shoot any ducks, he'll laugh at you, as if mocking your 'stupidity'. Nevertheless, it remains one of the earliest, and still most hated video game character ever. No wonder there's versions of the game where you can shoot the dog...
-   Wang Koh-San's pelican, Heoh-Heoh from _Art of Fighting 3_.
-   Safiya's familiar the winged golem Kaji from the _Neverwinter Nights 2_ expansion _Mask of the Betrayer._
-   In _Mass Effect 2_, Tali named her combat drone. In context, this is a holographic ball of light a little bigger than a basketball that is temporarily summoned by engineers to attack enemies.
    -   It's also TWO Shout Outs to characters from BioWare's much ealier game _Baldur's Gate II_.
-   Mieu in _Tales of the Abyss_ is a cheagle (an intelligent, talking...rabbit-creature) that can do things for the party such as break stones and breathe fire.
-   Hanpan in _Wild ARMs_.
-   Dogmeat, in the _Fallout_ series.
    -   Later, ED-E and Rex. Also, (technically) Fawkes, RL-3, Lily, Raul, and Charon. And maybe Jericho, judging by his comment about "growing a fourth arm."
-   In _Age of Empires III_, European explorers can get a dog to help them fight. Like the explorer himself, this dog cannot be permanently killed.
-   _Dragon Quest VIII_ has one of these in the form of Munchie. He solves puzzles on his own and can assist you in battle with the right items. Not bad for a mouse. He's actually the hero's grandfather in disguise but then again both him and the hero are dragons that have taken human form.
-   _Samurai Shodown_ introduced Mamaha (Nakoruru's falcon) and Poppy (Galford's dog). Later games added occasional others (Paku Paku, Cham Cham's monkey, for one). And then the last one let you play AS Poppy.
-   The dog of _Fable II_. So much so it became a back of the box feature.
-   _Monster Hunter_:
    -   The Felynes, who for all intents and purposes are cats of human intelligence that can talk and stand on their hind legs. You can hire them as chefs, and from _Freedom Unite_ onwards as companions in battle. Although they're very talkative in the form of text, in-game they just sound like cats. This makes it a little jarring when your companion gets attacked by something (especially if you happen to be a fancier of cats), even though they can just burrow underground to recover from injury, while you don't get that luxury. Thankfully, Felynes bailing to heal in this manner don't count against your faint tally.
    -   Felynes are town support NPCs at best in _Monster Hunter 3 (Tri)_, unlike the other games. Your ally this time around is instead a Shakalaka, a little humanoid that is never seen without a mask. This one answers to Cha-cha. For those of you who miss your Felynes, there's a False Felyne mask you can get for Cha-cha... if you don't mind a less-than-friendly fireworks display. _3 Ultimate_ adds Kayamba, another Shakalaka.
    -   _Monster Hunter: Rise_ adds Palamutes, Canine Companions who act both as partners in battle and as mounted steeds.
-   _Final Fantasy Tactics Advance_ has Marche with Montblanc, Ritz with Shara, Mewt with Babus, and possibly, Doned with Nono and Cid with Ezel.
-   Your Creature in _Black & White_.

-   In _World of Warcraft_, your characters can gain up to 150 different Non-Combat or Companion pets, most of which are miniature animals that follow your character around - cats, snakes, frogs and the like. Some are machines, tame miniature monsters, or meta-game characters such as a mini-Diablo. There are rewards for collecting as many as you can. As a reverse of the trope, one non-combat pet awarded for participation in a tournament is called the Argent Squire/Argent Gruntling - which is a human or orc (depending on your faction) who will carry a flag for you and, with an expensive upgrade, act as a store, bank or mailbox.
    -   Also, the Hunter Class is basically built around this trope.
        -   And Warlock.
-   _Beneath a Steel Sky_: Foster and Joey, the talking, sentient robot.
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_ allows you to have a Mabari War Hound as one of your companions, whose default name is "Dog". A popular fan name is "Barkspawn", thanks to a certain webcomic.
    -   Ascended to being semi-canonical in the Darkspawn Chronicles DLC - at the very least, that's what Alistair would name him, given the chance.
-   You acquire several non-human companions in _Paper Mario_, including friendly versions of the normally hostile Goomba, Koopa, Bob-omb, Boo and Lakitu.
    -   In _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_, you get an air spirit named Madam Flurrie who helps you when you fight the Three Shadow Sirens and get her necklace back, and a Shadow Siren named Vivian who had decided to go over the Moral Event Horizon and helps Mario when his identity was stolen by Doopliss. But she didn't know it was him before. When Mario squares off with Doppliss, she runs away for three turns, then does a Heel–Face Turn to help Mario.
    -   Outside of _Paper Mario_, depending on the game one of two characters may act as a sidekick to the Bros. In the _Mario & Luigi_ games, starting with the third, it's Starlow, a Star Sprite; and in other games it's Yoshi, a... Well, Yoshi.
-   Archimedes in _Suika_ plays this role for Ojou. That is, until he moves on to Chitose and sacrifices his life so she doesn't die during surgery.
-   _Persona_:
    -   Teddie in _Persona 4_ is an interesting version. He starts off as a teddy bear thing, but gains a human body when in the real world. Though he's not a sidekick per se, he has a high regard for the protagonist, whom he calls "Sensei", and his Social Link is the only non-group one that ranks up automatically.
    -   _Persona 5_ has Morgana. Inside the Metaverse, he's a cartoony cat thing. In the real world, he takes the form of a regular cat. Unlike Teddie, Morgana is constantly at the protagonist's side, even at _school_.
-   In _Knights of the Old Republic 2_, Bao-Dur is always accompanied by a small flying orb with built-in laser. You yourself have the option of three robotic sidekicks, plus several alien ones.
-   In _La Pucelle: Tactics_, your entire party lineup aside from plot-essential humans consist of monsters you've recruited in the field.
-   In _Ghost Trick_, it could be said that Missile is Sissel's sidekick. However, it turns out that Sissel is a cat, thus meaning that all this time Sissel has been _Lynne's_ sidekick.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
    -   In the first three games and the eighth, Donald Duck and Goofy are this to Sora, as they fight alongside him right from the moment they met. And several various world-based party members are also non human, including Jack Skellington, Beast, Ariel, Simba, TRON, Woody, Buzz, Sulley, Mike, Marshmallow, and Baymax.
        -   Of course, Sora's not human in certain worlds either because of Fisher Kingdom status. This applies to Atlantica (merman), the Pride Lands (lion), Space Paranoids (computer program), Toy Box (action figure), and Monstropolis (werecat). Although in Space Paranoids and Toy Box, he does resemble a human.
    -   As of _Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories_, King Mickey can be considered one to Riku
    -   Throughout _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_, Sora and Riku can train Dream Eaters, who serve as this (particularly Meow Wow and Komory Bat, their respective starters). Both are sidekicks for Riku in _Melody of Memories_.
-   Daxter from _Jak and Daxter_, who, ironically enough, started off as a human boy before being turned into an ottsel at the beginning of the first game. At the end of the third game, Veger is also turned into an ottsel, and becomes this to Kliever by force.
-   Gloop the mimic slime from _Master of the Monster Lair_, who joins Owen early in his quest.
-   The transforming genju from _Dungeon Maker II: The Hidden War_.
-   The main character in _Escape from Thunder Island_ and its sequel, _Rita James and the Race to Shangri La_ had a hyper-competent, one-eyed monkey named Marbles as a sidekick.
-   In the later _Mystery Trackers_ games every Mystery Trackers agent has a pet of some sort, usually with special powers. The main character's own pet is a small dog they freed from being chained to a lamp post in _Mystery Trackers 3: Black Isle_.
-   Fidget from _Dust: An Elysian Tail_ counts, as she's smaller and less anthropromorphized then the main character, Dust.
-   In _Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey_, there's Jaq and Gus in Cinderella's world, and Abu in Jasmine's world, as well as the Pixie.
-   Both _Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army_ and _Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon_ give the titular hero Gouto-douji, a feline companion who happens to be extremely well acquainted with the Devil Summoner profession's every aspect. It's stated he's actually the drifting spirit of the first Raidou Kuzunoha, who commited some unspecified sin and as a result is cursed to mentor every Raidou until their ultimate death. Gouto-douji is actually the name of the curse anchoring him in the world of the living.
-   The Imp in _Witches' Legacy_ used to be Lynn's dog until Elisabeth got her hands on him. Now he sits on the hint button and helps the player with other tasks that Carrie might not otherwise be able to achieve. He even gets his own A Day in the Limelight when he has to save Carrie, Lynn and Edward in the bonus chapter of _Hunter and the Hunted_.
-   In _Holy Umbrella_, the talking bird Bonto is the first character to join you on your adventure, though he doesn't do so when you first meet.
-   When playing as Rosalina in _Mario Kart Wii_, a yellow Luma floats alongside you, and it typically giggles or gives an excited squeal whenever you do an aerial trick.
-   _Eagle Island_ features a young man (Quill) and one of his two owls (Koji) as the protagonists on a journey to save the other owl (Ichiro).
-   _The Girl and the Robot_: Obviously, the protagonists are a girl and her robot friend, which she found while trying to escape the castle. Now the two work together to escape.

    Web Animation 

-   The Cheat from _Homestar Runner_.
    -   Technically, Strong Bad is non-human but The Cheat still counts.
-   Kevin from _Gorilla Girl_.
-   Dusty from _Matt 'n' Dusty_.

-   Kumo from _Acedemy Sugoi Seiun_.
-   _DSBT InsaniT_:
    -   Evil Balloon towards Dave.
    -   Sand Snake towards Lisa.
    -   Chilly towards Autmn.
    -   Perry towards Snake.
    -   Crystal Dragon towards Cody.
    -   Several other members of the cast get one in episode 7 as carnival prizes.

    Webcomics 

-   George, the huge-eyed larval bit of monster kibble who can only emit the noise 'Meep,' is Evi's sidekick in _A Moment of Peace_. And eventually the much more bashful Hulking Shyster joins him in this role.
-   While Krosp better fits into the Snarky Non-Human Sidekick trope, the Jager trio of Dimo, Maxim, and Oggie from _Girl Genius_ fit into this trope, considering they're monstrous constructs who have an almost puppy-like devotion to Agatha to the point that they'll break into dangerous cities to aid her and/or look after anyone she considers an ally or friend.
    -   And there are the dingbots.
-   Molly the Peanut Butter Monster in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!._ Or, for that matter, her pet, Snookums the Tentacle Bunny.
-   Blackwing the raven, Vaarsuvius' familiar in _The Order of the Stick_. He only shows up, in V's own words, when Vaarsuvius acknowledges Blackwing's existence. Since V apologized for being such a terrible master and has been treating Blackwing with more respect, he could become a more straight example of this trope in the future.
-   Conrad the vampire and the unnamed zombie from _Hanna Is Not a Boy's Name_. Conrad's more whiny and the zombie's more stoic, so neither of them are really Snarky Non Human Sidekicks.
    -   Now there's also Toni the werewolf and Veser the half-selkie.
-   Bob the Crab serves as the immoral foil to both the GM's workaholic personality, and Denise who is the voice of reason in the Las Vegas Tsunami of _The Dugs_.
-   Boo and Sushi from _SPRINGIETTE_
-   Hugo the rat from _Capt'n Crazy_.
-   _Wicked Awesome Adventure_ supplies each of the playable characters with one or more live teddyanimals that function as upgradeable sidekicks.
    -   JET also carries around a real mouse.
-   While the main characters of _Goblins_ are not humans, but, well, goblins, Dies Horribly has a non-goblin sidekick: Klik. Maybe K'Seliss and Kin counts, too.
-   Mia from _Unintentionally Pretentious_ has Aibo, her robotic guide dog and guardian, making it also her Angry Guard Dog, but with a manual Berserk Button.
    -   And occasionally as a household appliance.
-   _A Beginner's Guide to the End of the Universe_ has both Snuffy the pooch and Chairman Jack the giant sparrow, which the Everyman creates or uplifts to serve as his allies. He also upgrades them to cyborgs.
-   _The Black Brick Road of O.Z._'s Straw Shawn is a living scarecrow, and he's the first person to join Dorothy's party.
-   In _Penny Blackfeather_, Princess the parrot is credited by the other characters with anything from being a pretty birdie to being the secret mastermind directing the plot. But, playing with this trope, she's actually an enchanted woman.
-   _Heroes of Thantopolis_ Xisea (a cat-spider ghost) and Trickster (an anthropomorphic bird) are Cyrus's best buds in the City of the Dead.
-   In _Yokoka's Quest_, Yfa acts as the animal sidekick to Yokoka a lot of the time, though he's fully capable of acting independently of her too.

    Web Original 

-   _How to Hero_ has an entire entry on animal sidekicks and at various points the guide recommends using magic to grant different inanimate objects sentience for convenience (such a file cabinet if you need to escape your hideout with lots of files, or a giant magnet to follow you around and deflect bullets.)

    Western Animation 

-   Bozzly from _Abby Hatcher_.
-   Appa and Momo from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_. Appa's a giant flying six-legged bison, and Momo's a flying lemur. They're animal companions with just slightly higher than normal intelligence.
    -   Naga the polar bear dog<small>◊</small> and Pabu the Fire Ferret from Sequel Series _The Legend of Korra_.
    -   In general, every Avatar has at least one animal companion, with whom they share an unbreaking bond. Aside from the aforementioned companions, Aang's predecessor as the Avatar, Roku, had a dragon named Fang.
    -   In _The Legend of Korra_, Zuko gained a non-human sidekick in his dragon Druk.
-   Snarf from _Thunder Cats_ and _Thunder Cats 2011_.
-   Plank from _Ed, Edd n Eddy_.
-   Rufus, Ron's genitalialess naked mole rat from _Kim Possible_. Funny enough, Ron seems to be supposed to be Kim's sidekick, so Rufus is technically a sidekick's sidekick.
    -   And a living Deus ex Machina to boot.
-   Slimer on _The Real Ghostbusters_.
-   _Hanna-Barbera_ _loves_ this trope. You couldn't have a Hanna Barbera cartoon at one point in time without a wacky/annoying non-human sidekick. Mr. Cool (Fonz and the Happy Days Gang), Godzooky (Godzilla animated series), Doing (Mork & Mindy cartoon), Sgt. Squealy (Laverne & Shirley in the Army), Dribbles (Harlem Globetrotters) and so on and so forth.
-   Faffy and, to a lesser extent, Twinkle the Marvel Horse in _Dave the Barbarian_.
-   Radarr, the blue-monkey creature from _Storm Hawks_, plays the role of co-pilot and constant companion to Aerrow, the leader of the heroic Storm Hawks.
-   Capt. HuggyFace in _WordGirl_.
-   Every DTV _Barbie_ movie seem to have one.
-   Fetch, Loud Kiddington's dog on _Histeria!!_
-   _Jonny Quest_. Bandit is the Quests' Team Pet dog. He gets Jonny into trouble as often as he gets him out of trouble.
-   Custard in the 2002 _Strawberry Shortcake_ series.
-   Blip from _Space Ghost_.
-   Brain from _Inspector Gadget_. Mad Cat had his moments as well; how often does the Evil Genius tell his pet cat to launch the missiles, anyway?
-   In two of the _Superfriends_ cartoon series from the 70's, there were non-human sidekicks belonging to the "junior" superheroes. First, there was Wonderdog, sidekick to Wendy and Marvin in the original cartoon series. Then there was Gleek the monkey, sidekick to Zan and Jayna, the wonder twins.
-   During _The Fairly Oddparents_ Wishology trilogy, Mark is actually declared Timmy's sidekick.
-   _The Secret Saturdays_ - Zak has three - Komodo the komodo dragon, Fisk the gorilla-cat, and Zon the pteradactyl.
-   Liz from the _Magic School Bus_.
-   Zeek to Fishtronaut.
-   Jake the dog from _Adventure Time_.
-   The eponymous _Scooby-Doo_.
-   _Making Fiends_. Vendetta's sidekick is a giant hamster named Grudge.
    -   Also, one episode in the webseries, she had replaced grudge with another in-human sidekick, named Rubella.
-   _Invader Zim_ (who isn't human, but if the Doctor can be listed here, he can too) has his Robot Buddy GIR, and gains another - just before the series was cancelled - in Minimoose.
-   All three of Seth MacFarlane's animated series (_Family Guy, American Dad!,_ and _The Cleveland Show_) feature a Non Human Sidekick, who is also a Snarky Non-Human Sidekick most of the time. _Family Guy_ has Brian, Peter's talking dog and best friend. _American Dad_ has both Roger the alien and Klaus a goldfish with the brain of a German spy. And in _The Cleveland Show,_ Cleveland's best friend is a bear.
-   _Dynomutt, Dog Wonder_: Blue Falcon had Dynomutt.
-   _Futurama_: Fry has Bender; Zapp has Kif; Farnsworth has Zoidberg.
-   _South Park_:
    -   Mr. Garrison has Mr. Hat/Mr. Twig.
    -   Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
    -   Towelie.
    -   Jennifer Lopez/Mitch Conner (Cartman's hand puppet in "Fat Butt & Pancake Head").
    -   K-10, who, thanks to time distortions, later became KIT-9 and COCKA-3.
-   Bronx in the animated series _Gargoyles_ is an aversion to this trope according to Word of God, being unable to speak and rarely showing any emotion or intellectual understanding. Within the show, it is eventually revealed that Bronx behaves no differently than any muggle of his species. Fans generally agree, and don't like the suggestion of Bronx as a 'sidekick' in the sense of this trope.
-   Spike is this for Twilight Sparkle in _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_. Angel _might_ count as this for Fluttershy as well, as he seems worlds more intelligent than most of the other animals.
-   Peg has her feline pal Cat in their show _Peg + Cat_.
-   Djali in _The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Burbank Animation)_, of course. Also, Clopin has a green parrot.
-   _Defenders of the Earth_: Kisa (a panther) and Zuffy (a zuffoid) are the respective Non-Human Sidekicks of Jedda and Kshin.
-   Boots the monkey from _Dora the Explorer_.
    -   The spinoff _Go, Diego, Go!_, has Baby Jaguar.
-   _Steven Universe_ has Lion, Steven's...well, lion. Doubles as a Familiar.
-   Shows up in Filmation's _She-Ra: Princess of Power_. In order, we have:
    -   She-Ra had the winged unicorn Swiftwind, which by extension meant Adora had Spirit.
    -   White witch Madame Razz had her sentient broom... Broom.
    -   Bow had Kowl.
    -   Hordak even had a sidekick of his own in the form of Imp.
    -   Modulok tried to create his own. The first time failed thanks to his subject escaping, but the second resulted in his permanent sidekick, the robot Multi-Bot.
-   Even if not Japanese, Magical Girl type heroes must have cute critters as sidekicks and guides. In _Miraculous Ladybug,_ Ladybug and others like her have small critters called 'kwamis' that give them their powers by merging with the Transformation Trinket.
-   The _W.I.T.C.H._ team's sidekick is a 'passling' called Blunk who has the natural ability to find portals.
-   Beatrice the talking bird in _Over the Garden Wall_ is this to Wirt and Greg.

-   _Batman: The Brave and the Bold:_ AQUAMAN has Fluke, a Playful Dolphin. Batman absolutely _despises_ him, made worse by the fact Fluke follows him around like a puppy.
-   _Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous:_ Bumpy the _Ankylosaurus_ becomes this to Ben.
-   _A Thousand and One... Americas_: Lon, the yellow dog owned by Chris. Despite not being able to talk, he's very intelligent and has an optimal understanding of all the things Chris and other humans say (to him or otherwise). The two make up for a charming owner-pet duo, and also face all sorts of dangers in Chris' dreams.
