_"She take my money when I'm in need.  
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed.  
Oh, she's a gold digger way over town  
That digs on me."_

This is a character who hooks up with a rich partner (known as a Meal Ticket or Sugar Daddy), specifically to mooch off of said partner's money and status (usually in exchange for sex).

The digger is typically (but not always) female in modern shows, and often _much_ more attractive than her partner - in earlier eras, gold diggers often were men seducing rich heiresses, who then took advantage of the fact that laws of the time often stated that the man of the house controlled the finances, even when it was the wife's money. This may also overlap with All Women Are Prudes, resulting in the idea that the only reason women ever have sex is to gain access to a man's money and/or get men to buy them things, while the only reason men even bother to make money in the first place is so that they can have sex with lots of hot women. If this character _does_ enjoy sex for its own sake, she still doesn't necessarily want it from her husband, as it's not unknown for a Gold Digger to marry a man who can provide for her and then to sate her urges on the side with men to whom she's more genuinely attracted.

They usually get Distracted by the Luxury quite easily. Generally stunningly beautiful, to explain her success. Often a blonde whose hair is dyed. Once able to spend his money, she will be conspicuous about it. Expect lots of evening dresses and jewelry. Many a gold digger would be happy to marry a man who is old or in bad health, just so long as he'd be so kind as to leave at least some of his inheritance to his spouse when he dies. If he doesn't seem likely to die any time soon and the Gold Digger isn't also a Black Widow, she may instead seek to screw him over in a divorce settlement.

This is Older Than Steam and a subtrope of Sleeping Their Way to the Top. Compare Rich Suitor, Poor Suitor. Compare Friendship Bribe for a more PG-version of this trope, as those who go for said bribe are usually gold diggers. See also Trophy Wife, although the two don't _always_ overlap. Sometimes overlaps with Coattail-Riding Relative. Often overlaps with Beauty Breeds Laziness. There's also a degree of overlap with The Schlub Pub Seduction Deduction, when an unattractive guy is unable to figure out that the hot woman is only coming on to him for ulterior motives. The cardinal sin of the Gold Digger is Greed, though Lust and Gluttony (of the materialistic variety) also figure in.

For the opposite type of character, who definitely does _not_ want the rich beau's money, see Not with Them for the Money. Contrast Marry for Love.

**Important Note**: A gold digger is _almost never_ a Housewife. While both of them stay home, the gold digger has expensive tastes and refuses to dirty her hands. That's what maids are for. Children and family are almost never part of her priorities, unless she aims to use The Baby Trap to secure a marriage with (or child support from) her Meal Ticket. And if she does have children by him, don't expect her to be a very hands-on mother. That's what _nannies_ are for. The Housewife on the other hand, even though she may live off her husband's paycheck, will concern herself with running the home and raising the kids, money and luxury usually not being in her repertoire other than as byproducts.

For the comic book series, see _Gold Digger_. For the people who make a living actually digging up gold, see Prospector. Also has nothing with the _other_ kind of gold digging.

-   In Child Ballad 62 _Fair Annie_, Annie's long-term lover — and the father of her many children — goes to marry another woman for her dowry. When the bride arrives, she hears Annie's lament and reveals that Annie is her kidnapped sister; she makes over her own dowry to her, so she can marry him.
-   In Child Ballad _The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward_, the Duke of France offers a rich dowry with his daughter. The false steward posing as the young Lord of Lorn takes it without comment; it is the true lord who declares that he wants to marry the daughter more than the gold.
-   In Child Ballad 73 _Lord Thomas and Annet_, Lord Thomas, on his family's advice, marries for money.
    
    _The nut-browne bride haes gowd and gear,  
    Fair Annet she has gat nane;  
    And the little beauty Fair Annet haes  
    O it wull soon be gane._
    

    Comic Books 

-   In the four-part _Archie_ special "Veronica in Germany", said heiress travels to said country to visit her distant relatives, including her cousin Elke, who is engaged to a man named Wolf. Even though they are set to be married, Wolf suddenly becomes too interested in Veronica when she reveals her father's massive wealth and empire, arousing her suspicions when he starts taking her on private outings just the two of them while leaving his "beloved" fiancée at home. In the end, Veronica's suspicions are right, as Wolf breaks up with Elke after they fight over his over-friendliness with her cousin, and immediately jumps to romancing a Greek heiress.
-   Mrs. Geriatrix from _Asterix_ is a bit of a subversion. She is much younger than her husband, but he isn't particularly rich. Their marriage is happy, but there is always the status of being married to the oldest man in the village.
-   _Astro City_: Charles Williams' wife Darnice from the "Dark Ages" story arc. She flirts with anyone who has money, spends his earnings on personal luxuries, even encourages him to _take bribes_ as a way to supplement their income, then leaves him when he refuses to be a Dirty Cop.
-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: Subverted with Scrooge's love interest Brigitta McBridge: She sometimes looks like one, but she's actually a formidable businesswoman in her own right and genuinely loves Scrooge.
-   One of Doctor Octopus's old schemes was a variation. During his feud with the mobster Hammerhead, he actually proposed to Peter's Aunt May, not because she was wealthy (which she wasn't) but because she had unknowingly inherited an atomic plant that he wanted. Of course, Spider-Man got involved, the scheme culminating in a three-way fight between him, Doc Ock, and Hammerhead, the plant's destruction, and Ock becoming a destitute vagrant for a while.
-   In _Drowntown_, Gina Cassel doesn't care that her courier business doesn't bring her riches, and refuses help from her rich boyfriend, Vincent Drakenberg, on the grounds that she wants to keep her independence. This view is not shared by her partner in the business, Izzy, who tries to seduce Vincent herself. It doesn't work (or perhaps we just haven't seen it yet, since Izzy certainly seems to have prospered in the time since Gina's supposed death).
-   _Fables_ features two male examples.
    -   One of Jack's get rich quick schemes was to become a hero of the Civil War and then marry into a wealthy Southern family.
    -   Prince Charming makes his living mooching off his conquests, and attempts to renew his relationship with Briar Rose when he learns she has a blessing that keeps her wealthy.
-   _Katmandu_: The furry comic had a story where a villainous fortune hunter is about to marry the daughter of a rich man with every intent of sponging off him. Fortunately, a woman he cheated before has a friend who's a tailor and also a magician, who places a magic spell in his wedding suit to make him blab at the altar that he's only marrying the girl for her father's money. While the father is about to beat up the villain, the bride runs away in tears, but cheers up immediately when she runs into a very nice boy.
-   A _Krazy Kat_ comic had Ignatz finding out that Krazy stands to inherit a lot of money. He immediately begins to woo Krazy with poetry, candy, and mandolin music. When he finds out that Krazy isn't inheriting the money after all—and simultaneously gets billed for all the candy and poems—he returns to his usual practice of pelting Krazy with bricks, much to the Kat's relief.

-   _Maus_: Money seems like a probable reason for Vladek leaving the poor Lucia Greenberg for the wealthy Anja Zylberberg — although they do eventually truly fall in love.
-   _ORPHANIMO!!_: Ursula is one. She married (and divorced) Vallalkozo at some point prior to the series, and tries to marry Zemeckis only for their money. She even complains to her cat that Zemeckis should be spoiling her.
-   Red Sonja meets Laranda-fa, the Empress Dowager, who was a lowly if beautiful commoner before she married the emperor. Soon after the emperor was dead and Laranda-fa was free to spend his money and wield his power.
-   Ruby Elizabeth De Longe from an issue of _The Sandman (1989)_ is a particularly ambitious and cynically calculating example of this trope. Not content with merely finding a good Meal Ticket, she's determined to basically marry into Fiction 500. She had resolved to remain a virgin until this happened, and in the past, she dumped a guy who she really liked after doing a routine credit check on him and deciding that he wasn't wealthy enough. In the end, her determination is in vain, as she burns to death in a hotel room, still not rich, and still single.
-   Several of the female criminals confronting _The Spirit_ classify as such.
    -   The prime example is P'Gell. Her usual modus is to find a shady rich guy, work her wiles, get married to the same, and have the guy either disappear or get busted.
    -   Silk Satin, who turns more or less legit when she finds her missing daughter Hilde.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Blondie (1930)_: Yes, _that_ Blondie. Dagwood Bumstead, though you'd never know it to look at him today, started off as the rich and privileged heir to the Bumstead fortunes. His family cut him out of the will when he married Blondie Boopadoop(!), whom they believed to be a gold digger. To be fair, they might not have been entirely wrong at the time. The strip is called "Blondie", though Dagwood is clearly the more comedic character today, because originally it was about Blondie the flapper girl's crazy antics, with her then-boyfriend Dagwood playing straight man. After they got married and found themselves suddenly middle-class (at best), Blondie underwent a lot of character development.

    Fairy Tales 

-   Franz Xaver von Schönwerth's "Nine Bags Of Gold": Marie turns an arranged marriage down because she was warned that her father's proposed suitor will squander her money and then he will abandon her. Subverted, since the man is financially well-off but he would still mooch off her.

    Fan Works 

-   _Another Time, Another Place, Another Story_:
    -   Subverted with Liu Qingge. The Shen family first suspects him from preying on their sickly, isolated third son to escape his poverty-stricken background, but he genuinely was unaware of Shen Yuan's wealth and is actually embarrassed by the prospect of asking anything his friend could give him.
    -   Played entirely straight with Chen Baozhai. She's dating several men at once in order to maximimize the gifts she mooches off them, and decides to seduce Shen Yuan when she learns how wealthy his family is.
-   _Ask the Famous 8!_ has an interesting gender inverted double subversion with Gordon I. He originally married in order to expand his own wealth, but he changed his mind after he began feeling unconditional love for a Chinese woman, Lily Lu. After Lily's death giving birth to his son Gordon II, he reverted back to his old ways. At present, he is married to Lady Carmine Redferne, who hails from an even wealthier family, and has faint connections to The British Royal Family.
-   In _By Royal Command_, Twilight Sparkle gets depressed because she fears that anypony who'd show romantic interest in her would only do so because of her new princess status. When Rainbow Dash suggests that she could just take matters into her own hooves and pick a pony who won't care about such things, Twilight sets her sights on the one pony in Equestria guaranteed not to think highly of her for her new status: her self-appointed rival, Trixie.
-   _Christian Weston Chandler in Survivor: Kujira-Jima_ has Cass, who proudly admits in her first line of dialogue that she mooches large sums of money off of her boyfriend instead of finding gainful employment.
-   _Earth and Sky_: Prince Blueblood marries Diamond Tiara strictly so that he can have access to her wealth (having squandered his own). In a possible subversion, she's well aware of this, as _she_ only married _him_ to gain power and prestige.
-   This is somewhat deconstructed in _Flam Gush_ with Lady Monara. She's the sister of a wealthy merchant who badgered him into buying a noble title and then married herself off to a noble looking for a second wife (and step-mother for his daughter). Her marriage ends when another relative pulls a coup, and she has to flee back to her brother with her step-daughter in tow. Then she engineers another marriage for her brother, which is what gives the villains of the story the chance to act.
-   _In the Bleak Midwinter (TheLoud)_: When Tom gets to know the Prewetts a little, he suspects that they have invested a great deal of their modest resources (being only a branch family) in their daughter's appearance. The results are mixed; she falls for a wealthy and titled _Muggle_, which certainly wasn't part of their plans.
    
    Tom respected that investment plan. The payoff was potentially large, for a relatively small initial outlay.
    
-   Averted in the _Winx Club_ part of _The Infinite Loops_: Diaspro _thinks_ that Bloom is one due to how her romance with Sky started out, and that's what led her to do what she did attempting to save Sky and their homeworld from her. What's worse, from a royal's point of view her reasoning is sound enough that Stella and Aisha flat-out admit they would think the same had they not seen what actually happened...
-   The Weasleys in _Knowledge is Power_ are only interested in Harry so they can get their hands on his Gringotts vault, despite being far too proud to take his money in canon.
-   _Learning To Bloom_: All her life Weiss has dealt with guys who just want her because she's rich. When she falls for Neptune, Weiss thinks he's different, but it's implied that he's also into her for her name. He tries to get her to pay for their first lunch together under the excuse that he left his wallet in his dorm (only for him to "realize" he had it on him the entire time upon Weiss deciding to leave early). Neptune also likes bragging about dating Weiss, which makes her feel like a Trophy Wife. This quickly leads Weiss into falling out of her infatuation with him.
-   Limefrost Spiral in _Manehattan's Lone Guardian_ is noted as being one of these. She's already doing well financially, but she wants to do even better by marrying someone richer than she is. Unfortunately, her status as a Grade-A ditz renders her terrible at it, as she's yet to even _start_ a first date, though not for a lack of trying.
-   _The Many Dates of Danny Fenton_:
    -   Vicky from _The Fairly OddParents!_ goes on the 13th date with Danny, only to ditch him when she finds out he isn't rich.
    -   Bonnie Rockwaller from _Kim Possible_ becomes this to Danny in the fifth alternate ending, trying to steal him from Kim after his identity as Danny Phantom is revealed and she wants a rich boyfriend. His love for Kim and Bonnie originally dismissing him as a geek makes his disinterest clear.
-   Lila tries to do this with Damian in many _Maribat AU_ fics, only to fail miserably because of this trope and his love for Marinette.
-   In many _Miraculous Ladybug_ Post-Chameleon salt fics, Lila is portrayed as this, as she is only interested in being with Adrien because she wants the wealth, fame, and power that comes with being an Agreste. She also accuses Marinette of being this in order to make her look bad.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fandom:
    -   Character Fleur Dis Lee is either this or that to many fans and their fanfics. She is a young, model-like mare with a knack for posing who is seen hanging around (and clinging onto) the obviously much older aristocrat Fancy Pants.
    -   Some fans also interpreted Rarity as one during the events of _The Best Night Ever_ and actually sympathized with the rather charmless Prince Blueblood. There's even a fan theory that Blueblood is normally a nice guy (or at least not _that_ bad) but acts like an ass around women he thinks are only interested in him for this reason _to drive them away_.
-   _The New Retcons_:
    -   Frank Day and Stan Watson both end up viewing the woman that would become Elly Patterson as this, with some of The Baby Trap thrown in for good measure in Stan's case.
    -   Kortney Krelbutz starts out as this, dating and getting engaged to John Patterson (although there's a revenge element in it as well, since Elly didn't stand up for her when she was fired). She realizes she's fallen in love with him when he defends her against Connie.
-   _Not the intended use (Zantetsuken Reverse)_: Leon's first wife married him because she was under the impression he was rich due to being a Barron. Unfortunately for her, Leon had already given up his title by that point and was broke, so she left him.
-   _The Pieces Lie Where They Fell_: In the sequel _Picking up the Pieces_, Night Blade's brother Deep Blade mentions that he's had to deal with a few who wanted to marry into his family (who are nobles and thus rather wealthy and influential), and tried to manipulate him into making a relationship permanent. This is a big part of why he has a personal lawyer, to deal with ponies like that.
-   In _Stabilization_, Paolo's initial motive in asking for Amelia's hand is, indeed, like she suspects both here and in canon, her enormous fortune. What she doesn't know is that he doesn't want the money for himself – he plans to use it for the needs of Genoa.
-   In the _That's So Raven_ fic _Support_, Raven temporarily dated a girl who used her for presents and money. Raven doesn't mind fawning over lovers, but she found her to be annoyingly clingy. After less than a month, Raven separated from her by "forgetting" to tell her that she changed her phone number.
-   _Unbreakable Red Silken Thread_: Heather's mother is this played straight, and people sometimes mistake Heather for this until they find out she's actually the one with more money.
-   Subverted in _Unexpected Surprise_. Gabriel questions Marinette about who her daughter's father is, pointing out that she might be denied a promotion if she doesn't tell. When she still refuses, he drops the matter and promotes her anyway, satisfied that there are no Gold Digger intentions. He knows who the father is by then, but she does not.
-   _Universe Falls_ features an example of gold-digging by proxy; when Stan finds out a girl has feelings for Dipper in "Mismatched Making", he laughs it off as a joke. Then he finds out the girl in question is Pacific Northwest, heir to the uber-rich founding family of Gravity Falls, and realizes this is a chance for his family to be connected to wealth.
-   _With This Ring_: Hephaestus and Aphrodite never wanted to be married, but Zeus commanded it. She essentially ignored it and had a series of affairs, predominantly with Ares. However, when Hephaestaean defeats Zeus and Ares, and takes the throne, Aphrodite turns up and suddenly wants to make their marriage work (which would, naturally, make her Queen of Olympus). He turns her down, and issues the divorce that Zeus wouldn't grant.
-   _With this Ring... (Green Lantern)_: When detective Jonny Double is hired to investigate Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris' disappearance, his first theory is Hal wanted Carol's money, and her father disapproved of their relationship.
    
    The case seemed simple enough. Carol Ferris had run off with her lover, this hotdog test pilot. Her for love, him for money. Carl Ferris didn't want the guy's hands in his wallet. Maybe. But maybe it wasn't that simple.
    
-   _Your Alicorn Is in Another Castle_: From "Convectional Errors", one of the things that 'Prince' Vladimir Blueblood is immune to:
    
    for it turned out that even those generally willing to put up with near-endless demeaning in order to gain access to some level of wealth had their limits.
    

    Films — Animated 

-   _Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget_: Dr. Fry has a fortune and lots of land, but Mrs. Tweedy claims she actually fell in love with his mind... which, along with the other resources, provides the means to enact a lucrative business plan. She's also seen putting the moves on her prospective business partner Reginald Smith, targeting him as a future husband once Fry is no longer useful to her.
-   _Cinderella_:
    -   Lady Tremaine is a potential gold digger in that there is a conspiracy theory that she may have _murdered_ Cinderella's father, and may have even done the same to her _first_ husband, and Cinderella's _biological_ mother. This idea is brought forward even further in _Cinderella III: A Twist in Time_, because Lady Tremaine dismisses Anastasia's dicovery of what love is by saying that love isn't necessary when they can have power, which likely means that she just married first Anastasia and Drizella's father, and later Cinderella's widowed father for their wealth and power and disposed of them once they'd outlived their usefulness. You can't help but wonder what Lady Tremaine might have done if she had _succeeded_ in marrying one of her two biological daughters to the prince, _and worse still, what she may have done if she'd managed to dispose of both Cinderella and Anastasia, after her younger daughter had refused to marry the Prince_.
-   _Corpse Bride_:
    -   The Van Dorts and the Everglots are rather untraditional examples: both families are pushing their children into an Arranged Marriage to get at something the other family has. The Van Dorts want to marry into the aristocratic Everglot family so they can escape the stigma of being Nouveau Riche. The Everglots wish to use the Van Dorts' newfound wealth to restore their diminished fortune.
    -   Lord Barkis Bittern is a more typical — and murderous — example, wooing wealthy women so that he can kill them and steal their money.
-   Victor Quartermaine from _The Curse of the Were-Rabbit_. He's already a rich nobleman, but he was wooing Lady Tottington solely for her money.
-   _Frozen_: Hans only wants to marry Anna so that he can later murder her and her sister, take over Arendelle, and turn it into a dictatorship. All because he's 13th in line for his kingdom's throne, and really hates his family (a later tie-in novel, though, gives him a believable Freudian Excuse).
-   In _Gay Purr-ee_, the money-obsessed Meowrice advises his henchcats to marry out of love... for money.
-   _The Queen's Corgi_: At first, attractive female cocker spaniel Wanda is interested in Tyson because of his high social status among the other dogs, then switches to supporting Rex as soon as she finds out he's royalty. However, it's implied she genuinely falls in love with him by the end of the film.
-   Lola the seductive lionfish from _Shark Tale_. In her intro scene, she even calls herself superficial and dismisses Oscar calling him "cute, but a nobody." The Ludacris and Bobby V song "Golddigger" even plays over in the scene. When Oscar becomes the Sharkslayer, Lola is immediately interested in him and begins dating him, much to Angie's jealousy and dismay. When Oscar finishes a Sharkslayer stunt, Lola forcefully kisses him in front of the cameras, causing Angie to leave in jealousy, anger, and sadness. When Angie confesses Oscar her love for him, Oscar rethinks his feelings and dumps Lola -— which, unfortunately, leads to her great fury as she mercilessly slams him against the windows. Lola then arranges Don Lino to kidnap Angie, even gleefully threatening her life if Oscar doesn't comply.
    
    **Lola:** You know, Sharkslayer. There's only _one_ thing I like better than money: _**Revenge!**_
    
-   _Strange Magic_: Roland, who's only marring Marianne because she's the princess and he wants the armies that come with it.
-   In _Turning Red_, Ming believes the character Siu-Jyu in the _Jade Palace Diaries_ to be this.
    
    **Ming:** She's just using him to get to the throne.

    Radio 

-   _Adventures in Odyssey_:
    -   It turns out that nearly every member of Wooten Basset's extended family (except his benevolent Christian paternal grandparents) is this, as shown in "Basset Hounds". The episode follows Wooten (and Bernard) as they go to said grandparents' mansion in Alaska, as the grandparents are permanently moving to Africa for mission work and have gathered up the entire family to say good-bye, as well as having made a will. Bernard talks with several of the various family members there, and quickly finds out that the only reason most of them are there is to figure out how much Grandpa Basset is leaving them, even though a large number of them are already pretty wealthy. They even claim to be either Christians and/or active in charities, hoping this will result in Grandpa giving them even more money. When they hear Grandpa's final message to them via video-tape, they even fast-forward all the way to the disbursement. Karma hits them all like a load of bricks when it turns out that Grandpa was fully aware of their money-hungry tendencies despite how filthy-rich they already are and has left them nothing as a result. The only ones who get anything are Wooten <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and his cousin Wilma <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , with the rest of the money and Grandpa's mansion going to a charity he has started, to everyone else's chagrin.
    -   In the early 2016 episode "No Cause for Concern", Wooton's fiance Penny sees whom she thinks is Wooton doing a search for her public records<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , only for it to be revealed that it was Wooton's twin brother Wellington that was doing the snooping in order to prove that Penny was a gold digger due to Penny's previous boyfriend having also been wealthy and Penny being in a sizeable amount of debt, only for Wooton to explain that Penny had already told him about those issues.
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: In "Marriage Madness", the butcher's new business partner tries to marry Mrs. Davis for her money. It seems as if he's been often married, starting with the time in school he ran off with his French teacher.
    
    **Miss Brooks**: If he had said English teacher, I would have screamed!
    

    Standup Comedy 

-   Discussed in Whitney Cummings' standup. She says she has very little sympathy for men who complain about gold diggers, since, she points out, the problem can very easily be avoided by dating women who are old and successful enough to have their _own_ gold.
    
    _Maybe stop dating 18-year-olds that need a Kickstarter campaign just to eat dinner. Maybe just date adults, with jobs!_
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   Not a few petty-scale villains of Victorian melodrama, as mentioned in the _Forgotten Futures_ supplement "Victorian Villainy", are some variety of "fortune hunter" who is after the Romantic Lead, who is usually the heiress to some vast fortune that the villain wants to get his greedy hands on.
-   _Eberron_: There was a period where something very much like this was popular amongst elves, who would find a wealthy human in need of a spouse, usually a noble, and marry them, the idea being that since elves live _much_ longer than humans, eventually the elf would inherit. This tapered off when it became widespread knowledge that humans and elves were interfertile, but by then there were already enough half-elves around to sustain themselves as a distinct race.

    Theater 

-   _Carmen_: Mercédès, during the fortune-telling number, sees herself becoming the wife of a wealthy but senile man — and then, as his widow, inheriting magnificently.
-   _Craig's Wife_: Harriet admits straight up that she married her husband because she wanted a rich household and Mr. Craig had money. Her motives are explained — her father divorced her mother for a second wife, leaving Harriet and her mother and sister with nothing — but she is still a cold and villainous character.
-   Large Ham Don Jerome in the opera _La Duenna_ by Roberto Gerhard, though he comes to love his wife and really misses her when she dies.
-   In _The Grand Duke_ by Gilbert and Sullivan:
    -   Julia agrees to marry Ernest even though she hates him, because he's going to usurp the Grand Duke's throne and she wants to be Grand Duchess. When Ludwig becomes Grand Duke instead she insists on marrying _him_.
    -   Rudolph and Caroline are an unusual example — they're _mutual_ gold-diggers. Each is a rich miser who wants to marry the other in order to become even richer. They are quite frank with each other about this, and while they actually are affectionate to each other, it's clear that this is only because of the money.
-   A male version in _Hamilton_: Angelica Schuyler immediately deduces upon meeting him that Alexander Hamilton is one of these, as he's from a poor no-name family and must marry to gain the status and wealth he needs for his political ambitions. She's attracted to him anyway, but directs him to her sister Eliza, who fell in Love at First Sight with him.

-   In Molière's play _The Imaginary Invalid_ (also translated as _The Hypochondriac_), Beline, Argan's second wife, is a two-faced woman: she flatters and pampers her husband, but schemes all the time, trying to figure out how to get all his money after his death, and she wants to deprive his two daughters from his first marriage of their share.
-   _Kiss Me, Kate_:
    -   Petruchio not only admits outright several times that he only wants Kate's money, but he has an entire song about it.
    -   Just to even things out, Lilli Vanessi (not Kate) is planning to marry at least in part for status (in the stage show, her fiancé is a retired General who is intended to be the next Vice-Presidential candidate) or money (in the movie, he's a wealthy Texas cattle baron).
-   In _A Little Night Music_, Mme. Armfeldt, at the end of her life, fondly recalls the profitable dalliances with wealthy aristocrats that allowed her to die a very wealthy woman.
-   _The Merchant of Venice_ is full of male versions.
    -   Bassanio wants to marry Portia in part because she's wealthy and Portia's father had set up the whole "three caskets" thing to assure that she doesn't get stuck with one. Like everything William Shakespeare, this is up for interpretation. Some productions have Bassanio marrying Portia entirely for her money, some have him marry her because he loves her, with her money an obstacle, and some play around in the space between the two.
    -   The text suggests that this is a big part of Lorenzo's interest in marrying Jessica. Depending on the production, it may be more or less obvious.

-   Older Than Steam: Petruchio of _The Taming of the Shrew_ says outright that he wants to marry Katherine for her money.

    Theme Parks 

-   _The Haunted Mansion_: Constance the ghostly bride married and decapitated about five men for their wealth.

The last husband was one of the Mansion's owners — the Imagineers specifically modeled his appearance after "George" from the Portrait Room.

    Video Games 

-   Annie of _Atelier Annie: Alchemists of Sera Island_ dreams of falling into a life of easy luxury by "marrying up" before her family sends her lazy rear end off to work as an alchemist. Once she finds out that the prize for her efforts could include the Prince's hand in marriage she becomes _incredibly_ determined.
-   _Bitlife_: You may choose to have your character be this, only marrying people for their money.
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_: A variant occurs within dwarven society. Dwarves have a very strict caste system that determines each dwarf's profession, with casteless dwarves filling the very bottom rung, and ways up are _extremely_ limited- the only sure way to do it is to be named a Paragon for doing something badass that would put you in the history books (the only current Paragon managed to invent an efficient and smokeless fuel, saving dwarves from smoke-related illnesses and increasing productivity, and a historical Paragon mastered the skills of all castes). Female casteless dwarves commonly opt for an easier-but-risky alternative known as "noble hunting", where they seduce a male dwarf noble and have his child. Caste is determined by the same-gender parent, so if the noble hunter has a boy, then that boy is a noble and will be adopted into his father's house along with his mother. The risk factor is that if the baby is a girl, then the mom gains nothing, she's unlikely to catch another noble, and now she's a Struggling Single Mother. The Dwarf Commoner's sister Rica is a noble hunter, though only because she's forced into it by the crime boss her family works for. She can get her happy ending when she gets with Prince Bhelen, who genuinely loves her and intends to marry her, caste-less or not.
-   _Dragon Quest IV_: Maya has expressed interest in richer men regardless of age, drooling at the prospect of swimming in gold.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   Charlotte's profile in _Fire Emblem Fates_ states directly that her dream is to "marry into wealth" and that she makes herself look sweet and cute in order to "get men to spoil her." She turns out to be a more benevolent version and possible deconstruction, as she wants the money to support her very poor but beloved Good Parents, uses her Gold Digger facade to mask her deep issues, and if she _does_ get a Love Confession from a wealthy enough guy she'll wonder if she _actually_ likes the guy enough rather than his cash or his Blue Blood, sometimes even _rejecting_ the prospect boyfriend's proposal at first. Furthermore, while being wealthy is a priority, it's not the only criteria she has. If money is the only thing a man has to offer Charlotte (as opposed to being a decent person), she'd rather walk away.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ adds Dorothea as another sympathetic case. A former Street Urchin who only escaped poverty by being recruited by an opera troupe, she knows her looks and voice won't last forever and explicitly joined the Academy to get close to a bunch of nobles and possibly find a wealthy husband before she grows old and ends up poor and alone again. So in a violent contrast to the standard, greed-driven examples, she ends up being one of the nicer and more empathic members of the cast... which results in awkward situations sometimes, like when she snaps at Lorenz for his views on prioritizing social status over everything else, only to apologize when he points out she's doing the exact same thing.
-   In Data Age's _Journey Escape_ for the Atari 2600, groupies that resemble hearts with legs must be avoided at all costs, as running into them causes you to lose cash.
-   In the _Kindergarten 2_ mission "Flowers for Diana", the protagonist has to hook Alpha Bitch Cindy up with Token Rich Student Felix Huxley in order to get a flower required to complete the mission. After he does so, Cindy will gush over what a "walking goldmine" her new boyfriend is. Of course, Felix himself is a Rich Bastard who's just as nasty as Cindy herself, if not more so, and who only agreed to the whole thing because he thinks having a partner will make him more appealing to potential investors, so there's little sympathy to be had for him.
-   _Leisure Suit Larry_:
    -   Fawn in _Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards_, who dumps Larry after receiving a lot of gifts from him, including a diamond ring.
    -   _Leisure Suit Larry 7: Love for Sail!_: Larry's main Love Interest in the previous game (who was a rich Granola Girl) suddenly turns into this trope after sleeping with Larry. She chains him to the bed and leaves with his wallet. His primary pursuit in _this_ game (Captain Thygh) also turns out to be this, not to mention the Black Widow in the game who hires Larry to off her husband. Of course, neither Thygh nor Larry have any intention for a long-term relationship, but when Larry wins the contest, she refuses to honor her end of the deal until he shows her how much money he has.
-   _Max Payne 3_ has Fabiana Branco, who's way younger than her husband Rodrigo Branco, head of the Branco construction conglomerate. The two have an unspoken arrangement where he gets to parade her around as a Trophy Wife at the various parties he throws to make connections with Sao Paulo's rich and elite while she gets to live it up on her husband's dime in the various parties and nightclubs around the city. It also makes her a Damsel in Distress when she becomes a kidnapping target because of her being married to Rodrigo, who despite knowing that "she does not love (him) for (his) body" still does care about her well-being when she is shanghaied.
-   In _NBA Ballers: Phenom_, Kimberly, the player's ex-girlfriend, is implied to be one; as she left him to get with Hot Sauce after he gets a basketball contract, and only gives him the time of day when he starts making money and connections with Ludacris and some of the NBA players. Luda wisely warns him to stay away from her after she disses you for Hot Sauce a second time, and sets him up with his assistant instead.
-   Many of the mistresses in _Overlord_, particularly Velvet in the first game and Juno in the second. A big part of either game is acquiring enough wealth so that you can afford to decorate your Tower with things that please the mistress.

-   In _Private Eye_ Leppin's ex-wife Charlotte's first words to him were "How rich are you?"
-   In _Ratchet: Deadlocked_ Courtney Gears gets pissy over her boyfriend Reactor being a Nice Guy and nearly leaves him, only for her to come back to him after he becomes a rich Gladiator.

-   _The Sims_:
    -   In _The Sims 2_, Dina Caliente is implied to be this. She married Michael Bachelor and has the memory of "Married a Rich Sim", and he died before the game started. When the game starts, she's in love with Mortimer Goth, who is also very rich.
    -   In _The Sims 3_ "Gold Digger" is a Lifetime Aspiration. To achieve it, sims have to marry someone worth a certain amount of money, and then have their spouse die and see their ghost.

    -   The Contessa married an aristocrat for his money and estate, then poisoned him a few weeks after the wedding.
    -   Penelope fell for Sly, and later Bentley, for the treasures in the Cooper Vault, but when Dr. M put a halt to that, she decided to use Bentley's skills as a money maker instead, which backfires when he finds out and dumps her.
-   Lola Tigerbelly, the main Love Interest of _The Spellcasting Series_. In fact, Ernie has to give her a literal pile of gold to get her attention in the second game. For bonus points, if you play the love song for her on the moodhorn, she hugs a nearby cash register.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   Rutee Katrea from _Tales of Destiny_, who does it to get her orphanage out of debt.
    -   Anise Tatlin from _Tales of the Abyss_, who is trying to shovel her family out of debt. This does not even vaguely compensate for the fact that she's 13 years old.
-   Jo'on Yorigami from _Touhou Project_ is a pestilence goddess who uses her ability to cause Conspicuous Consumption to get people to spend all their money on her, and initially doesn't even care whether the people she steals from can afford to lose what they spend on her.
-   Jokichi Yudasei of _Yandere Simulator_ has aspirations of marrying into a wealthy family, which is why he's attracted to the occasional woman who's...less than ideal (namely, Rich Bitch Ritsuko).

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   Alita Tiala is a particularly cruel version, as she's not only marrying Wocky Kitalki for his family's money, she's also covering up the fact that Wocky is living on borrowed time due to a bullet near his heart that her boss failed to remove. She plans to woo him, marry him, let him die, and then collect his money. She's also willing to frame him for her murder of Pal Meraktis.
    -   Desiree DeLite certainly _seems_ like one at first, as her spending habits cause her husband to become a Phantom Thief just to keep money in her purse, which puts him in a sticky situation since he's afraid if the money stops coming she'll leave him, but she also despises criminals, so if she ever finds out how he's getting the money she'll _definitely_ leave him. However, it turns out that she genuinely loves him, money or not. She doesn't even particularly mind his thievery, since he announces all of his heists in advance unlike the cowardly criminals she hates.
-   In _Higurashi: When They Cry_, Rina Mamiya and her pimp Teppei Hojou plan to scam Rena's father for a large quantity of money, apparently up to _at very least_ one million yen. It _never_ goes well for her, since Rena is so determined to protect herself and her father that she **bloodily** kills her more than once.
-   In _Mystic Messenger_, Jumin considers all the women his father (an extremely wealthy business tycoon) has dated to be this. It doesn't help that on Jumin's route, his father's current squeeze tries to manipulate him into marrying his son off to her sister to get them to purchase her failed company. Constantly gushing over Jumin's wealth is also one of the most surefire ways for the player character to lose affection points with him.

-   In _Jupiter-Men_, Binny tries to act all chummy with Nathan to try to get on his good side and become his guardian so she can take over his finances. But it's blatantly clear to him that her "nice" behavior is all an act and she admits it to his face that she simply won't leave while there's money on the table. Since he can't get rid of her, he instead bribes her by letting her live in his penthouse rent-free and getting a $6,000 monthly allowance from his personal funds in exchange for not touching his finances, not inviting anyone over, and staying out of his hair.

-   _Shotgun Shuffle_: Cinnamon, most likely. The only thing really mentioned about her boyfriend before he dumped her is that he was rich. Given Cinnamon's personality, it is quite likely she dated him for his money.
-   In _Winter Moon_, Risa is a priest in an MMORPG who prefers to charm males into giving her free stuff rather than earn her gear and experience points. This hits a snag when she encounters an extremely powerful homosexual mage who's more interested in frying her for her impertinence and using her as his "slave healer."

Buckley points out that: a. With two failed marriages behind him, the man's refusal to give her unrestricted access to his money is most likely him learning from experience, and b. If it's money she's after, she should have married someone with no kids to share her future inheritance with.
-   _Dragonball Z Abridged_ paints Maron as this. While in the original show, she's a ditzy airhead who genuinely likes Krillin (even if they don't end up together), here, she is portrayed as only being with "Juan Sanchez" to get ahold of his newly-inherited life insurance payoff from his death on Namek. Her Establishing Character Moment is to appear, exclaim that she broke a nail and then ask for a thousand dollars, to which "Juan" eagerly gives here two. It's later revealed she's an investigator who was trying to make sure Krillin's story was genuine, but she still kept all the money Krillin gave to her, forcing him to crash at Kame house for the rest of the Cell Saga.

-   In _Gargoyles_, Demona and her new lover, Thailog, take advantage of her new human form to try and do this to Macbeth; since they can't kill him, they would just lock him in his own dungeon forever and take his cash. Of course, in this case the money would have been used to fund much worse offenses.
