_"A horse, or something built around the same general plan, was coming down the street at a hard gallop. Its hooves did not make the pocking noise of iron horseshoes. Bud realized it was a chevaline — a four-legged robot thingy."_

A Horse of a Different Color indeed — and an entirely different nature. Combining the coolness of a horse with the tireless reliability of a machine, the Mechanical Horse is, at its most basic level, a motorbike with legs. (If it _doesn't_ have legs, see My Horse Is a Motorbike.) The Mechanical Horse will usually be a robot, but some Steampunk universes feature _clockwork_ horses. This is a mechanised version of the Diligent Draft Animal when the horse is used for carrying loads.

The idea is not quite as ludicrous as it sounds. Biological horses can walk on vastly more kinds of terrain than a wheeled vehicle (not to mention they are perfectly amphibious), and it would be quite useful if there were a machine that could do the same thing. But engineers find it very challenging to overcome all of the problems with moving around on legs, on any uneven surface, without falling down. As an odd example, the US military once funded experimentation into a "walking truck", a horse-like machine designed as an all-terrain mount and transport. _(It looks really weird.)<small>◊</small>_

Not to be confused with horses treated like machines, the identically-named vintage vehicle, or a type of kiddie ride. A really big mechanical horse with some of the animal traits taken away and some weapons added is basically a Spider Tank.

Sub-Trope to Mechanical Animals.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _B't X_: X and Shadow, although Kirin, are essentially Cool Mechanical Horses — ones that let you breath in space.
-   The Count in _Gankutsuou_ has a hovering carriage drawn by mechanical horses.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   _SD Gundam_ frequently features mechanical horses due to its heavy use of samurai and knight settings. Some characters (such as Musha Zeta and Knight Gundam), even have centaur forms where they can combine with their steed. Perhaps topping them all, Ryofu Tallgeese in the current (as of early 2009) series SD Gundam BB Senshi Sangokuden has a powerful robotic horse that can also transform into a motorbike.
    -   _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_ gives us Fuunsaiki, a Mecha horse piloted by an _actual_ horse.
    -   _SD Gundam Force_ gives us two — well, three examples, all originating from the country of Ark, which has influences from _G Gundam_ and the Musha Gundam series';
        -   The first is Entengo, Bakunetsumaru's steed, widely believed to be an Expy of Fuunsaiki.
        -   Next are the horses pulling Kibaomaru's chariot Oshogo. According to the Zako Zako Hour, their names are Kakuryu and Hiryu. Given that Kibaomaru is an Expy of the Zeus Gundam, it's more than likely that Oshogo is a reference to the Hercules Chariot used by that Gundam.
-   _Mazinger Z_: Baron Ashura sometimes rides a large, pink, mechanical horse (seen for first time in episode 17). His Iron Mask troops also use mechanical horses in some scenes. In _Shin Mazinger_, the Iron Masks also ride robotic horses.
-   _Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs_: Saber Rider's Steed and April's Nova.

    Asian Animation 

-   The _Motu Patlu_ episode "Robot Horse", as suggested by its title, has Motu and Patlu borrowing a robotic horse from Dr. Jhatka to replace the real horse they used to replace their bikes. The robotic horse, unlike the real horse, doesn't annoy people by eating their vegetables and crops... actually, it annoys people by eating jewelry, and the villain John the Don uses this to his advantage by hijacking the robot horse.

    Audio Plays 

-   In the _Big Finish Doctor Who_ play _Spare Parts_, it's revealed that the Cybermen had first cyberconverted horses. The result is a Hellish Horse, as by Cyberman norm, it's a corpse laden with cybernetics.

    Card Games 

    Comic Books 

-   _The Beano_: "The Horse that Jack Built" was a comic strip back in The '40s about a boy and the robot horse he had built. Made more amazing by the fact that the story was set in the middle ages.
-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: In a _Paperinik_ story (**not** from _Paperinik New Adventures_), Gyro Gearloose creates one for the eponymous hero after Scrooge McDuck confiscates Donald's car.
-   _Iron Man_: One of Obadiah Stane's Chessmen, the Knight, has a mechanical flying horse.

-   The mine-robbers that the four encounter in _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_ ride six clockwork robotic horses that combine into a Humongous Mecha that kicks Paul about 300 feet away.
-   _The Myth of Link & Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ adapts the namesake game, including the various DLCs, such as "The Champions' Ballad". At the end of it, Link fights Monk Maz Koshia and earns the Master Cycle Zero, which just as in canon, is unicorn-shaped. Except this time, there's also Divine Beast Vah Eponia, named for Link's loyal horse throughout the ages, and the Divine Beast of nature which is also shaped like a massive horse. Monk Maz Koshia serves as its pilot in place of Link by whom the beast is meant to be piloted.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Animatrix_ has a few robots riding robotic "horses" into combat in _The Second Renaissance: Part II_. One scene has a Machine ride a mechanical "horse" while blowing a trumpet before finally falling. As with the later Machines (such as sentinels), the "horse" only resembles a horse in general form and design.
-   _Doraemon: Nobita's Dorabian Nights_: The gang meet Sinbad (a Retired Badass in this incarnation), who owns various artifacts from the Arabian Nights stories, including the Ebony Horse from the Arabian Nights tale of the same name which turns out to be a mechanical flying animal. The final battle notably has Sinbad riding the horse and battling the main villain, Abdil, on the rooftops as Sinbad's castle takes flight.
-   In _Hugo the Hippo_, the sultan's magician conjures up a metal horse and cowboy to lasso some hippos after the horse, obviously, drains the body of water they live in with a vacuum snout.

-   According to _Santa Claus (1959)_, our hero's sleigh is pulled by hideous giggling clockwork reindeer.
-   A clockwork horse features prominently in _The Thief of Bagdad (1940)_, based on the _Arabian Nights_ example. Jaffar offers it to the Sultan of Basra, a toy collector, in exchange for his daughter. (_See also_ Literature, _below._)
-   The horses in the _Westworld_ film are very life-like, but are actually robots, much like their humanoid counterparts. During one particular scene set at the robot repair lab, we can see a few inanimate horses lying on large operating tables, waiting for repairs along with the human robots and other animal robots.

    Gamebooks 

-   The _Fighting Fantasy_ book _Portal of Evil_ features a flying metal horse which is owned by the Wizard of the Lake. He gives you (the PC) a ride on it.

    Literature 

-   Older Than Print: One of the _Arabian Nights_ stories features a clockwork horse. (_See also_ Film, _above._)
-   _Ascendance of a Bookworm_: Members of the Supernatural Elite can make highbeasts, which are essentially magic-powered moving statues that look like winged horses. Some people give them the form of the winged version of another ridable animal, making Horse of a Different Color quite common.
-   _The Canterbury Tales_: Obviously drawing on the _Arabian Nights_ tale, in the "The Squire's Tale", Chaucer tells of a very similar steed being gifted to Genghis Khan alongside other wondrous items.
-   Bronze, the Steel General's steed in _Creatures of Light and Darkness_, is a magically enhanced mechanical horse that can ride through space. With each step it takes, it travels twice as far as the previous. It is said that with a sufficient run-up, it could circumnavigate the universe in a single stride.
-   _Crest of the Stars_: There is a robotic horse children guide (along with other robotic animals) in a theme park. The protagonists enlist its help in escaping, resulting in a Chase Scene.
-   _The Dark Side of the Sun_ features robot horses on a world of nothing but Mechanical Lifeforms. The horses are sapient, and have a philosophical outlook on life.
-   In _Dave Barry Slept Here_, the "Iron Horse" that was used to pull heavy loads before being replaced by the locomotive is implied to be one of these, since it had the drawback of producing "Monster Piles of Iron Droppings".
-   _The Diamond Age_ has mechanical horses; one of the main characters is given one with directions preprogrammed into it as a way of taking him to a secret location. Interesting in that they're specifically mentioned as being capable of using different gaits: galloping like a horse on smooth, level terrain, but more like a big cat when walking on steep, uneven terrain.
-   In _Infinite Dendrogram_, there are a series of mechanical steeds known as Prism Steeds, created by an ancient civilization. While there are replicas in the modern age, the original series are both rare and valuable enough that a player could be murdered over it.
-   In _Making Money_, the horses are golems — clay automatons — and the only one to ride them notes just how uncomfortable a terra cotta saddle is. That one character reasons that, since (some) golems _can_ talk (it partially has to do with how they're "built"), then... why can't a golem horse? So he asks one what it wants, and gets an answer: permission to actually **act** like a horse, including time to just run around, and occasionally roll around in fields.
    
    _"...'Give me Livery, or Give Me Death'."_
    
-   _The NeverEnding Story_: Xayide created hollow metal horses that she could control with her mind. Bastian, due to Auryn, could also control these horses and rode one away from a battle until it shattered from overuse.
-   The Hephaestus cabin from _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ make some mechanical horses for a chariot race.
-   Bas-Lag, the world of _Perdido Street Station_, includes Remade (cyborg) horses as well as criminals.
-   "The Quest for Saint Aquin", a 1951 short story by Anthony Boucher, has the priest protagonist using an artificially intelligent "robass" ("robot ass") which happened to be an atheist. The story takes place in a post-nuclear war United States where roads are in poor repair, hence the need for an automated horse rather than Automated Automobiles (though the robass does have wheels it can deploy if the surface allows).
-   Halidarre the mechanical pegasus in the _Robotech: The Sentinels_ novels.
-   The steam elephant from _The Steam House_ is an early example.
-   _Strata_ features a mechanical horse _that can fly._ The book says it runs on magic.
-   _Sword Art Online_: Among _Gun-Gale Online_'s in-game vehicles are robotic horses. In an amusing inversion of Automaton Horses, they are fully robotic, but notorious for being more temperamental than actual horses, to the point where players who can ride in real life can't get them to listen.
-   In the _Tales of the Magic Land_ book _The Fiery God of the Marrans_, there are two mechanical mules built by Alfred Canning for Annie Smith and her friend Tim O'Kelly. The children name them Caesar and Hannibal and ride them to the Magical Land, where the mechanical mounts become alive and, like the dog Totoshka, are able to talk.
-   _Vampire Hunter D_ has a Cool _Cyborg_ Horse, as the stories are set in 12,000 A.D. However, the novels state that his cyborg horses (he goes through several) are just standard model with nothing special about them in the context of the setting, but he somehow manages to make them incredibly fast and agile just by sitting on their back.
-   In the _Warlock of Gramarye_ series, this overlaps with Sapient Steed, as the main character's horse, Fess, is a highly intelligent AI placed in a mechanical horse.
-   _Wolves of the Calla_: The "wolves" that kidnap children from the town of Calla Bryn Sturgis every generation appear as wolf-masked riders, but are actually robots mounted on mechanical horses.

    Live-Action TV

GARO, ZERO and DAN's horses are named Gouten,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Ginga<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and Hayate<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  respectively. It's still unknown how KIBA obtains his horse Raigou, though.
-   Parodied in _Home Movie: The Princess Bride_ for David Oyelowo's turn as Humperdinck, which has him for the scene where he rides up on horseback to send Westley to the Pit of Despair. Except instead of a horse, Oyelowo rides up in a golf cart, and exits stage left by putting the golf cart in reverse and backing out of frame.
-   In _Mahou Sentai Magiranger_ and its counterpart _Power Rangers Mystic Force_, The Dragon has a Hellish Horse from the underworld that can grow giant, and turn into a horse mecha. He can combine with it to form a mecha-centaur, and then _further_ combine with it to form a horse-based Megazord. The Hero can form this Megazord as well, and they later one-upped themselves by giving him his own mecha _unicorn._ A later villain has a chariot pulled by two similar mecha-horses.
-   In _Westworld_, the artificial horses are built in much of the same manner as their human counterparts and consist largely of tissues similar to organic ones, operated by a control unit in their skull. Like all animals in the Delos parks, they are of a lower intelligence than the humanoid hosts. They exhibit typical horse-like behaviour, but don't seem vulnerable to the simulated ammunition ("simunition") used by park guests and the parks' host characters.

    Music & Music Videos 

    Tabletop Games

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Lord Robilar in the _Greyhawk_ setting (one of the original characters in the setting, created while Gary Gygax was playtesting the game) rode a mechanical destrier (a magically animated horse automaton).
    -   3rd Edition includes "stone horses," Living Statues that serve whoever speaks their command word. They have the game stats of heavy horses and the Damage Reduction of stone.
    -   Equine golems are crafted from hardwood and can gallop non-stop without tiring, though anyone who tries to ride one for more than eight hours a day is going to be fatigued since their mount doesn't flex beneath them like a living horse.
    -   Clockwork steeds were introduced in a late 3rd Edition _Monster Manual_, and boast a suspension system that makes them more comfortable to ride than equine golems, have a variety of optional upgrades such as combat features and additional armor, and are so easy to handle that even a novice rider can control them. The downside is that if their rider ever becomes incapacitated, the clockwork steed will immediately come to a halt, and they'll obey the commands of _any_ rider, such as a thief who shoved their unconscious owner out of the saddle.
    -   The _Eberron_ campaign setting features automaton horses.
-   In _Exalted_, some characters can create horse-like constructs of bonded magical energy, or own magitek constructs as steeds.
-   _Rifts_ features both Robot and Bionic horses (Yes, as in real horses turned into Cyborgs). They've proven to be extremely popular for the companies that make them (Rule of Cool is a very real market force among post-post-apocalyptic adventurers and mercenaries), to the point that some are making fantastical variations like Unicorn(with a silver-plated vibro-blade horn), Pegasus(functional wings, but held aloft by hover thrusters), Sea Horse, and Monster.
-   _Warhammer_ features the mechanical steed. This is sufficiently ridiculous for even the distinctively over-the-top Warhammer world that many Empire players consider it Fanon Discontinuity. Empire army book author Graham McNeill considers it the Empire's attempt to invent the car. Oh, and it _shoots lightning from its eyes_.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   In addition to fully robotic mounts, there are heavily augmented bionic horses, cyber-wolves and cyber-_boars_.
    -   Mogul Kamir of the Attilan Rough Riders was gifted such a horse by the Adeptus Mechanicus. He was known for previously riding a lot of horses to death.
    -   Speaking of the Mechanicus, in 2020 they received a fully playable example of this trope in the form of the Serberys Cavalry, available in two flavours: the Serberys Raiders and their clawed robot horses, and the Serberys Sulphurhounds, who are more partial to fire-breathing robot _greyhounds_.

    Toys

-   The Defiant faction in _Rift_ can get "eldritch steeds", which play the trope straight with Magitek.
-   _Robot Unicorn Attack_ has... well, robot unicorns, providing the current page image.
-   The Aussenseiter in _Super Robot Wars_ is piloted by a person, but transforms into a horse. All together now: "Real Men Ride Each Other".
-   One of the challenges in _Syberia II_ is how to repair a group of horse automata (no, not Automaton Horses!) that "dance" on stage in a tavern. They can't be ridden anywhere, but they're kinda fun to watch.
-   _Them's Fightin' Herds_ has a mechanical horse that sometimes appears in the background of the Salt Mines stage. This character is a backer reward who was based on the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfiction character Turing Test.

-   At one point in _Homestuck_, Rufioh was seriously injured. In order to save him, his boyfriend Horuss built him a mechanical body — and because Horuss has a creepy horse obsession, he made the body in the shape of a mechanical horse so Rufioh would better fit Horuss' ideal vision.
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_, Galatea spends much of "The Island and the Idol" ark trying to get a powerful being to give her a flying pony. He never does... but at the end of the story arc, she actually does get a _mechanical_ pegasus, and seems reasonably happy with it.

-   _Futurama_: In one of the twists in "31st Century Fox", not only are the fox and the dogs robotic, but so are the horses that the fox hunters ride on; the horses even work as helicopters and can validate parking.
-   The fan-favorite _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)_ episode "Origin of the Sorceress" features Stridor, Man-At-Arms' hand-built robot mount for He-Man, which Cringer/Battle Cat views with no small amount of distaste. It even gets a Heroic Sacrifice\-turned-Disney Death fighting a villain called... wait for it... Morgoth the Terrible.

    Real Life 

-   One of the early projects of _automobile_, back in the 1800s, included a _papier-mâché_ wheeled horse with engine inside. The idea was to make it less scary to other horses (and some of the more conservative folks as well). Here's some proof. Seriously... That particular early automobile _was actually named and marketed as the_ "Horsey Horseless"!
-   The BigDog mechanical mule.
    -   And now, The WildCat. It has an added effect of being absolutely terrifying.
    -   The successor to the BigDog, the Legged Squad Support System, that was in development for US Armed Forces, is, in essence, a mechanical packhorse, designed to carry equipment and supplies and collect intelligence for soldiers in urban situations or rough terrain. Like BigDog, it was shelved for having an _extremely_ loud motor for a robot pack mule (similar to a leaf blower) as well as being difficult to integrate with Marine squads.
    -   Boston Dynamics has also developed SpotMini, their quietest quadruped yet as its motors sound like someone walking on squeaky floors. About the size of a miniature horse, the SpotMini can easily move around homes and offices and its arm/head is strong enough to open doors and light enough to hold cans. Unfortunately, its battery is limited to a maximum of 90 minutes per charge depending on how often it is used and the type of job.
-   A concept design by Jason Battersby has a real-life version. Called the Nomad, it even gets energy from eating vegetation \[1\].
