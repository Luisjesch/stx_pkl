We all wish she was our mom.

_"\[She is\] a loving wife and mother who would prove to be as skilled at kicking asses as she was at wiping them."_

— **Narrator** introducing Shirley, _Community_, "Pillows and Blankets"

When an Action Girl is confronted with motherhood, she usually has two choices. She could accept the baby and her "fate" to Stay in the Kitchen; or she can keep her Action Girl status by losing her baby through the wonders of a Magical Abortion, a Convenient Miscarriage or simply giving it up for adoption if it gets born.

The Action Mom says bollocks to that and chooses to Take a Third Option as she keeps her role as savior of the day and the world _while raising her children_. She's a real badass mother.

Beware if you ever harm her children, for you will have an Action Girl invoking the Mama Bear at your heels. There is also a chance that said children will grow up to be badasses just like her.

Related to Action Girlfriend, as she may graduate to "Mom" status if she and her boyfriend tie the knot and have kids of their own. Alternatively, a Battle Couple may find themselves acting as parental surrogates, with the female effectively taking on this role. Truth in Television in the case of mothers working in hazardous jobs such as police work.

Often the matriarch of a Badass Family. If she enters this state before the child has even been born, she is a Pregnant Badass.

    Advertising 

-   In 1998 Coca-Cola had a couple animated commercials made for a "Super Mom" character: A seemingly ordinary housewife with two kids, who is secretly an almighty super hero who saves the planet on a regular basis, yet still makes time to be part of her kids' lives.

    Comic Books 

-   _Marvel Universe_:
    
    -   Susan "Sue" Storm-Richards of the _Fantastic Four_ is a mother of two, and still the strongest member of the four. _Do not hurt her children if you know what's good for you._
    -   Jean Grey of the _X-Men_. Oddly enough Jean fits this despite _never_ having actually carried a child. All her offspring are from alternate universes or timelines.
    -   In X-Men (2013), Jubilee becomes one after adopting a baby which she names Shogo.
    -   Jessica Jones. She laid the smackdown on Kang the Conqueror (a guy who's a threat to a team of Avengers) when he threatened to shoot her if things didn't go his way.
    
    -   Shanna the She-Devil is Happily Married to Ka-Zar and they have a son.
    -   Emma Frost has five cloned daughters, the Stepford Cuckoos. She can be protective of them, and she is quite saddened when two of them are dead (even if one of them, Esme, once betrayed and tried to kill her).
    -   Kelsey Leigh, the second Captain Britain, is a single mom of two children.
    -   Mary-Jane Watson in the alternate universe of _The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows_ where she and Peter are still married and have a daughter, Annie. In the final issue, she uses a set of exoskeletal armor to join her family in beating the hell out of Regent. When she does and her daughter asks what her codename is, she replies, "I already have one: Mom!"
        -   In the mini-series, after taking down Regent, Peter uses his technology to make a suit (that mimics his own spider-powers) for Mary Jane, since Annie was increasingly engaging in superheroics and needed someone to keep an eye on her.
    -   In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Magda is revealed as such in the _Ultimate Wolverine_ miniseries. Also Monica Chang, from The Ultimates.
-   _The DCU_:
    -   Hippolyta of the _Wonder Woman_ mythos. Never mind the fact that Diana _is_ an adult... In _Wonder Woman (1987)_ she even took up the mantle of Wonder Woman for a while. Diana herself was also one Pre-Crisis as she and Steve Trevor had a daughter together.
    -   Steve Trevor's own mother was a WASP pilot during WWII.
    -   Lady Shiva is the mother of Cassandra Cain aka Batgirl and has been kicking ass since 1975.
    -   Donna Troy was also a mother before her son died in a car accident.
    -   Alanna Strange definitely fits the trope, seeing as she's apparently capable of fighting her way past the bad guy's guards, sneaking into the room where he's gloating over her captured husband, taking out the guards _there_ with nerve pinches without him noticing, trading insults with him for a few minutes and then knocking him out — all while carrying her daughter in a sling around her neck.
    -   The original _Red Tornado_, although mostly played for laughs. She was a woman disguised as a male hero with no superpowers and was associated with (but not a member of) the Justice Society of America.
    -   _Supergirl_'s foster mother Eliza Danvers in _Supergirl (Rebirth)_ is an agent of the D. E. O. (Department of Extra-normal Operations), a government agency created to deal with and neutralize alien threats. In _Supergirl Rebirth_ #1 a Kryptonian werewolf is attacking one of the D. E. O. bases, and she quickly figures out where he comes from and what kind of ammo they need, before throwing a grenade at him.
    -   The female Dr. Light is the mother of two, and the former leader of a Justice League team.
    -   Talia Al Ghul after giving birth to Damian Wayne is still badass enough to brandish a handgun and wear a sexy catsuit or have Batman tied up against his will.
    -   The Pre-Flashpoint Lois Lane in _DC Rebirth_. Special mention when she put Batman's old Hellbat Armor to protect her son Jon from the Eradicator.
    -   Queen Atlanta, mother of Aquaman, is no slouch but ended up missing for almost his entire childhood. When he finds her again she's an impressive warrior.
    -   Ellen Baker, mother of two kids and married to Animal Man, while not a superhero has elements of this. Like when Mirror Master invaded her home and she kicked him in the crotch and shoved him down a staircase.
    -   Cheshire did not stop being one of the deadliest Professional Killers in the world after giving birth to Lian Harper.
-   Lupe from _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_ is a fierce freedom fighter and mother of two. Sadly her whole family becomes roboticized.
-   Julia Diggers of _Gold Digger_, showing that having three grown-up kids doesn't keep her from still being one of the top fighters of the fantasy world of Jade. In the series the parents getting involved is generally a big warning sign that things either have gotten really serious or are about to be wrapped up very quickly and painfully for the other party.
    -   Now that she's had a daughter of her own, Julia's adopted daughter Brittany Diggers has become a rather fierce example herself.
    -   Julia's own mother, Brunhilda Brigand, is an action mom herself, one of the few fighters who can match Julia. It really runs in the family.
    -   _Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld_: Amy learned all her warrior skills from her mother.
-   _Ms. Tree_, originally with her stepson Michael and later with her own daughter Melodie (following a stint as a Pregnant Badass).
-   In the _Fanhunter_ comic there's Belit. She keeps her badassery even after giving birth to John and Erika.
-   Nero: Madam Pheip and Madam Nero are both quick to grab all kinds of kitchen stuff to hit their opponents K.O., especially when their husbands or children are threatened.
-   From _Paperinik New Adventures_, Rangi Fangus, mother of Angus Fangus. She is the leader of her tribe, plot to foil the plans of a Corrupt Corporate Executive and lead said tribe to fight alien invaders(while wielding two guns).
-   Tara Chace from Greg Rucka's _Queen and Country_ series quits for a little while after she has Tamsin, but she's back and assassinating coup-plotters in Uzbekistan before you know it.
-   Suske en Wiske: Tante Sidonia, despite being Suske and Wiske's aunt rather than mum, can be quite inventive in action scenes if she wants to.
-   Nomi Sunrider of _Tales of the Jedi_ serves as a knight in the Krath and Great Sith Wars. In one ambush, she actually fights with her daughter Vima on her hip, and in fact got started on the Jedi path when defending herself and her daughter from her husband's murderers.

-   The titular Action Girl from _Yoko Tsuno_ becomes this after she adopts a little girl named Morning Dew.
-   This is a theme in _Revival_: hero cop Dana Cypress, ninja assassin Weaver Fannie, and General Louise Cale all have children.
-   Sheriff Clara Bronson of _Copperhead_ is a hardheaded lawbringer raising her preteen son Zeke as a single mom.
-   Zoe Washburne in the _Series/Firefly_ comics. She found out she was pregnant after her husband’s death in The Movie and she continues to be a warrior woman even while raising Emma, and later alongside her in _Firefly: Brand New 'Verse_

However, armed with but her gravity powers and guerrilla-style Mama Bear attitude, she manages to not only beat up tons of Mooks with surprising ease, but also successfully raise and take care of a feisty teenage girl... and eventually, a feisty teenage _pterosaur._

_Pretty Cure_

-   In _Futari Wa Pretty Cure Blue Moon_, Mysterious Watcher Dawn mentions a few times that she has children and can thus relate to the Mentor Mascots' worry about their own son (who happens to be the new Cures' partner).

_Young Justice (2010)_

-   _The Incredibles_ and _Incredibles 2_: Pictured on this page is Helen Parr, a.k.a. Elastigirl, who can still kick butt with the rest of her family despite having more than a decade of hiatus.
    -   Helen herself seems to invoke a kind of this trope in one deleted scene, by blowing her gasket at an Iron Lady who belittled her choice to become a stay at home mom, ranting about how raising children is, when you come down to it, a much more difficult job that is much more important to the survival of humanity than said business lady's swanky executive position ever will be, even when you _don't_ consider that Helen's children will save the world.
-   _Meet the Robinsons_: Franny's main hobby outside of conducting frog bands is practicing her karate skills, demonstrated at the dinner table complete with bad kung fu movie dubbing.

Unfortunately, she actually takes the wrong boy by mistake.
-   _Aliens_: Ellen Ripley. Her relationship with Newt is completely maternal, even though they're not biologically mother and daughter. Much ass-kicking is induced by that relationship. "GET AWAY FROM HER, YOU BITCH!", indeed. The directors cut of the film also reveals that she had a daughter back on Earth before leaving on the trip that sets off the series. Said daughter grew old and died while Ripley was lost in cryogenic sleep for 57 years, making her connection with Newt all the more significant.
-   _The Banana Splits Movie_ has Beth — Harley and Austin’s mother — going through extra lengths to protect her two sons and the other children from the Splits. She manages to throw Bingo off a giant ledge and kills Drooper via impalement in self-defense.

-   The DC Extended Universe has Hippolyta (best seen in _Wonder Woman_ and _Zack Snyder's Justice League_), the Queen of the Amazons and mother of Diana/Wonder Woman. She'll jump in the heat of battle just like the other Amazons, and boy is she a badass at it.

-   _Jane Got a Gun_: Jane is the mother of a young daughter who takes up arms against very dangerous criminals to protect both her husband and her child, trained by gunslinger Dan Frost.
-   _Kenau_: Kenau is mother to two daughters and the leader of a whole band of action girls that really existed: the Women of Harlem.
-   _Kill Bill_: Although she tries and fails to embrace the housewife role, Beatrix could fit this trope, especially since in the end it is implied that even though she is reunited with her daughter, she's probably not going to be able to go forever without kicking ass.
-   The Geena Davis movie _The Long Kiss Goodnight_ plays with this. The woman, who has amnesia, starts off as an ordinary mom, then remembers that she was an assassin and initially decides to abandon her daughter as the girl isn't really 'hers' (the assassin) but that of her alter-ego (the mom), and then eventually goes through a Character Development into an action mom, combining both.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   A brief moment in _Thor_ has Frigga proving that her son's skill comes from both parents. When she sees that the Frost Giants are invading and Odin was under the Odinsleep at the time, she wastes no time grabbing a sword and killing Laufey's lackey with one hit for coming after her husband. This is upped in _Thor: The Dark World_, where she duels the main villain Malekith and defeats him, only to be stabbed in the back by his Dragon.
    -   In _Ant-Man_, Hope's mother Janet van Dyne formed a Battle Couple with her husband, Hank Pym. The last time Hope saw her, she bid her goodbye before going on a mission to abort the launch of a nuke, which ended with her sacrificing herself by going subatomic.
    -   Pepper Potts is a mother by the events of _Avengers: Endgame_. This doesn't stop her from helping her husband and the other Avengers fight against Thanos in the final battle.
-   _Peppermint_: Not initially given to action, but much of the five years between Riley North's family being gunned down and the present is her learning various martial skills, which she uses in her quest for vengeance and justice.
-   _Scream (2022)_ has two examples:
    -   Single mother Judy Hicks, the sheriff of Woodsboro, doesn't hesitate to charge against Ghostface if it means she can save her son. Not that it doesn't do them much good.
    -   Sidney Prescott is revealed to have given birth to two children. She is also at her most badass in this film, having had 25 years of experience anticipating serial killers in every corner. Whereas danger followed her in previous films, here, she actively pursues danger to save the people she loves.
-   _Series 7: The Contenders_: Brooke Smith pushes this trope to its logical extreme in the dark comedy in which unwilling contestants in a reality TV show are forced to hunt down and kill each other. Smith plays Dawn, the heavily pregnant reigning champion, waddling her way between hits.
-   Ingrid Cortez (Carla Gugino) in the _Spy Kids_ movies.
-   _Skyscraper_: Sarah is a former Navy doctor and mother of two children who uses her wits, cheap shots, and anything she can get her hands on to defeat opponents that can easily overpower her. Crosses into Battle Couple territory with her equally tough husband Will. Being played by Neve Campbell and Dwayne Johnson respectively, this is almost a given.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   Subverted with Padmé, who starts out as an ass-kicking politician, then gradually deteriorates into a ball of mush who gives up on life the moment her kids are born, because she only just realized her husband was a jerk.
    -   Played Straight with Leia, Padmé's daughter. She can use blasters, is a force user, and is an active princess, later general. Though she doesn't engage in physical combat much, she is usually the one behind the plan. Leia is not tempted by the dark side even once, not even after her home planet is destroyed, she is physically and psychologically tortured, her adoptive parents are killed, her real parents are killed, her son turns evil, her husband is killed by him, and her brother vanishes. Take notes, Skywalker boys.
-   _Terminator_: Sarah Connor in the movies and _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ television series, a case where she didn't start out as an Action Girl, but definitely became one after she gave birth to John.
-   _Totally Killer_: Pam has spent 35 years training herself and her daughter in martial arts in case the killer comes back while also having guns, knives, pepper spray, and alarms hidden around her house, refusing to let Jamie go to concerts unsupervised, and even keeping a psychic good luck crystal around as a last resort.

-   _Arrow_:
    -   Lyla Michaels continues to work for A.R.G.U.S. despite having baby Sara in season 3 (or baby J.J. from season 5 onwards, thanks to Flashpoint).
    -   Felicity as of season 6, when she adopts Oliver's son, William. Furthermore in season 7 when she has a baby of her own with Oliver.
-   _Chuck_: Chuck's mother. When she reconnects with her family, she is revealed to be a spy like her son, who has been an undercover CIA agent for the last 20 years in Volkoff Industries, trying to take down a deadly, powerful arms dealer, Alexei Volkoff.
    -   Chuck's sister, Ellie, after giving birth to her daughter, Clara. In season 5, she knocks Daniel Shaw out by hitting him over the head with a frying pan.
-   _Doctor Who_ gives us Amy Pond post-pregnancy, and earlier, after a Jackie Tyler went from annoying shrew to woman who kicks Dalek ass.
-   Alice Carter on _Torchwood_. Gwen Cooper also qualifies in _Torchwood: Miracle Day_, having given birth between series.
-   In _The Sarah Jane Adventures_, Sarah Jane Smith becomes one of these, though both her children were adopted.
-   In _Game of Thrones_, Karsi is both a caring mother and a formidable fighter.
-   In _Xena: Warrior Princess_, Xena has a brief foray as this with her baby Eve, before a plan to evade the gods goes awry and separates them.
-   Niki/Jessica from _Heroes_.
    -   Also Daphne in one possible future that appears more and more likely to come to pass. Technically a "Dark Action Mom" as she's working for the bad guys, but it's more out of ignorance than genuine malevolence.
-   Piper Halliwell from _Charmed_, especially since she became the strongest sister after Prue's death.
-   It doesn't happen until very near the end of the miniseries, so she doesn't get much time, but Aeryn Sun wastes none: she gives birth to her child and _moments later_ takes point on the team that intends to get the protagonists back to their ship.
-   _Mahou Sentai Magiranger_: Ozu Miyuki is the transforming superheroine MagiMother. When the bad guys awaken, her five children must join her as Magirangers and fight them. She is defeated by Wolzard at the start of the second episode and spends the bulk of the series presumed dead. her first action upon her return is to stop the Hades God Toad's Divine Punishment and then lead her family in killing him.
-   Since being a mother is mandatory on a soap opera, many female characters eventually become an Action Mom. This was particularly evident on _General Hospital_ during the 1980s, as (former spy turned police commissioner turned private investigator) Anna Devane regularly fought off various villains and enemy spies all the while raising her young daughter Robin.
-   Nikki Wood in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, the mother of Principal Wood, was a Slayer, and is seen in the comics fighting off a vampire while pregnant and deprived of her Slayer powers. She continued to fight the forces of darkness after giving birth to her son, up until her death at the hands of Spike.
-   Sharon "Athena" Agathon on the new _Battlestar Galactica_ continues to be a Raptor (a combination transport ship, electronic warfare vessel, and bomber) pilot after the birth of her daughter Hera, and will go to great lengths to protect her ( good for us, considering that she's the mother of us all).
-   In _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, Dr. Beverly Crusher is a fine-boned, gorgeous strawberry blonde doctor. She _also_ practices Klingon martial arts on a regular basis, thoroughly enjoys starship command, is _good_ at said command, and oh yeah? will hide the ship she is commanding _inside a star_ and then _trigger a solar flare to destroy you_ if you shoot at her. All while parenting a teenager.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_. Captain Janeway is openly referred to as being a "mother to the crew", and certainly gets Sigourney Weaver on the ass of anyone who threatens them. Probably the most overt example is in "Dark Frontier" when the Borg Queen retakes Seven of Nine back into the Collective, resulting in a custody battle fought with phaser rifles. The two-parter even ends with Janeway "tucking Seven into bed" (i.e. plugging her into the regeneration alcove).
-   Jennifer "JJ" Jareau of _Criminal Minds_ continues to work for the BAU after she has her son.
-   Lindsay Messer on _CSI: NY_. Continues to work as a detective while raising a daughter with Danny. Goes all Mama Bear when Shane Casey is holding her daughter with a gun to her head. One shot, one kill.
-   Catherine Willows on _CSI_ probably counts too. She isn't a cop, but still gets her share of actions sequences. And Do NOT mess with Lindsey.
-   _Lucifer_ has Chloe Decker, who works as an LAPD detective while raising her young daughter, Beatrice, mostly by herself (though her ex, Daniel, occasionally lends a hand).
-   In the second season of _Falling Skies_, Dr. Glass specifically delays telling the father of her child that she's pregnant because she wants to go on a particularly dangerous mission with him.
-   We find out in season four of _Supernatural_ that Mary Winchester was one of these until she left the family business in an effort to have a normal life. Not only did it not work it set a chain reaction of events off that are still screwing her children over to this day.
-   Mrs. McCall of _Teen Wolf_ is an interesting example. At first, she was unaware of her son Scott's being a werewolf—but once she became privy not only to that, but all of the supernatural goings-on in her town, she quickly rose to Action Mom status, helping to fight off the various monsters that attack Scott and his friends.
-   Carol from _The Walking Dead (2010)_ is a zombie-killing badass. This trope is subverted when her daughter gets infected, and subsequently gets the shit shot out of her.
-   Teyla in season five of _Stargate Atlantis_ with a dose of Mama Bear (Bye, Michael.
-   In _1000 Ways to Die_, a pervert flashes a group of young moms. Unfortunately for him, the ladies were members of a fighting club named "M.I.L.F" (aka "Mothers I Want to Fight") and, without hesitation, they squirt him with their babies' milk bottles, full of breast milk. The perv grabs one and drinks the contents... too bad that the lady had eaten peanuts (so the milk had some traces of peanut in it) and the pervert had a peanut allergy, which ends up killing him.
-   _Wonder Woman (1975)_: Wonder Woman's mother is Hippolyta (the Amazon who defeated Hercules), but this is never confirmed or denied in the show. However, in "The Feminum Mystique", the Amazons overthrow the Nazis who were holding them prisoner after seizing Paradise Island. The last defining act is when Hippolyta, armed with a feminum bracelet, stares down the leader informing him that his gun is now useless against her.
-   _The White Queen_: Margaret of Anjou's husband Henry VI is imprisoned and suffers from a mental illness, so she takes matters into her own hands by waging a war on the Yorkists to secure her son's inheritance.
-   _The Witcher (2019)_: Queen Calanthe personally leads her armies into battle, then swaggers back into her throne room, armor caked in the blood of her enemies and demanding a drink.
-   _Strange Empire_: Kat. She's easily more badass than most men, especially in defense of her biological or adopted kids.
-   _Big Sky_: Cassie's an Action Girl good with a gun or her fists who's also the mother of a son named Kai.
-   _The Wheel of Time (2021)_: An Aiel woman (Tigraine, the Dragon Reborn's mother), is shown skillfully taking down several armed and armored men using her two spears while _in labor_. She gives birth right after.
-   _In From the Cold_: Anya/Jenny is highly skilled at unarmed combat and using weapons, given she's a trained assassin. Early on, she takes down multiple armed CIA agents with ease before she's overcome, and it only continues to be shown from there. In the present she's also the newly divorced mother of a teenage daughter, Becca.
-   _No Ordinary Family_: Stephanie starts spending a lot more time being there for her teenaged children once her superpowers give her time to get her work done faster, and is quick to travel across the country or fight super-powered criminals.
-   Most of the female cast of _Once Upon a Time_ qualifies, whether as heroes, villains, or switching from one to the other: both Emma and Regina, Henry's mothers (biological and adoptive, respectively), _especially_ when Henry's life is on the line; Snow White, who, cursed persona notwithstanding, doesn't lose an ounce of badassery after giving birth to Emma and then Neal; Granny, who's a tough cookie with a daughter (Anita, another total badass) and granddaughter; the other two Mills women, both evil Cora (Regina and Zelena's mother) and Zelena (once she gives birth ro baby Robin); Milah becomes _a pirate_ after Baelfire is born (though that involves abandoning him); the second iteration of Cinderella is an all-around badass with a child, and even the first version doesn't shy away from picking up a shotgun while having her own kid and also running Stoorybrooke's daycare; Maleficent, the Black Fairy, Gothel and Lady Tremaine are all (more or less) villainous examples, too. It was somewhat inevitable, given the series' focus on strong female characters _and_ family.
-   _The Power (2023)_: Zaia is heavily pregnant when she leads the slave revolt which frees her and the other women. She then leads them when they form into a rebel army, and doesn't let giving birth stop her. The last iconic shot of her in the first season is her holding a rifle in one hand as she simultaneously breastfeeds her baby, smiling joyfully after her forces defeat the Army.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Sweet Saraya is not only the step mother of Zebra Kid (whom Ring of Honor fans may remember as the first challenger to the rechristened World Title), not only the biological mother of Nikki Knight, Zack Zodiac and Britani Knight but in the case of the latter two, she's also been their direct competition.
-   In 1993, La Sirenita had to vacate the Mexican National Women's title due to a pregnancy. In 1994, she regained the belt by defeating rival claimant Maria del Angel. Also, her son would grow up to become the luchador known as Enigma.
-   Jillian Hall was raising a daughter around the same time she was training to be a pro wrestler.
-   La Chacala had two sons by the time she was City Of Monterrey Champion.
-   Madison Eagles remained active after starting a family with fellow wrestler Ryan, having a daughter.
-   Getting pregnant put a halt to her boxing career and taekwondo practioning, but it also opened to door to Black Rose's professional wrestling debut when she was scouted by Rico Suave, who dared her to try it. "It" turned out to be an unsanctioned attack on WWC's then top woman Stacy Colon, but getting bashed by Stacy's brother Eddie while being showed with explicitives from the fans made her hungry for more.
-   In 2008, Allison Danger revealed to Valerie Malone that she would be taking time off to begin raising the next generation of SHIMMER athletes. Unfortunately for her, some aggravation from the current generation saw her return a little earlier than expected.
-   Sienna Duvall has reminisced about looking out into the crowd and finding her own son among the people booing her.

-   Jazz, when thanking Diva Dirt for a Legacy Award, mentioned how much time the job took away from being with her husband and kids.
-   When Kharma gave birth to her first child on December 31, 2011, people did not expect her to be back in the ring for a few more months. So imagine everybody's surprise when she apeared less than one month later as the third woman to ever participate in the Royal Rumble, easily tossing around any male wrestler who tried to confront her. Sadly, it was later revealed that her child did not survive birth.
-   Nevaeh, half of SHIMMER's first champion tag team and enforcer of CZW's Oi4K has made off handed comments about having a daughter. The other half of that team, Ashley Lane, has also made off hand comments about returning to the ring after giving birth.
-   Sin-D continued to wrestle even after her daughter, Amanda Ruffen, debuted.

-   La Amazona had stepped away from the ring after getting pregnant but returned in 2015 to EWO in Puerto Rico after being provoked by arch rival Sweet Nancy.

    Religion 

-   _The Bible_: Catholic military victories tend to get attributed to the intercession of Mary. There's a reason one of her titles is "Our Lady of Victory."
-   Hindu Mythology: Durga, the powerful warrior mother-goddess.

    Roleplaying 

-   Sarah Bishop in _Dino Attack RPG_ fits this role rather nicely. At first she seems a rather gentle woman who just wants her daughter to be safe... that is until she gets a chance to actually go out onto the battlefield.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Spanish fanzine-turned-comic-book-turned-RPG _Fanhunter_ introduced the generic character of the "Ninja Granny" (original: "Ag? ninja"; later concretized in at least one individual), who supposedly learned ninjitsu in some Age Concern course, kicking the players' collective ass and them intending them to eat her "coqrettes" (original "cocretas" instead of "croquetas").
-   The _Weapons Of The Gods_ RPG has the "Xia Pregnancy" martial arts technique that allows a woman to fight at (almost) full strength while pregnant. It also protects the foetus from any attack that does not kill the mother, and, during the third trimester, protects it from attacks that DO kill her.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Fate/stay night_: Saber and Caster. Mordred is actually King Arthur's bastard child in the legends. Caster is actually Medea, who was a mother in the Grecian myths; a crazy ass mother who killed her own children to get revenge for her husband Jason both dumping **and** horribly defiling her in the view of everyone, but a mother nonetheless. She also gives birth to more children later on; probably the most notable is King Medus.
    -   Well, Saber is debatable. Apparently, Mordred was given birth to by Morgan Le Fay, with Arturia just serving as a sperm donor while being under a Gender Bender spell by Merlin.
-   _Umineko: When They Cry_' has 2 examples:
    -   Rosa Ushiromiya, is a Combat Pragmatist that once she is pissed off by threatening her daughter's life or her love for her is questioned, she goes directly into Unstoppable Rage mode and literally becomes a One-Woman Army equipped with a riffle and any Improvised Weapon she gets on her hand.
    -   The sister-in-law of Rosa Kyrie is also this.
-   Plum Kitaki of _Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney_ might count as one. She's the wife of the most powerful mobster in the city, and as such is one of the forces behind the criminal empire they run; she also has a son, Wocky, who she loves dearly. Plum is a big, jolly woman who spends most of her time sweeping the street outside her family's estate...using a broom with an _extremely sharp katana_ hidden in the handle. When the police come to seize the family's weapons, she refuses to part with it. And whenever she shows you the blade, her face goes from broad and smiling to a look that shows she knows how to use that thing to do more than clean. You don't want to mess with her.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_: Huntsmen and Huntresses are men and women who fight the monsters that are overrunning the world and attempting to destroy humanity. Summer Rose was a huntress who went on missions to fight the monsters while simultaneously raising two children, one not even being her biological offspring.
    
    **Yang**: Ruby and I grew up in Patch, an island just off the coast of Vale. Our parents were Huntsmen. Our dad taught at Signal, and our mom would take on missions around the kingdom. Her name was Summer Rose, and she was, like, Super-Mom. Baker of cookies and slayer of giant monsters.

-   A rare example of the Pregnant Badass version appears in a strip of _The Order of the Stick_ strip, when a team of ninjas attempt to assassinate a pregnant mother and on-leave soldier named Kazumi. It doesn't go very well for them. She is a sexy, deadly Von Neumann machine.
    -   Vaarsuvius may or may not be one as well.
    -   Hilgya is a Chaotic Evil example. She adventures and fights while carrying her baby around with her.
-   Jan Jones, AKA _Miss Melee_, is a superhero with a 14-year old daughter. Her crimefighting friend Osakan Riot has two daughters of her own as well.
-   Mitzi McNinja of _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_, who toughens up her sons by either poisoning her beets or challenging her eldest son (whose chosen profession as a medical professional she frowns upon) anytime he comes over to their house. In one story arc, Dr McNinja knows that something is very wrong because he doesn't have to fight his way into the house past her.
-   Cloud's mom Ye Thuza from _Sandra and Woo_ is not only a loving mother and housewife, but also an urban ninja who single handedly nails a tonberry to a concrete wall with a wooden staff. And teaches proper survival skills.
-   _The Fancy Adventures of Jack Cannon_: Jack Cannon was trained by his mother, who has shown herself to be more than competent in combat.
-   The backstory of _Dragon Ball Multiverse_ 's Universe 3 brings us the saiyan Hanasia, aka: Goku's mom.

This includes taking on Dodoria.
-   _El Goonish Shive_: Word of God says this is why Nanase's mother wants her to excel with a 4.0 GPA and be a master level martial artists despite contradiction of also wanting her to be a House Wife. ("Moms have to be intelligent, knowledgeable, and capable of utterly destroying anything that dares to threaten their children.")
-   _Vampire Cheerleaders_: Stephanie and Charlotte both became mothers in the comic's final volume: the _"Adventures in Space... and Time?!"_ arc.
-   The second prologue chapter of _Professor Amazing and the Incredible Golden Fox_ closes with Isla Grace Abernathy, aka the superheroine Golden Fox, giving birth to her and Parker's third child. Fortunately her mother is willing to babysit while she's off fighting crime.

-   Elizabeth Carson, the headmistress of the Super Hero School _Whateley Academy_ in the _Whateley Universe_ is not only an Action Mom, but an Action Grandmom. She's Lady Astarte, the greatest superheroine around.
-   AmberWatch Alert, a group that is obsessed with the possibility of pedophiles in our midst, made a gun porn PSA featuring four ostensible mothers, a metric ton of gun unsafety, and the tagline "You don't have to have a gun to protect your kid, but it helps". One netizen made the obvious connection; four people + gun porn = _Left 4 Dead_ advertisement. The slightly altered video makes both an excellent parody _and_ an excellent _L4D3_ advertisement.
-   Although her daughter is an adult now, Talon from _Less Than Three Comics_ certainly fits this trope.
-   Magda "Spots" Guitart of _Spots the Space Marine_ is a giant-crab-slaying, cookie-baking mom of two. Plus, she talks to aliens.
-   Sabella Hall, sword fighter and Indigo Child, from _Trinton Chronicles_.

-   Genoa Rivas in _Void Domain_ is the mother of one of the main characters. She was once a bounty hunter/mercenary and has countless scars to show for her efforts. None of her badassery has been lost since her more active days.
-   Just about any mother in _Digimon World: Infamy_ qualifies, seeing as they're usually some of the strongest Digimon around and, due to the Digital World being what it is, they can't really afford to sit on their laurels. For specific examples, both Rain and Inari are easily some of the strongest Ultimate-level Digimon seen and still have quite a few kids, Rain especially.
-   Aphmau, the main character of _Minecraft Diaries_ is both a loving mother of four and an _actual goddess_.

    Western Animation 

-   _Dexter's Laboratory_:
    -   Dexter's mom (OK, his whole family) participates in two episodes. Go, Dexter's family, go!
    -   There's also the episode where Dexter gives his mom super powers. However, she uses them less for Action Mom duties and more for domestic chores, like super-speed shopping.
-   Like Helen Parr, Helen Bennett (a.k.a. Mother-1) of the _Bionic Six_ is the mom in a super family.
-   Tara on _The Herculoids_ didn't fight too frequently, but once in a while showed quite the Action Survivor chops:
    -   In "The Beaked People" she shot one of the title creatures with an energy rock
    -   In ''The Android People" she helped to rescue Zandor.
    -   In "The Spider Man (sic)" she led the Herculoids in rescuing Zandor and Dorno.

    -   For that matter, Princess Catherine helped raise the Avalon Clan and is still _very_ protective of her "eggs".

-   Agent K from _The Replacements_.
-   Maddie Fenton from _Danny Phantom_ is a self-proclaimed ninth degree martial artist ghost-destroyer who still manages to make time to bake new cookie recipes.

-   Drew Saturday of _The Secret Saturdays_.
-   Lois Griffin in a episode of _Family Guy_, she was trained in Karate and was manage to fight a whole bar of people.
-   Kim Possible's mother during her A Day in the Limelight episode. Suffice it to say, she did quite a good job filling Ron's boots when he couldn't come.
    -   Kim's Nana who's an Action Grandma.
-   Loopy's mother in _Life With Loopy_ becomes this in the episode "Secret Agent Mom".
-   Dear Lord, Nicole from _The Amazing World of Gumball_ fits this trope like a glove. Just watch the chase scene in the DVD episode.
-   Ms. Wakeman from _My Life as a Teenage Robot_. She doesn’t hesitate to jump into action, and even fought Vexus with her bare hands in the Big Damn Movie.
-   Lana from _The Lionhearts_ is this, as she's a former circus lion and rather skilled on the trapeze.
-   Cheshire from _Young Justice (2010)_, who brings her baby daughter to a rescue mission to the annoyance of her husband.
-   _Avatar_ franchise:
    -   The previous Earth Kingdom Avatar, Kyoshi, is the only Avatar who’s confirmed to have been a mother. She also had a ferocious reputation as a Pragmatic Hero who didn’t follow Aang’s Thou Shall Not Kill rule.
    -   _The Legend of Korra_: Suyin Beifong is a very capable Metalbender like her mother Toph was, and very protective of her children. When her daughter Opal is taken hostage (alongside the rest of the new Air Nation) by Arc Villain Zaheer, she immediately decides to participate in the fight against the villains.
    -   Toph was this as well when she was younger, considering she was the Chief of Police and one of the most powerful Earthbenders ever. In the present time she's a case of Never Mess with Granny.
-   In the three OVA post-season 2 of _Wakfu_, Evangelyne is now the mother of two children and that absolutely don't stop her from going on adventures. She's also seen teaching archery to her son.
    -   Seaon 3 trailer shows her pregnant, which might be an indication for something

-   In _Star Wars Rebels_, Rebel Alliance General Hera Syndulla acts as a mother figure to young heroes Ezra and Sabine and later gives birth to her biological son in the midst of the Galactic Civil War, continuing to serve the Rebellion until the final battle is won.
-   Queen Moon from _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_, first saving Star from angry relatives by entering her Super Mode, then fighting off the Big Bad in the Season 2 finale
-   Keith mother, Krolia, from _Voltron: Legendary Defender_ is 100% one of these. In addition to being a spy for the Blade of Marmora, she is also seen to be extremely capable of fighting with both a sword and a gun.
-   _OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes_ has K.O.'s mom Carol, who's equal parts sweet, doting mother and ass-kicking veteran hero.
-   Celery from _Ready Jet Go!_. Besides being an Ace Pilot, she has super strength as revealed in "A Hammer and a Feather", and is generally the most action-y of the Propulsion family.
-   Kaiko Nekton from _The Deep (2015)_: underwater explorer, ace submarine pilot, and Mama Bear.
-   _Molly of Denali_: Layla Mabray balances being a mother with being a badass bush plane pilot.
-   _The Owl House_: Camila Noceda, Luz's mom, is a very sweet woman who works as a vet and raised Luz on her own after her husband's death. However, she can be absolutely _ruthless_ when you threaten the safety of her children, biological or not. She saved Vee from a crazy conspiracy theorist by knocking him out with her slipper, dove into a lake with zero hesitation to save Hunter from drowning, and traveled to the Boiling Isles to return the Hexsquad to their families, armed with nothing but a baseball bat. "For the Future" shows that, while glyph magic isn't her forte and she's far from the strongest hitter on the team, she definitely packs a punch.

    Real Life 

-   Kerri Walsh Jennings, three-time Olympic gold-medalist in Women's Beach Volleyball, gave birth to two children in between her gold-medal victories in _Beijing 2008_ and _London 2012_.
-   Oksana Aleksandrovna Chusovitina, artistic gymnast and world champion who competed for the Soviet Union, the Unified Team, her native Uzbekistan, Germany, and later for Uzbekistan again — in the second-to-last last case, it was _because_ of her motherhood, as it's in Germany that she and her also sportsman husband found medical aid for their son. She's actually one of the _very_ few gymnasts who have returned to high-level competition after having kids (in fact she competed in her third Olympics _less than a year_ after having her son), which has made her a role model for female gymnasts. Not only that, she has had far and away the longest competitive career of any female gymnast _ever_, competing in _eight_ Olympic Games (she keeps saying she's going to retire, and then not doing it — chances are we'll see her in Paris). To put this in perspective, a significant percentage of the gymnasts at the 2012 Olympics in London hadn't even been _born_ when Chusovitina won her first international medal (and that number will only go up in future Olympics). Bad. _Ass._
    -   Not only is she still competing, she's _remained competitive_ on vault in particular, making vault finals in three consecutive Olympic games and quite a few of the World Championships in between, and winning a world medal on vault as recently as 2011 (a silver) and just barely missing out on a bronze in 2018. In 2016, she attempted the incredibly difficult Produnova vault in the vault finals, which, while she fell on the landing, was probably among the best attempts since Produnova herself<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . And now consider that the vault apparatus has changed significantly since she began competing; she learned to vault on a completely different apparatus, and managed to adapt to the current apparatus well enough to win multiple major international medals on it.
-   Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina gave birth in 2017 and returned to training shortly thereafter, with hopes of making the Tokyo Olympics. She struggled to get into shape in time to be competitive for a spot on the team in 2020, but with the Olympics now being pushed back a year due to the coronavirus, many fans feel she may have a realistic shot to make the Games. Even if she doesn't, though, the fact remains that in 2019 she went to a major FIG-sanctioned all-around invitational in Birmingham and _won_, beating out world-class gymnasts like Riley McCusker of the United States and Ellie Downie of Great Britain — two years after _having a baby_. This girl is _badass_.
-   Forward Jessica McDonald is the only mom on the 2019 US Women’s World Cup champion squad. She’s also one of seven moms in the entire National Women's Soccer League.
-   Sharran Alexander is a morbidly obese single mom of three who took on Sumo Wrestling both to support her family and make it big in the ring so she could further the way for women to be involved in the sport. A Fat and Proud Acrofatic mother who has proudly supported her children and made herself known as the heaviest sportswoman in the world. She is very good at the sport, having won 6 gold medals.
