It's not uncommon to see a lot of wood and steam in a sauna.

_"Back to nature, just human nature  
Getting on back to  
I think I'm done with the sofa  
I think I'm done with the hall  
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby  
Let's go outside (let's go outside)  
In the sunshine  
I know you want to, but you can't say yes  
Let's go outside (let's go outside)  
In the moonshine  
Take me to the places that I love best"_

A male character looks for casual, no-strings-attached same-sex sexual encounters out in public, with the hook-up sometimes happening _in_ public.

This is referred to as cruising in gay slang/code. The term was coined in the '70s, although the practice is Older Than Dirt. While not exclusive to gay/bisexual men as heterosexuals partake in the same behavior, cruising has a history amongst queer men. Homosexuality and homosexual sex being either illegal and/or extremely discouraged by many societies drove men to get together with each other in secret in order to satisfy sexual needs. This happens in gay bars and gay hangouts, but also happens outside of those areas (as in _outdoors_). These areas are known as "cruising grounds" or "cruising spots;" they can be in the woods, or in the park, a public restroom (that specific form of cruising is referred to as "cottaging;" the term originated from the UK), etc.

Narratively, this trope is often used to highlight a character's promiscuity going against all reason or to highlight homophobia and public shaming of men who have sex with men in certain time periods as cruising stings were used to intimidate the LGBT community. The Armoured Closet Gay goes hand in hand with this trope as their feelings of gayngst and shame can drive them to cruising. As a counterpoint, the cruiser can be a sexually liberated character and can level accusations of Slut-Shaming towards those that would condemn him for looking for public fun.

As time marched on and the LGBT Rights movement gained momentum in many countries, cruising is no longer as prevalent as it was, at least in those aforementioned nations. Internet websites and queer male dating apps such as Grindr have mostly supplanted cruising. Not to say it has _completely_ gone away; meet-ups can be arranged via those methods and old habits die hard.

Sub-Trope of Secretly-Gay Activity.

This can lead to Sex in a Shared Room. Related to All Gays are Promiscuous and All Men Are Perverts.

This is not to be confused with gay cruises, such as in the film _Boat Trip_, though cruising happens on those as well.

-   In Rusty's half of the _Soul Sucking Brain Zombies Duology_ (one of the sequels to _Geography Club_), Rusty thinks Kevin (his complicated Love Interest) is cruising in the park when Rusty goes to meet up with him.

When the AIDS epidemic comes in the '80s, many of these characters contract the disease and die. A subplot involves a character becoming a gay rights activist and trying to spread awareness of the dangers of the activity.
-   In _Euphoria_, Cal Jacobs's compulsive cruising habit sets off the events of the first season, as one of his sexual partners happens to be trans girl Jules Vaughn, who happens to go to the same school as Cal's son Nate.

Daniel accepts, and while his goal is to interview Louis, he adds, "I mean, if something happens, you know, I'm cool."

However, his cruising continues until he's an adult and in a committed (but open) relationship; he meets up with guys in the woods and at truck stops. He's forced to examine his behavior after getting bashed in a sauna after he accidentally hits on a straight guy.
-   _Wire in the Blood_: The opening two-parter "The Mermaids Singing" has a serial killer apparently preying on closeted gay men and dumping their bodies in cruising spots.
