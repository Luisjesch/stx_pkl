Sanity level directly correlates to shoe quality.

In old times (especially the Victorian era) a lot of attention was given to a person's visual appearance, including clothes and shoes. Ever since then, lack of footwear has been used to portray characters who are mad or at least quirky and out of touch with reality (additional details may include strange and/or unkempt clothing and disheveled hair).

In modern works, they may be cheerfully eccentric and deliberately flouting social norms, or really unhinged and living in their own world.

Subtrope of Prefers Going Barefoot, and often overlaps with The Ophelia. Compare and contrast with Barefoot Sage whose wisdom and enlightenment also places him/her above social conventions (they may also overlap). May also overlap with Magical Barefooter. The extreme version of the trope, when the character in question is lacking _any_ items of clothing, is Naked Nutter.

    Advertising 

-   A BMW commercial promoting the sensitivity of the car's all-wheel drive follows a businessman who performs various experiments in feeling with his bare feet. While the ad emphasizes the serenity he finds in experiencing new sensations, and becoming closer to his surroundings, his apparent eccentricity in exploring his workplace without shoes does elicit short confused stares from a few onlookers.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Anime and manga feature several Bunny-Ears Lawyer types who are the best at what they do, but go barefoot to indicate that they're Cloud Cuckoolanders. Examples:
    -   Nero from _Black Clover_. While not wacky, her evident trauma has left her a bit off, as seen in her perpetually gloomy and detached nature, and goes barefoot in her human form as a further sign of it. Subverted later, as she adopts simple shoes shortly before joining the Black Bulls.
    -   Ed from _Cowboy Bebop_: a **really** quirky teenage genius Playful Hacker girl with a prominent aversion to shoes and a habit of using her toes like spare fingers. The only time she puts on socks, she quickly loses balance and falls. She doesn't even make it to putting shoes on before she decides to go back to being barefooted.
    -   L, the brilliant but Defective Detective from _Death Note_, only wears shoes while outdoors. Even then, if he assumes his iconic thinking posture, the shoes come off.
    -   Kaolla Su, the Gadgeteer Genius Genki Girl from _Love Hina_.
    -   Papika from _Flip Flappers_, an obnoxiously friendly and childlike space-cadet with an apparent magnetic repulsion to footwear (except for her anklet). She's also Flip Flap's only competent transdimensional adventurer — until Cocona comes along, anyway — and the only one of numerous candidates who could get through to Mimi.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Edolas's Coco Loves is a hyperactive girl who loves running around so much she does all of it barefoot. With the way she runs, any shoes she wore probably wouldn't last a day, anyway.
    -   Mavis Vermillion was subjected to Barefoot Poverty as a little girl, so she got used to being without shoes, and eventually realized she loved being barefoot in lieu of wearing shoes. When she got older and had the option of wearing them, she decided she didn't need to change something that didn't need fixing. It's also a way of exemplifying her strong fairy motif, as many fairies are traditionally depicted barefoot.
-   Mamimi from _FLCL_ is a Broken Bird who became numb to life around her after a painful breakup. As such, she's extremely negligent of the world around her. She also loses her shoes and socks twice in a row while rummaging around in a nearby river, choosing to remain barefoot the second time around.
-   Luffy from _One Piece_ seems inclined to keep his feet as lightly clad as possible. It is very, very rare for him to don anything beyond straw sandals no matter what outfit he wears. Simple shoes for a simpleton.

    Comic Books 

-   When he's portrayed as crazy, the perpetually barefoot Plastic Man would count. His barefootedness dates back long before he was re-characterized as having always been nuts, though.
-   In _Star Wars: Age of Resistance_ Special #1 story "The Bridge", Amilyn Holdo is the only person who goes barefoot onboard the spaceship, while all the other team members are shod; while she behaves in a serious and rational way in this story due to being in a very tough situation, this detail is a reminder of her status as a Cloud Cuckoolander and Bunny-Ears Lawyer.
-   Nate Grey was often a bit odd, but plunged into this territory towards the end of his solo series, in the _Counter X_ era, when he became a 'Shaman' following a Mind Meld with a Crazy Sane alternate counterpart, gaining a strange and rather detached view of the world, seeing himself as its multiversal protector (which also meant he would punish those from Earth-616 who committed crimes against other worlds), and veering straight into Crazy Sane territory (he once responded to a You're Insane! with one word: "Probably"). The barefoot part just cements him (along with his messiah complex and Reality Warper powers) as being rather disturbing.
-   In _The Sandman (1989)_, Delirium, the Anthropomorphic Personification of madness, is always barefoot. This occasionally overlaps with Naked Nutter, when she goes barechested as well, with only an unbuttoned shirt on her torso.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Juliette from _And God Created Woman_ goes barefoot everywhere, including even the shop where she works; it symbolizes her free spirit and disregard for social conventions.
-   In _Art of the Dead_, Louis starts to walk around barefoot and shirtless once he's under the effect of wrath, giving him a more "wild" vibe.
-   Daisy Kensington from _Barefoot_, a Mysterious Waif Womanchild who has No Social Skills because she was raised in isolation by a schizophrenic mother. She evidently spent her life indoors so much she rarely wore shoes and remarks they hurt her feet when she is made to use them.
-   _Barefoot_ is a Foreign Remake of a German movie, _Barfuss_, whose protagonist Lelia also counts.
-   Kady from _Butterfly_ is constantly leaving her shoes off or behind and going everywhere barefoot if she can get away with it because her only pair of shoes is a set of heels and she is in unsuitable terrain for them, and for the most part, she enjoys wearing no shoes. It later morphs into this trope when she willingly walks around in socked feet outside, which is rather oddball and foolish.
-   Luna Lovegood is barefoot in _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_, claiming that all her pairs of shoes were stolen by nargles. It seems highly improbable that someone could have stolen all her shoes without it being noticed by the Hogwarts' staff, so it's possible that she made up the whole story and went barefoot simply because she likes to.

-   Eloise from _The Million Dollar Hotel_: a perpetually barefoot girl who believes herself to be a figment of imagination, and Tom Tom's, the main character's, Love Interest. He later mutters about her having "dirty bare feet", which are highlighted throughout the movie as she goes outdoors and is introduced flinching at drink cup ice falling near her feet. Eloise puts on a pair of heels with a dress for a formal event, but later removes them to run away from police with Tom Tom and places them atop a bar counter in a diner, but ignores them upon leaving, causing a nearby patron to stare at the heels with mild curiosity at her decision to go off barefoot. Tom Tom is Driven to Suicide, it snaps Eloise out of her delirium and she begins wearing sneakers, which she has on at the end of the movie.
-   _Thor: The Dark World:_ After their mother's death Thor finds grief stricken Loki sitting on the floor of his cell barefoot, in torn clothes and with unkempt hair. All furniture is turned upside down and broken into pieces and there are dark smears on the cell's white walls. Once released from the dungeons, Loki switches to his usual appearance and snarky persona.

    Folklore 

-   _Juan Bobo_: Juan is a foolish little boy who is usually depicted barefoot.

    Literature 

-   In _The Age of Madness_, the Judge is a villainous version. She is the unhinged leader of a ruthless revolutionary group known as the Burners. She always wears a red dress with an old breastplate over it, and is perpetually barefoot.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_:
    -   Lucy Pevensie. She is not crazy, but she can be considered somewhat eccentric due to her childlike free-spiritedness (more so as she gets older) — and her penchant for going barefoot emphasizes this. Being barefoot also means she is in touch with the Earth, like healing magic — which her cordial is — is known to be in legends.
    -   _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_ has the wise magician Coriakin who always goes around barefoot. He is also implied to be quite eccentric in Dumbledore-esque fashion: namely, he has a bearded mirror in his mansion (presumably to prank his guests), and he also turned the Duffers (a race of foolish dwarfs he was assigned to govern) into funny one-legged creatures called Monopods as a Prank Punishment for disobedience.
-   Princess Eilonwy from _The Chronicles of Prydain_ is a mild variant of this, having a lot of quirks and a penchant for going barefoot (as pointed out by Dallben in _The Castle of Llyr_; when she _has_ to wear shoes, as in _The Book of Three_, she opts for sandals). She still manages to be one of the smartest characters in the series, an Action Girl, and a Deadpan Snarker.
-   _The Gone-Away World_ has Master Wu, a typical Eccentric Mentor who is mentioned to wear sandals in winter.
-   Auri from _The Kingkiller Chronicle_ is like Luna Lovegood's twin sister, living in her fantasy world and often speaking cryptically. And she's perpetually barefoot.
-   In _Lo que le falta al tiempo_ (_What Time is Missing_) by Angela Becerra, a quirky young Parisian artist Mazarine goes barefoot even in winter.
-   Rain Teslar from _A Path Of Petals_ by M. A. Stacie is a "cheerfully eccentric" version of the trope, and a Manic Pixie Dream Girl for the main character.
-   Assol from _The Scarlet Sails_ is a Cloud Cuckoolander who believes in fairy tales and has a penchant for going barefoot.
-   Hannah Schneider from _Special Topics In Calamity Physics_ is an eccentric and charismatic teacher who has a penchant for going barefoot.
-   _Sword Quest_ from the _Usborne Fantasy Adventure_ series by Andy Dixon has Muddle the Magician, a quirky absent-minded sorcerer who is depicted barefoot in an illustration<small>◊</small>, probably to emphasize his eccentricity.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The Eighth Doctor in the _Doctor Who_ Made-for-TV Movie spends a few scenes barefoot while he's wandering around being amnesiac and weird. It's really just because he hasn't got any shoes after Waking Up at the Morgue, but his barefootedness definitely emphasizes his eccentricity. Grace seems to notice his bare feet as a sign he's a bit of a weirdo, or maybe it's just the toe tag... And then Grace bestows him a pair of shoes, which belong to her newly-minted ex-boyfriend, and Eight goes full Keet over the fact they fit perfectly.
-   River Tam from _Firefly_. She's a Cloudcuckoolander because of her Dark and Troubled Past, and her bare feet get so much attention that they're sometimes called "the 11th character in the show".
-   In _Forever (2014)_ Dr. Henry Morgan is an immortal; whenever he dies, his body vanishes and he reappears naked in the nearest large body of water. Since the series is set in Manhattan, that's usually the East River, and the pilot shows him emerging on Pebble Beach focusing on his large bare feet stepping carefully on the rocky shore. Aside from these times when the rest of him is bare too, in "The Pugilist Break" Henry searches for a cell phone buried under a new playground's rubber surface by taking off his shoes and socks and walking (at times almost dancing) around on the rubber, feeling for the telltale vibrations of the phone when Jo calls it. It does work and Henry successfully locates this key piece of evidence.
-   Danny Rand spends the first few episodes of _Iron Fist (2017)_ wandering New York barefoot. Due to being raised in a hidden monastery, he's eccentric, to say the least. A Running Gag in the pilot episode involves people mistaking Danny for a homeless person and telling him where he can gets some cheap shoes.
-   Gulnar in _Robin of Sherwood_ is a rare villainous example, being a deranged, malevolent pagan shaman who almost always goes barefoot. He does put on shoes when he has to run for his life through a forest, though.

    Music 

-   American mumble rapper Submarine Man is always seen barefoot. He is outspoken against shoes, socks, and especially stockings. And he sings about Smelly Feet in a heavily autotuned voice.
-   The eccentric French singer _Zaz_ (a.k.a. Isabelle Geffroy) frequently performs either barefoot or in open-toed sandals.
-   The music video for Bass Fly and Laurent L's "Tonight" starts with a woman outright abandoning her pumps on the sidewalk (along with a bundle of roses) and barefooting her way through a cityscape because it's liberating, giving new meaning to the term "footloose and fancy-free". Exaggerated when it turns out everyone else is going barefoot, too. Rather yucky because the peoples' feet do get quite filthy tromping through the dingy environment and the actress used for the video obviously has hers cleaned off in between scenes and for close-up shots.
-   Hitomi Yaida, a.k.a. Yaiko, is a little kooky and one of her trademarks is that she loves to be barefoot and hates to be shod. It's extremely common for her to perform in her bare feet and emerge onstage with no footwear at all, treating shoes and socks more like an accessory than part of her normal wardrobe. Her music video "Chain" is even themed after how she would rather just leave her shoes behind and walk everywhere barefoot, stubbornly ignoring the need for shoes _twice_, and in the act of feeling the ground beneath her, she feels unchained (the shoes being the chain) and daydreams herself in a sensual landscape.

    Podcasts 

-   Despite living in Canada, apparently Jessica from _Fat, French and Fabulous_ frequently walks around completely barefoot, no matter the weather. She reports that she still has all nine toes she was born with.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   His pants and mask are the only mandatory public clothing for Delirious. He might show up without anything else, including his shoes. He might show up with footwear, and compulsively remove and put them back on over the course of a match.

    Theatre 

-   In many adaptations of _Hamlet_ (including also movie adaptations) Ophelia is barefoot in her mad scenes.
-   _Orpheus Descending_ by Tennessee Williams has Carol Cutrere, a resident free spirit who walks barefooted.
-   David Tennant's portrayal of the title character in _Richard II_ exists at the three-way intersection of this trope, Barefoot Sage, and Earthy Barefoot Character.
-   In _Ruddigore_, Mad Margaret is costumed and made up as a caricature of theatrical madness in the first act, and this often includes barefootedness.
-   This is how Socrates (the Ur-Example of a Barefoot Sage) is portrayed in _The Clouds_.

    Video Games 

-   _Discworld Noir_ has Malaclypse, the deranged conspiracy-minded priest of the Temple of Small Gods who goes around in sandals, presumably to emphasize his unhinged personality.
-   Most of the elves in the _Dragon Age_ universe avoid wearing shoes, but Merrill, the second game's resident Cloudcuckoolander, is bringing this to the hilarious extremes:
    
    _Your boots go on forever. I'd get so lost in them. I've dropped marbles in. They take an eternity to reach the bottom._
    
-   Dahlia Gillespie and Claudia Wolf from _Silent Hill_; both are really dark examples.
-   The AGS game _The Sleepy Island_ features a crazy barefoot old man who speaks in rhyme and is missing his reflection.
-   In _Torin's Passage_, the old guard Herman wears open-toed sandals; this is obviously by choice and not a part of his guard uniform, since the other guard (Zax, the gatekeeper of Crystal City) has regular shoes. Herman is also more than a little eccentric: he thinks nothing of spending ten years in "heavy traffic" and demands a meal based entirely on puns.
-   Princess Charlotte from _Varicella_ (at least if the game promo art is to believe).
-   Sigma from _Overwatch_ evokes this with his default design, being an insane Gravity Master covered almost entirely in bulky Powered Armor except for his head and toes. He's a benign, polite kind of "insane", but his artists chose not to give him shoes in part because it's symptomatic of his illness, and considering he floats everywhere, it's not a detriment to him.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Batman_'s incarnation of The Joker only ever wears spats that cover the tops of his feet (at most), but no shoes.
-   Zig-Zagged Trope in the _DuckTales (2017)_ episode "The 87 Cent Solution!". One of the events that causes Scrooge's Sanity Slippage is his spats being stolen, but his solution — turning two tissue boxes into a pair of makeshift shoes — is even worse.
-   _Gravity Falls_ has self-proclaimed "local kook" Old Man McGucket, who wears nothing but foot wraps on his feet.
-   Chikara, the kooky fortune teller from _Scooby-Doo! and KISS: Rock and Roll Mystery_, is always barefoot. The KISS group members believe her to also be a Barefoot Sage (she probably is, given that everything she said about KISSteria is eventually revealed to be true).
-   Miracle Grohe from _Sit Down, Shut Up_, a ditzy, New-Agey Hippie Teacher who goes barefoot, is a lighthearted version of this trope.
-   The Drifter, an Eccentric Mentor rabbit man from the _Thunder Cats 2011_ episode "The Duelist and the Drifter", is this trope, a Barefoot Sage and a Barefoot Cartoon Animal all at once.

    Real Life 

-   Socrates was often seen by his contemporaries as this, since in spite of (or maybe because of) his wisdom, he often demonstrated extremely eccentric behavior. One of his peculiarities was a penchant for going barefoot.
-   The Latvian Eccentric Artist Voldemārs Irbe was known for his disheveled appearance and going barefoot all year round.
-   When she was 16, starting from July 2, 2012, Victoria Anderson went on a spirited barefoot crusade by spending an entire _year_ without shoes or footwear of any kind to raise awareness for the needy children of Haiti (noting the only exception to this was carrying around a $2 pair of flip-flops not unlike those worn by Haitian children, just in case she absolutely needed them) and got featured on _The Jeff Probst Show_ for it (the show donated to her cause). Her mother said that her daughter has always been "a little kooky" and she and her father have let her express herself. More telling, though, is that Victoria's motivation for ditching her shoes wasn't just for the children; she also emphatically declared, "I love being barefoot." Essentially, Victoria was also looking for a reasonable excuse to run around barefoot all the time... which she already does.
    
    **Victoria:** I myself have never been very fond of shoes; I'd go days at school barefoot; go to stores and just anywhere with my bare feet.
    
-   Shel Silverstein appears barefoot in several photographs, including the one on the back of _Where the Sidewalk Ends_, which seems in line with the eccentric tone of his writings.
-   In the midst of the search for his missing wife Lori, Mark Hacking was found running around a parking lot, apparently in the throes of a nervous breakdown, completely naked. . ._except_ for a pair of sandals. The fact that he _didn't_ invoke this trope the way a truly insane person would have led the detectives to suspect that he was faking in order to be institutionalized and avoid further questioning about his wife's whereabouts. (Although it was never proven that he was faking insanity, he did indeed confess to killing Lori after several days in the hospital).
-   South African middle-distance runner Zola Budd famously disdained wearing running shoes, arguing she was better off without them. Her career was marked by controversy and she made a controversial appearance in the British Olympic team, which depended on her being able to claim dual British nationality. Her Olympic appearance saw another controversy when she collided with an American competitor, forcing her out of the race.
