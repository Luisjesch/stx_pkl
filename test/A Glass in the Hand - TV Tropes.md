When you're on edge you're gonna squeeze whatever you're holding until it breaks!

_"Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip."_

We've all seen this before. Perchance the character Does Not Know His Own Strength. Maybe he's entering a Heroic BSoD or Villainous Breakdown. Perhaps her Berserk Button has just been pushed or heard something shocking. Whatever the reason, one thing is certain: that glass in their hand doesn't stand a chance.

Next thing you know the character has clenched the glass (or other breakable object) so hard that it shatters in their hand. Depending on the mood, realism of the work and the thing that broke, there may be a cut to a dramatic closeup of blood dripping down from the hand that got cut on the shards. If the character is mad enough they're likely to not notice the bleeding, which might be a good sign that it's time to start running away really, really, fast.

What shatters doesn't have to be a cup; it doesn't even have to be made of glass. It can be a metal can being crushed, or paper being crumpled unconsciously. The important thing in this situation is the distress of the character which caused them to inadvertently crush whatever they were holding. A purposely snapped pencil is a common way to show Suppressed Rage, especially when it becomes personal.

This trope can be used to heighten drama or, in the case that the character breaking the glass is unscathed, played for comedy.

A subtrope of Dramatic Shattering. Truth in Television under certain (painful) circumstances, but usually invokes the Soft Glass effect. Result of Rule of Drama, or possibly Rule of Funny, depending on the mood of the scene. It can serve as an example of Tranquil Fury. Intersects with Knuckle Cracking. Geometric opposite of Dramatic Drop.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Lagoon_:
    -   Roberta does this with a beer mug — holding just the handle — at the Yellow Flag, one of the few hints we get that she's an utter badass before she breaks out the kevlar-lined Parasol of Pain and starts blasting people to hell. It also doesn't hurt her hand because she's wearing gloves or, more likely, because she is that badass. And, as the next episodes show, this is the bottom of what she can go through unscathed.

    -   A much more literal example comes when Gohan and Goku return from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber having learned how to become Super Saiyans in their daily lives — they attempt to have dinner with Chichi but Goku and Gohan can't help smashing glasses in their hands due to their insane strength.
    -   In an early episode Chi-Chi, while washing dishes, becomes frustrated at Goku for being so late (unaware he has actually been killed) and crushes the plate she is holding, then tosses it aside to reveal a garbage bin full of broken dishes and promptly breaks yet another one.

-   VAVA in the _Mega Man X_ manga ends up doing this to a glass of liquid, as a demonstration of how it matters little to him as to what's in the drink to X (he comments that Reploids can't tell the difference between bourbon or mud in a glass). Such was even given a Mythology Gag with his D-Arts action figure, where it shows him with a glass of bourbon and even comes with it.
-   In the _My-HiME_ manga, Haruka does this with a phone receiver when Shizuru informs her that Mai has defeated Nao.

    -   In the special "Mewtwo Returns", Giovanni did this once with a whiskey glass, and later again with a cellphone. The man must have incredible grip strength.
    -   In the _Pokémon Adventures_ manga, Norman is so upset when he finds out his son Ruby ran away from home that he does this with his cell phone. His wife implies he does that quite often.
    -   Similarly, _Pokémon Adventures_' Koga does this to a Golbat-shaped viewing screen/communicator after being defeated by Green.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   In the anime episode covering the unveiling of the Nekoken, Genma does this while lamenting over how his son has suffered by having learnt the technique in question, crushing the glass he was drinking from (bloodlessly) while weeping over how you "just can't save a child from himself". The Hypocritical Humour here, of course, is that Ranma never _wanted_ to learn the Nekoken — _Genma_ was the one who repeatedly wrapped his son in fish and hurled him into a pit of starving cats until the trauma gave him a phobia that could induce a cat-like split personality if he got too frightened.
    -   In both anime and manga, when Akane has "traded" Ranma to Nabiki, she at one point hears what she thinks is Ranma entering Nabiki's room, which is right next door, and does the "listen through a glass against the wall" trick. Between the sounds she hears and her own imagination, the glass promptly shatters violently between her fingers as she sees in her mind's eye Ranma jumping a not-exactly-unwilling Nabiki for sex, whereupon Akane goes storming into Nabiki's room. And gets even more pissed off when she finds out that Nabiki psyched her out; Ranma isn't there and never was there, and Nabiki was just messing with her to get her to pay Nabiki to break up with Ranma.
    -   An occurrence from the last book of the manga: Mousse, Ryōga, the Jusenkyō guide and his daughter Plum are spying on Ranma and Shampoo through a wall, Mousse using the old trick of putting a glass against his ear. When he hears Ranma asking for Shampoo to take off her clothes (a ploy to steal some of the Phoenix people's magical eggs, but Mousse doesn't know this), the glass between Mousse's fingers cracks.
    -   Also, it isn't uncommon for Ryōga to break whatever is in his hands when he gets upset, considering his great strength. For example, at the end of the manga story where female Ranma pretends to be his sister Yoiko, when she finally reveals the trickery Ryōga pulverizes the phone receiver he was holding.
-   In _Rurouni Kenshin_, Makato Shishio crushes a _wakizashi_ with one hand, a momento returned to him by his AWOL The Dragon, symbolic of his relentless belief in Social Darwinism. The animated adaptation goes further and shows whatever remaining fragments in his hand afterwards was held so tightly that it _vaporized_.
-   In _Sailor Moon_, Usagi and Chibiusa are eavesdropping on a disguised Tigers Eye and Fish Eye, who are at the time targeting Makoto. Having danced with her before, Tigers Eye makes an offhand comment about how it's so easy to romance other girls and that he can have as many as he wishes. Usagi is so angered that she crushes a pack of food in her hands, shocking Chibiusa in the process.
-   In _Shaman King_, Tao En seems like a nice guy, right? I mean, he's stroking a panda's head. Then when he gets riled up... Complete with Lampshade Hanging as he tosses the now decapitated panda aside. And yes, the panda felt it coming. And because he has the power to animate "Chinese zombies", the same panda makes an appearance at his lap again a few weeks later.
-   _Shimoneta_: When Anna catches her crush Tanukichi sharing a bed with Kosuri (in reality, Kosuri snuck in), she shatters a carrot in her hand.

-   _UQ Holder!_: Karin has this behavior as a Running Gag whenever her Yandere tendencies for Yukihime start spiking up. It's also perhaps the only real way to tell when she's angry, given that she is well and truly The Stoic.
-   _You're Under Arrest!_: An episode has the cast dealing with an Idol Singer who gets away with committing plenty of parking violations, due to his records being deleted. When Natsumi goes to complain with the Chief, he says that he can't really do anything, so she angrily grabs the cup of tea he's drinking and crushes it in her hand.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Yugi's aura was once so powerful, he broke a glass in Pegasus' hand. _Through a TV screen_.

    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions_: Seto Kaiba rants at his scientists about his desire for a real final match against the Pharaoh and ends his speech by crushing his metal drinking flask and then dramatically tossing it aside. He then concludes with this gem:
        
        **Kaiba:** Fire whoever designed that bottle. KaibaCorp products should not bend that easily!
        

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   The arc "Prey" has Bruce Wayne break a glass when he hears Hugo Strange on a news broadcast perfectly outlining a profile for what might drive a man to become Batman; it's unclear if it's meant to be a Mythology Gag to Strange smashing a wine glass against a wall when Batman foils him in his debut.

    Fan Works

-   Used humorously in _Jaws_, where (big strong tough guy) Quint crushes a beer can, and (bookish weaker guy) Hooper crushes a styrofoam cup in response. Note that in 1975, beer cans were made from tin rather than aluminum, so crushing one actually was an impressive show of strength.

-   The _BattleTech Expanded Universe_ has Justin Allard do this as a threatening gesture at Hanse Davion's wedding—he silently toasts Prince Davion as a Worthy Opponent before taking a drink of wine and then summarily crushing the wineglass in his hand. Notable for doing this with absolute calm when the wedding has just been thrown into chaos by Davion's announcement of the Fourth Succession War during the reception (and a mad grab for dining plates and cake being thrown everywhere). Justified by the fact that Justin has a robotic arm with far more than enough strength in the limb to crush glass (see also the Real Life section below regarding prosthetics).

-   _Lord Peter Wimsey_: In _The Five Red Herrings_, Peter is talking to a witness/suspect while playing with a tube of paint. When the witness innocently says something important to the case, Peter accidentally bursts the tube. The real clue here turns out to be the brand of paint.
-   In _Magic Bleeds_, Kate Daniels is on the phone with a man who tried to seduce her away from her love interest.

When he finally sets it down, it's been compacted into a ball an inch across.

-   _A Bit of Fry and Laurie_ parodies this in one of their "John and Peter" sketches, where the normally hard-drinking mid-level businessmen have been reduced to operating a public restroom and sipping instant coffee out of paper cups. John, as disproportionately passionate about their situation as ever, keeps crushing the empty cups in his hand, leading to the prematurely crushing of one that's still full of very hot coffee.
-   An unusual variation of this occurs in _Black Books_. Bernard, driven crazy by Manny's dad's incessant humming, looks ready to smash his teacup in frustration, but instead takes a _bite_ out of it. Then goes back for seconds.
-   In the _Broad City_ episode "The Last Supper," Abbi shatters a wine glass she's holding, severely cutting up her palm, after she accidentally stabs herself with Ilana's EpiPen.
-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_: The normally timid Charles Boyle has gone full Mama Bear (his words) badass to get his Latvian adopted son Nikolaj a Captain Latvia action figure.

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In "Homecoming", the other Scoobies abandon Buffy to support Cordelia's campaign for Homecoming Queen. Buffy insists to Giles that it's all just fun and nothing serious... and then grips her glass water bottle so hard it shatters. Then again she _does_ have Super-Strength.

-   Happens multiple times on _The Daily Show with Jon Stewart_, as pictured above. The trope was quickly exaggerated, as Jon would first break the glass, then the bottle, then a "comically-convenient fish tank". Then, after an incident in which he cut himself badly enough to require several stitches when he accidentally shattered a margarita glass, he would don protective equipment before picking up the glass to be broken.
-   Happens to the butler in S3E1 of _Downton Abbey_. The aristocrat's youngest daughter has married a commoner with certain opinions about aristocracy that he freely shares at the dinner table. The butler is upset by his comments about the king.
-   _Family Matters:_ A teacher frequently does this with a juice box, a milk carton, and an orange, thus revealing her increasing irritation with Steve Urkel, who keeps interrupting her, then has the unmitigated gall to chastise HER for interrupting him.
-   _Fresh Meat_: Episode 1x4. Josie to Kingsley while he is washing a mug in the sink: "Sex." He doesn't appear to injure himself with his reaction. Or at least he's able to brush it off with a casual "it's fine" easily enough to respond "yes, please!"
-   Spoofed in _Garth Marenghis Darkplace_, when Thornton Reed crushes a paper cup in his hand... despite the fact that the shot immediately before showed him holding a shovel.
-   _The Golden Girls:_ Rose (normally a sweet woman, but also known as a poster child for Beware the Nice Ones), when suspecting her boyfriend Miles is cheating, shatters a _coffee mug_ with one hand.

-   Near the end of the run of the original _Iron Chef_, Chairman Kaga crushes a glass in his hand at the thought of closing his beloved Kitchen Stadium. We later see him holding a glass in his bandaged hand — and, unfortunately, getting anguished enough to crush _that_ glass too.
-   In the _Knight Rider_ episode "Knight of the Juggernaut", Philip Nordstrom breaks a drinking glass in his hand. Justified, in that the hand in question is cybernetic and therefore super-strong.
-   In _Leverage_, this happens when a Victim of the Day starts hitting on Parker's "pretzels". With a _beer bottle._
-   Phil from _Modern Family_ is tasered while holding a mint-condition baseball card. He continues to seize, crushing it more and more while going through a descending list of collectible quality levels from "mint condition" to "trash".

-   _Peep Show_ has a mild example, where a buddhist slams his drink down too hard at a stag night and ends up with a bloody hand. As Super-Hans puts it, "I think maybe Buddha wasn't too pleased".
-   _Red Dwarf_'s "Out of Time" has the Cat say of Rimmer: "You can tell he's tense by the way he scrunches up cups and throws them in the bin, and I'm not talking Styrofoam, I'm talking enamel." Of course, he is a Hard Light hologram.
-   In a 2018 _Saturday Night Live_ episode hosted by Bill Hader, Rex Tillerson (portrayed by John Goodman) does this while discussing being fired by Donald Trump.
    
    **Tillerson:** It's just crazy how, one day, you're the CEO of Exxon — a 50 billion dollar corporation — and the next day... you get fired by a man who used to sell steaks in the mail. _\[shatters glass\]_
    
-   _Smallville_:
    -   When Clark does this to whatever poor object is in his hand, _run_.
    -   Happens exactly so to Oliver Queen. This is, of course, not the first nor the last time in the show's history a character breaks something because they don't know their own strength or how to control it.
    -   Another notable example is glass-breaking girl Maddie who can control glass with her mind.
-   In the sitcom _Sparks_, a judge is talking about a criminal at a party, unaware that said criminal is all spruced-up and standing right next to her. The wine glass he's holding breaks when she calls him "scum".

-   _Twin Peaks_ has the pencil-breaking variety in the first episode. The morning Laura Palmer's dead body is found, a teacher comes in to Laura's secret boyfriend James' homeroom, presumably to tell the homeroom teacher school is out early after the principal's announcement. They then see a girl run screaming across the courtyard through the window. James and Donna both look at Laura's empty desk, and the penny drops. Donna starts crying and James snaps the pencil in his hand in half.
-   _Walker, Texas Ranger_: This happens in the prologue of the episode "Days Past". Vince Pike, a notorious mobster who murdered Walker's old fiancée is let off on a reduced sentence. Walker sees the announcement from the TV in C.D.'s bar and pulverizes his drinking glass, mangling his hand with enough blood to make the shards cling to his flesh. So angry he doesn't even let anyone nurse his wound, he walks out to his Dodge Ram and stamps it with a bloody handprint when lays his damaged palm against the window as he seethes with rage and his eyes burn with a monstrous Death Glare. C.D. even lampshades this:
-   In _WandaVision_ Episode 2 "Don't Touch That Dial", Dottie freaks out and breaks the glass she was holding when she hears Wanda's name repeatedly on a radio, cutting herself and bleeding (red, while everything else is black and white) in the process.
-   _Warehouse 13_ has an episode where an artifact granted Super-Strength The man using it threatened the agents by crushing a cup.
-   In an interesting Cut Himself Shaving twist, in _The West Wing_ Josh's hand is (supposedly) cut up by a broken drink glass in the episode "Noel", when in fact he smashed his hand through a window during a particularly intense reaction to his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

    Video Games

-   _Castlevania_
    -   Dracula in _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_ holds a wine glass in the prologue, which he then violently throws to the floor before he gets up off his throne to fight Richter.
        -   This was later parodied in _I Wanna Be the Guy_.
        -   It gets a Continuity Nod in _Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow_. When the possessed Soma shows up in the Bad End, he does the same pose and throws the glass before fighting Julius.
        -   Same in _Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow_, when you fight Soma in Julius Mode.
    -   Elsewhere, in _Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin_, Brauner gets angry enough before his boss fight that he presses his cane into the ground until it snaps.
-   In this trailer for _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_, Adam pours himself a glass of whiskey and, presumably due to not being used to his mechanically augmented arms, cracks the glass when he holds it. It's a minor example, since the glass doesn't actually shatter, but it still counts.
-   Grodd in _Injustice 2_ combines this with Skull Cups in his intros, first drinking from a human skull and then crushing it in one hand.
-   In an early cut scene in _Max Payne 3_, Max does this whilst getting absolutely blotto in his new Sao Paulo apartment.
-   In _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_, Travis breaks an (empty) glass as he tells Sylvia that he wants revenge on the people who killed Bishop.
-   In one of the plot summaries for _Private Eye_ for the Atari 2600, the plot summary of one of the cases mentions protagonist Pierre Touche doing this.

-   In _Yakuza: Dead Souls_, Kazuma cracks the phone in his hand when he learns Haruka was kidnapped.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_
    -   According to Gumshoe in case 3 of _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_, Edgeworth did this as a result of Phoenix's work in court the previous day... it was a paper cup, but it was filled with hot coffee, so he still hurt himself doing it.
    -   When you break through Dee Vazquez's alibis, she crushes her pipette between her fingers.
    -   Diego Armando does it to his cup of coffee at the end of the fourth case of _Trials and Tribulations_, after the defendant commits suicide before he can testify against his girlfriend. This instance also leaves out the Soft Glass (soft ceramic?) effect, as his hand bleeds profusely after breaking the mug, but he doesn't even flinch as he delivers one of the most iconic lines of the series. For added effect, this trope is the only outward sign of the fury he has to be feeling at that point.
    -   Barok van Zieks in _The Great Ace Attorney_ does this often with his wine chalice.

    Web Animation 

-   _Duke Nukem ForeverQuest_ does a parody of _Streets of Rage 3_, where the mysterious figure watching the monitor doesn't quite get his glass to smash.

-   Happened on _Boy Meets Boy_. Mik being stronger than he thinks plus distraction = broken glass.
-   _Daisy Owl_: Mr. Owl does it with a note from Steve saying that the moon school called to tell him they'd kidnapped Daisy and Cooper. He resolves to go save them and... Justice.
-   Zintiel does this in _Flaky Pastry_.
    
    **Alt Text:** Hey, what did that orange ever do to you?!
    
-   Gear Girl does this with a beer bottle after a blonde bitch splashes Gear Boy's drink right in his face.
-   _Grrl Power_:
    -   Maxima is usually _very_ in control of her Super-Strength, but the adolescent-level antics of her subordinates can sometimes upset her enough that she'd crush her cellphone.
        
        **General Faulk:** Do not break another phone, Colonel.
        
    -   She also breaks a chunk of her pulpit after the succubus lust aura incident, when Mr. Amoprhous suggests that Heatwave ought to experiment it too — but he doesn't mean it in a bad way.
-   Poor Equius, one of the trolls in _Homestuck_, suffers from the Does Not Know His Own Strength version of this every time he tries to have a glass of milk... or a glass of anything, really.
-   Sniper Wolf does it with a glass of water in _The Last Days of Foxhound_.
-   The Tasting Judge, Harvey, from _Nectar of the Gods_ does this effortlessly and constantly throughout the Tournament Arc. It's not for dramatic effect or because he's angry, it's just an easier way to quickly judge through dozens of drinks without verbally announcing the loser.
-   Sandra crushes a soda can in _Sandra and Woo_ when Larisa accidentally sent a nude pic to 60 million people.
-   Happens with Pip and a beer bottle in _Sequential Art_. Apparently, including _Crystal Skull_ as part of the _Indiana Jones_ movies displeases him.
-   _Shortpacked!_: A frustrated Galasso demands something to crush. Mike gives him a glass. We never see the results, but it probably wasn't pretty, given the frantic cry for paper towels and a first aid kit in the very next panel.
-   _Tower of God_: Yeon Ehwa, 19 years old, trying to adjust to cohabitating with her new team mates.
-   Forget a glass. Shelly of _Wapsi Square_ crushes a stainless steel frothing cup when Tina makes her angry.

-   Whenever something needs juicing, squeezing or mashing on _Regular Ordinary Swedish Meal Time_, it stands a fair chance of getting crushed to death in one hand.

    Western Animation 

-   Malory on _Archer_ does this on more than one occasion. As a Lady Drunk who almost always has a glass of liquor in her hand, she is prone to crushing them whenever somebody, usually Sterling, angers her.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_:
    -   In "Joker's Wild", the Joker is dealing at one of the casino tables as if he's a costumed employee. After being trolled by Bruce (to distract him while Bruce gets a good look and confirms that he's the real Joker), he crushes the chip Bruce tossed him as a tip.
    -   In "Joker's Millions", Batgirl suggests that Joker might give up crime now that he's rich. Batman snaps a gadget he's working on in half.
    -   In "The Mechanic", Penguin winds up in prison polishing license plates. When he see that the next one in the pile reads "1BAT4U", he angrily snaps it in two.
-   Used in an episode of _Code Lyoko_. Yumi is in the middle of threatening Sissi when her cup (made of plastic or something otherwise hard to break, but not glass) shatters. Yumi's hand is mildly cut (but no blood) and Sissi wisely backs down. Somewhat subverted in that Yumi _wasn't_ actually responsible for breaking the cup; XANA has been testing sonic vibrations to eventually knock down the school. Yumi is as surprised as Sissi when the cup-breaking occurs. This ends up being lampshaded by Ulrich when he's helping Yumi patch herself up and she throws out the idea of the glasses being fragile, pointing out "We're talking about cafeteria plastic, not Venetian crystal."
-   In _Doug_, when former mayor, Bob White, is introduced as the new principal to Doug's middle school, it's brought up how he had lost his reelection campaign to Mrs. Dink, causing him to snap the ballpoint pen in his hand.

-   On _Phineas and Ferb_, Isabella snaps a pencil in "Summer Belongs to You" when Phineas talks about failed romantic encounters in Paris, oblivious to the fact that she wanted one with him.
-   Spoofed in _The Simpsons_, where Mr. Burns is incapable of crushing a paper cup without Smithers' aid.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: SpongeBob does this in "Can You Spare a Dime?", when he starts getting sick of Squidward's demands and laziness. Being a cartoon sponge, the broken glass is never touched on after it happens.

    Real Life 

-   During the making of Genesis' epic _The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway_, band member Steve Hackett was reportedly so tense that he succeeded in this, severing a tendon in his thumb in the process.
-   One of the challenges in designing prosthetic hands and grippers is avoiding this trope. It's funny when your manipulator's force feedback sensors fail and you squish a glass. It would be less funny if you were shaking someone's hand at the time. Or the shards from the glass fly at your face or drop in your lap.
-   Benito Mussolini employed this trope when he was haranguing his lackeys and REALLY wanted to make a point stick in their minds. Didn't work so well the last time, when they laughed him out of parliament with a bloody, painful hand.
