A very unexpected Reveal for a Scooby-Doo mystery.

So, finally we have arrived to the climactic moment in the story: the main character is fighting the villain, the Love Interest is struggling to free herself from chains, and our hero's friends are coming to his aid... And then comes the Wham Shot. Both the "villain" and the Love Interest smile and cheer the protagonist, then a whole bunch of friends and seemingly "unrelated" characters enter and join them. Congratulations, the whole plot was an elaborate set-up, and everyone (except the protagonist) was in on it.

There may be varying reasons for this: sometimes it's done just for fun and teasing (for example, as a convoluted April Fool's joke or a pretext to a Surprise Party), or it may be the Love Interest's way of flirting with the main character. At other times, there are more serious purposes (like helping the protagonist deal with psychological issues or teaching him a lesson if he's giving himself airs); however, this doesn't prevent everyone else from having fun while doing it. In some instances, it can also overlap with Secret Test.

When a plot becomes overly complex and mind-bending for the media's format, for instance, when you have Conspiracy Kitchen Sink, supernatural events, and life-altering revelations in a comedy show episode, expect this trope to come into play soon.

In order to qualify for this trope, the staging has to be benign and created by the protagonist's **true** friends and loved ones. When a hero does this to trick the villain or vice versa, it instead qualifies as some sort of Gambit. Kidnapped by an Ally can overlap but is usually more serious in intent.

A Sub-Trope of The Ending Changes Everything. A Super-Trope to April Fools' Plot, Surprise Party and Scary Surprise Party. A Sister Trope to and often overlaps with False Crucible and Fake Mystery. May also overlap with Not-So-Forgotten Birthday and Mockspiracy. See also We Would Have Told You, But....

## This is usually an Ending Trope, so _beware of unmarked spoilers!_

    Anime & Manga 

-   The "Conan Edogawa Kidnapping Case" episode of _Case Closed_ has Fumiyo Edogawa, a woman claiming to be Conan's mother (Conan cannot have a mother, since that's Shinichi's fake identity) and attempting to kidnap him. However, she is eventually revealed as his real mother Yukiko, trying to fabricate a situation that would convince him to give up detective work and live with his parents in America. Being a loving mother but at the same time a very childlike person, as well as a top-class actress, Yukiko is almost a living embodiment of this trope: she adopts numerous aliases and hides her true identity from Conan in a number of other episodes, even when there's no real need to do so.

    Comic Books 

-   A _Justice League Unlimited_ issue plays with this. After some shape-shifting Durlans attack, the Question thinks it's part of a bigger plot. He's soon sent on a wild chase involving a trip to Scotland, a monster, a treasure hunt and more. On the station, the main members of the League are telling the rest how the Durlans' empty ship is being sent into the sun when the Question enters. The Founders explain they were worried about him being overwhelmed and so cooked up this wild goose chase. To their shock, the Question replies he knew all along as he noted the DNA of these "strangers" and saw through their tricks. He pulls out a gun to blast down Superman before saying that the whole thing was A) sloppy (which Batman alone would _never_ be) and B) completely out of character as the League always trusts each other. He tells the other heroes how he got onto that "abandoned" Durlan ship to find it was occupied after all. Cue the _real_ Founders bursting in to deal with the Durlan imposters as the Question just brushes off how he saved the day.

Finally, it is revealed that even his brother's death was staged.

Then the ending reveals that the whole battle the young men find themselves in—explosions, artillery bombardments, infantry attacks, civilians getting executed, soldiers getting their legs blown off—was all fake, an elaborate charade arranged by the birthday boy's grandfather, who wanted to give him a _really_ memorable party.

He confronts Sherlock on setting this whole thing up and is so pleased he saw through Holmes' game that he's getting back to work for the Irish police. As soon as he's gone, Sherlock tells Watson he has _no_ idea what Lestrade was talking about, those were actually legitimate muggings that he honestly solved and the feather must have fallen from his own coat.

    Video Games 

-   The comedy ending of _the white chamber_ invokes this.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_: In one episode, Finn ends up having to resolve a Thriller on the Express on the way to his birthday present.

-   Some episodes of _Magic School Bus_ have Mrs. Frizzle play jokes on kids and deliberately mislead them, so that they would learn some new things on their own.

    -   In "Cold Feet", this was partly unintentional: she _wanted_ to tell the class what really happened to Liz, but seeing their reactions, she decided it would be better if she played along and let them learn on their own.
-   The _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "The Mysterious Mare Do Well", the mysterious rival who'd been dogging and showing up Rainbow Dash all episode turns out to be... all of her friends, who'd been trying to snap her out of her Acquired Situational Narcissism.

As soon as they're gone, Superman absently tosses the "Kryptonite" in his hands, revealing it's just a regular rock painted green, the robot was just an old training bot and the whole attack staged to help the kid overcome his fear.
