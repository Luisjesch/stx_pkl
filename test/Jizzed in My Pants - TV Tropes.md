... that and do a load of laundry.

_"I jizz right in my pants every time you're next to me_  
_And when we're holdin' hands, it's like havin' sex to me_  
_You say I'm premature, I just call it ecstasy_  
_I wear a rubber at all times, it's a necessity"_

Bob, being the loser virgin or horndog he is, is... easily overstimulated— so much so that he ejaculates in his pants without even having sex, or in extreme cases, just from Alice talking to or brushing up against him. If he's in public, expect Hilarity to Ensue. If he's in private, expect Alice to be either extremely disappointed in Bob or proud of herself, depending on whether or not it was her intention.

In anime, a similar situation usually causes an explosive Nosebleed. Compare to Raging Stiffie. Contrast with The Loins Sleep Tonight. The end result of a Nocturnal Emission. Can be the cause of some of the Embarrassing Damp Sheets. A man ejaculating too quickly while making love is Speed Sex. Often combined with The Grunting Orgasm. If he peed his pants instead, that is a Potty Failure.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _KissxSis_: Ms. Yuuzuki and her student, Keita, wound up making out in one of the storerooms, during the school's Culture Festival. She got so aroused, that she abruptly broke the kiss to run to the Women's Room; thinking she had urinated. It wasn't until she removed her panties to clean herself that she noticed the smell was different, which is when she realized Keita had made her squirt.
-   _Maken-ki!_:
    -   Chapter 32 begins with a veiled shot of Ouken Yamato screwing one of his concubines hard enough to make the statue outside his bedchamber topple over. The following page shows he had actually shagged several of them, who are seen passed out on the floor around him, while the one from the previous page is seen collapsed in her bed. Ouken's secretary, Miyabi, was so awestruck by his display of virility that it left her dripping.
    -   It happens to the unnamed waitress in the 70.5 omake chapter, after she accidentally drops her serving tray and spills tea on herself. When Espada sucks some of it of the waitress' fingers, it causes her to have an orgasm while still in uniform.
    -   And in chapter 79, Espada has one while wearing her school uniform. She takes a direct attack from Azuki's newly evolved Maken, that was strong enough to draw blood from her. Espada becomes so aroused by it, that she smiles with a full faced blush and squirts; complete with sound effect hiragana and a ♥.
-   _Master of Mosquiton_: Near the end of the second episode, Mosquiton bites Inaho to empower himself to face the pyramid guardian. The bite causes Inaho to blush deeply and go weak-kneed, as she orgasms quite visibly (complete with a close-up as it soaked her shorts, til it trickled down her inner thigh). After which, Mosquiton casts her aside and demolishes the pyramid guardian.
-   _No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!_ has this happen to Kotomi after Tomoki, the boy she's crushing furiously on, promises to give her something in return for her Valentine's Day chocolate. It gets a very strong reaction out of her; so strong, that after looking red in the face for a while, she turns to her friend and begs for a tampon supposedly because her "period just started."
-   After Ainz's first proper face-to-face with the Floor Guardians in _Overlord (2012)_, everyone notices Shalltear's been very quiet and, when asked, explains that Ainz's presence caused her "underwear to undergo a crisis".

-   Scam in _Rainbow_ walks past a whorehouse, sees one of the girls standing in front of it, and declares his intention to "become a man." But her room is on the second floor, and she goes up the stairs in front of him, wearing a very short skirt that provides occasional glimpses of her rear...
-   Occurs constantly with Takara in _Rising × Rydeen_. Takara is a stranger, a superpowered human, and his power is that he can release a slippery white gel from anywhere on his body.

The end result is both him and the girl covered in suggestive white gel.
-   _Shimoneta_:
    -   In chapter 10, Tanukichi mistakes Oboro for a member of Gathered Fabric and wrestles her to the floor. But his foot ends up pressed directly between her legs, which is when he realizes something is 'off', so he to double-checks to be sure. It confirms his suspicion, but also inadvertently causes Oboro to get off from it.
    -   Midway into the anime's first episode, Ayame causes the entire auditorium at school to jizz themselves by doing an ecchi voice-over to a clip of two flies mating. The students go weak-kneed and collapse admist a montage sequence of geyers and volcanoes erupting, and rockets lifting off.
    -   Anna does it with such regularity, that she quickly gained meme status. In episode 5, she becomes so ecstatic from watching Tanukichi eat the cookies she made for him, that she soaks her skirt while gleefully telling him she mixed her "Love Nectar" in the dough!
-   In _Vandread_, one episode ends with Hibiki looking rather... drained while Dita is bouncing up and down, excited after winning a battle (their combined mecha essentially having her sitting in Hibiki's lap). The next episode has Hibiki going to the bathroom, but because Dita is stalking him, he complains that "even the stuff that normally comes out won't come out."

In this case there's nothing premature about it, the character is just dry-humping a woman to completion as a way to get around the fact that he doesn't want to have premarital sex. Considering that he's well known for his collaborations with the group who are the Trope Namers, this could also count as Actor Allusion.
-   In _Blankman_, the title character has so little interaction with the opposite sex that a "thank you" kiss gets this reaction.
-   Poor Milos in _Closely Watched Trains_ suffers terribly because it happens to him all the time when he tries to have sex with his girlfriend Masa, and he considers sex to be a rite of passage.

All this stimulation causes him to jizz all over the shower. Of course, weird as this whole scene is for everyone involved it does result in one of the movie's best funny moments when she replies with: "You're cleaning that up."
-   The Sven Hassel movie _The Misfit Brigade_ (aka _Wheels of Terror_) the Soviets in the trenches opposite put up a large screen and project a ridiculous propaganda movie showing the German soldiers that if they surrender they'll be lavished with wine, woman and song. On seeing a beautiful naked woman inviting them to come over, one of the soldiers jokes that he already has.

        **Rachel**: Oh, God! _\[They roll to their sides, and Rachel tenderly caresses Ross's face\]_ Oh... honey... oh, that's okay.  
        **Ross**: What? Oh, no, you just rolled over the juice box.

    **Phase**: At any rate, I had to concentrate on blocking that aura. She really wasn’t being that discriminating, because the guys at the table behind me were beginning to drool and babble. Okay, it was worse than that. I think two of the guys actually popped their corks. In the middle of the cafeteria. Yuck.
