_"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!"_

Someone is driving along the road, when a passenger mentions/does something that shocks or angers the driver, so the driver slams on the brakes. May be followed up with a "Get Out!".

Often these are Magic Brakes, because even though there is a clear screech, the car still stops faster than it would. But usually this is Played for Laughs, so it doesn't matter.

People do this in real life, but please Do Not Attempt in Real Life, as it may cause the car behind you to rear-end your vehicle, or on a motorcycle, where suddenly slamming on the brakes for 100 percent braking power _will_ flip the bike.

Compare Stopped Dead in Their Tracks as the less violent stunned stop reaction. Contrast Screeching Stop, the use of old car brakes effect when a cartoon character suddenly stops.

    **Garrus**: Get out.  
    **Jensen**: ...We're still in the air.  
    **Garrus**: The LEDA TWINS, who keep toying with the emotions of every lonely officer in C-Sec, practically offer themselves on platter for you, and you say no?  
    **Jensen**: Well-  
    **Garrus**: THE BISEXUAL, INCESTUOUS POLICE BLUE SPACE BABES WITH BIG HIPS BARGE IN YOUR SHOWER BEGGING YOU EMBRACE ETERNITY, AND YOU SAY NO?!  
    **Jensen**: ...Now that you put it that way, that does sound kinda dumb, but-

    Films — Animated 

-   _Eight Crazy Nights_: Whitey furiously stops his car when Davey reveals that he (Davey) stole peanut brittle from the mall.

    **Whitey:** That's it! I'm callin' the judge!
    
-   Goofy does this in _A Goofy Movie_ the day after he finds out that Max had changed the road map.
-   A variation in _Shrek 2_. The Fairy Godmother yelling "STOP THE CAR!" at her chauffeur, while in the middle of a heated argument with King Harold, has the same effect. It's then subverted when she winds down the window to reveal they've merely stopped at a drive-thru.
    
    **Server:** Well, hi there, welcome to Friar's Fat Boy, may I take your order?
    
    **Fairy Godmother:** _(to Harold)_ My diet is ruined! I hope you're happy.
    
-   Subverted in _Wreck-It Ralph_. In the scene between Calhoun and Felix as they fly the spaceship across Sugar Rush, Felix accidentally pushes Calhoun's Trauma Button when he calls her "one dynamite gal", causing her to flashback at the death of her fiancé. She doesn't actually _brake_ the ship (she only flies it to a nearby road to drop Felix off), but the effect is in place.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_: Gillian does this when Spock reveals he knows that Gracie, a humpback whale, is pregnant.
-   _Hudson Hawk_: While Eddie is being driven to the bar after being let out of prison, he tells Tommy Five-Tone about Gates' attempt to blackmail him into doing a job. Tommy angrily slams on the brakes, spilling Eddie's cappuccino.
-   _D.E.B.S._: While Lucy Diamond and Scud are driving away from the restaurant after the gunfight, Lucy tells Scud that she "met somebody" and he brakes the car to a halt in surprise. On YouTube at 2:30.
-   _Speed Racer_, Racer X does this shortly after rescuing Taejo Togokan from Cruncher Block's truck, prompted by this exchange.
    
    **X:** I need your help to bring them to justice.  
    **Taejo:** Justice? That is not a commodity I waste money on.  
    **X:** (_brakes angrily_) ...Get out.
    
-   _Alien Nation_: Newcomer detective Samuel Francisco asks bigoted Detective Matthew Sykes why he'd would want him as his partner. Skyes slams on the brakes and, while other drivers shout insults to him and his embarrassed partner, spells out the obvious fact that "slags" murdered his last partner, so he might actually be of some use finding out who killed him.
-   A variation in _Joy Ride_: When Lewis' younger brother Fuller starts making snide comments about his relationship with Venna, his girlfriend, Lewis veers the car off the road and into the dirt, and tells Fuller to keep his mouth shut.
-   In _National Lampoon's Vacation_, right after Aunt Edna dies, contributing to the long list of things that already went wrong for the Griswolds. Clark does this, while clinging to a string of sanity and tells off his family when they suggest giving up and going back home.
-   In _Hellfighters_, Tish has come from a fire in Venezuela to Houston to ask her father to come out to an oil well fire, only to do this while driving from the airport when her mother tells her Jack Lomax has already asked him.
-   In _Kopps_, after Jessica told the police officers that the station will be closed, Jacob, who dives around with Lasse, suddenly slams on the brakes, gets out of the car and kicks against a trash can out of frustration. Later, Benny finds the damaged trash can and skid marks from the full braking together with Agneta and starts investigating, thinking it's a "crime scene".
-   In _Transformers (2007)_, it's the car itself that does this. When Mikaela wonders aloud why a super-advanced alien robot would turn into a "piece of crap Camaro", Bumblebee hits the brakes and ejects both her and Sam...so he can scan a much cooler car for an alt-mode.
-   _Without a Clue_ has a different take on the trope. Michael Caine's character (playing Sherlock Holmes) is traveling by train when he's informed that Moriarty is involved in the latest case. Cue him tugging on the alarm cord to bring the train to a halt, then cutting to him shouting at Watson in the middle of a field while everyone else has to stand around and wait for the famous detective to get back on board.
-   In _Back to the Future_, Marty does this after the first time travel. As he drives home on the familiar road, then suddenly realizes that the district he is living in is under construction, then hits the brake at full power.
-   _Cosmic Sin_ does this for an Oh, Crap! instead of anger when someone calls up General Eron Ryle as he's driving home. The general is trying to foist the job off to someone else when he's informed that someone has made First Contact with an alien race, causing him to slam on the brakes. The use of this trope is probably why he's not driving one of the Flying Cars we see in the distance.

    Literature

-   In _Generation Kill_, Wright explained that Humvee driver Person was unable to argue with team leader Colbert's orders directly, and so resorted to erratic driving, including braking angrily. This hilarious tendency doesn't show up in the HBO adaptation, unfortunately.
-   _Being Bindy_: During one of their trips, Mum casually tells Bindy that Grandma has been dead for years. Shocked that Mum would go so long without telling her something so important, Bindy asks why they can't really talk to each other, instead of flitting along the surface without touching on major aspects of Mum's life. Mum slams on the brakes, swerves into the shoulder, and angrily tells her that because Bindy isn't a young child anymore she expects to have some privacy, she won't put up with Bindy's disrespect anymore, and if Bindy acts up anymore she'll cancel the trip and take her back to her father's. Bindy shouts, "Then take me back, because I don't want to go with you anyway!" Mum drives her back to her father's house at way over the speed limit.
-   In the "Tubette" story from _Timothy's Tales of Hilltop School_, when the other kids make fun of Doris for being so big, Gus the bus driver pulls over by the side of the road and says to them, "We're staying right here in the dandelions till the teasing stops!".

Where are we?!" to demonstrate the importance of a cop always knowing their location. Lucy is unable to answer, and he forces her to get out and follow as he drives slowly away, until she can tell him where they are. He fails to rattle Jackson with the trick, however.
-   Combined with Pedal-to-the-Metal Shot: once the Carrangers/Turbo Rangers locked their car mechs together to form the RV Robo/Turbo Megazord, they'd slam on their brakes, tipping them up via sheer momentum. Damn cool way to get the robot ready— no random flight or jet engines, just let gravity do the work.

    Theatre 

-   In _On the Town_, during the taxi number "Come Up To My Place", Hildy slams on the brakes harder every time Chip insists on seeing an attraction from his outdated New York City guidebook.

    **Hildy:** It ain't there anymore...
