**Mercenary:** What, you gonna kill me with a tranq gun?  
**Quinn:** You took my kid, so yeah.

Paternal instinct can transform a Bumbling Dad into an Action Dad. If someone threatens his kids they will soon wish they'd never come within a mile of them. This is because fathers are expected to take care of their family and this naturally extends to keeping them safe. Such occasions serve as a way for a father to prove his worthiness—see A Real Man Is a Killer. Expect his children to have a newfound respect for their father and for them to brag that My Dad Can Beat Up Your Dad. If their relationship was previously strained expect it to improve.

Often Papa Wolf incidents serve as a way to reveal that a Non-Action Guy is really a Retired Badass or a Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass (or even a Retired Monster). In contrast to a Boyfriend-Blocking Dad (who sometimes _thinks_ he's this; there is no overlap between them), a Papa Wolf is always portrayed heroically because the latter is defending their kids from genuine threats instead of imagined ones.

A Team Dad may display a streak of this, but the Papa is more likely to be related to his children by blood or through formal adoption, and the children tend to be younger, which may be part of why the Papa Wolf is more oriented toward protecting them rather than training them to defend themselves. However even completely grown children can summon this response in the face of crisis because they are _still_ his children no matter how old or strong they get.

This is the Spear Counterpart to Mama Bear. When Mama Bear and Papa Wolf _team up_, no force on earth can stop them.

Subtrope of Beware the Nice Ones. See also A Father to His Men and Family Man. Combining this with Disproportionate Retribution can lead to a Knight Templar Parent. If the guy is a teacher instead, he's a Badass Teacher. If the guy doing this is a sibling/cousin, you get Big Brother Instinct. Inversely, see Parents in Distress for the kids rescuing the dad. Evil characters can use this too; after all, Even Evil Has Loved Ones. A subtrope of the Papa Wolf is the Badass and Child Duo, where an adult male badass takes it upon himself to protect an orphaned, unrelated young child. See also Cub Cues Protective Parent for examples from the animal kingdom, which might include a _literal_ wolf.

Remember when adding examples that this is Always Male. The female equivalent is Mama Bear, so all Distaff Counterparts should be placed there. When Mama Bear and Papa Wolf team up, it's a Battle Couple and all pairs should be placed there. Parents in Distress is the inversion, when Papa needs to be bailed out by the kids, and Extremely Protective Child is when the child exhibits this kind of general protectiveness over one or both of their parents.

Also, note that this is _not_ the trope for being protective of one's friends, unless of course it is something like an Intergenerational Friendship. In that case, it is okay. Otherwise, don't do it. Tropes about helping friends should go to A Friend in Need, The Power of Friendship etc.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   With Phoenix Wright and Maya, it's a tossup between a father-daughter and brother-sister relationship. Either way, if you try to arrest Maya, he'll defend her with every last _**Objection!**_ he has. If you kidnap her, he'll stall the trial and call in a favor with the prosecution to keep it going until she's safe.. And if she's in actual physical danger, he'll charge across a burning bridge over a hundred-foot drop into an icy river to save her.
    -   Phoenix also displays this for his protégés, Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes, even boasting a Team Dad role in _Duel Destinies_ when Apollo's confused feelings about Athena's apparent connection to the murder of his childhood friend Clay lead to him distancing himself from her, to her clear distress.
    -   In _Investigations_ there's Kay and her 'Uncle Badd'. If Lang hadn't gotten in the way, we probably wouldn't have to worry about giving Shih-na a trial.
    -   From _Trials and Tribulations_, we learn that Bruto Cadaverini is a Papa Wolf to his granddaughter Viola. You don't want to piss this guy off.
    -   In _Dual Destinies_, there's Phoenix and Trucy. When she's taken hostage, he quickly agrees to the demand to hold a re-trial for Simon Blackquill, even having it be held in a bombed courtroom to make sure it happens.
    -   Blackquill is willing to accept execution for a crime he didn't commit to protect Athena.
    -   Damian Tenma from case 2. Throughout the entirety of his incarceration, his daughter Jinxie is never far from his mind. For starters, he repeatedly threatens to break out of jail when he thinks she needs him. Even when he was extorted with his daughter's safety to agree to a town merger, he only objects to it with a secret identity, while publicly pushing for it, even if it means everybody in his home town will hate him. And that's not even mentioning _pretending to be possessed_ in order to disrupt the court proceedings and make himself a valid witness when Jinxie is accused of being an accomplice to his alleged crime. It's made overwhelmingly clear that there's nothing he won't do for Jinxie's sake.
-   Lucio Steelwind from _Tyrion Cuthbert: Attorney of the Arcane_ will resort to extreme measures in order to protect his daughter. Aria is the puppet of King Aster thanks to a Blood Contract he tricked her into signing, and the only way to free her is if Aria or Aster dies. Lucio has his doubts because a kingdom without a king has a bleak future... but then Celeste is revealed to have a claim on the throne as well, so Lucio kills him on the spot even if it means he will spend the rest of his life in prison for regicide.

    Web Animation 

-   Pop from _Happy Tree Friends_ is usually really bad at being a father despite his good intentions, and actually gets his son killed more often than not. However, the few times he actually notices Cub is in danger, he will stop at nothing to save him, like when he successfully fends off a rabid dog in "Doggone It".
-   In _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, the Emperor is very happy with the news that he has biological children. When he finds out what happened to them, though, Warp storms abound over perpetrators' heads.
-   _Homestar Runner_: Strong Mad gets like this when his best friend (nephew? pet?), The Cheat, is physically abused.
-   _Revenge Films_: Claire was being assaulted by her stepfather, the bus driver. Her mother Penny called her biological father Jake, who rushed to the scene and oversped to the point where he was stopped by the police. When Jake told the police officer about the situation, they both went to stop the stepfather from assaulting Claire. Jake gave the bus driver a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown, to the point where the police officer had to restrain him.
-   _RWBY_: Qrow is Yang's maternal uncle but he loves Yang's half-sister Ruby just as much as Yang. Nothing stands between him and his nieces: he rescues Yang and Ruby from a hoard of Grimm when they were young children and he spends Volume 4 secretly following Ruby's group through the wilds of Anima, killing any Grimm that get too close. He only reveals his presence when Ruby's group find themselves fighting the vastly superior Tyrian, charging in to protect Ruby from being seriously injured. When the fourteen-year old Oscar locates Qrow in Volume 5 to reveal he's Ozpin's new reincarnation, it means that Ozpin's vast abilities are limited by Oscar's young, untrained body. When Hazel tries to kill Oscar for being the new host of the man he blames for his sister's death, Qrow's Undying Loyalty to Ozpin combines with his instinct for protecting children; he throws himself in harm's way over and over again to prevent Oscar's death, only stopping once he's too badly injured to fight any more.
-   Wash in _Red vs. Blue_ becomes fiercely protective of the Reds and Blues. He pulls a gun on Carolina when the latter threatened to shoot Tucker. He went out of his way to rescue Donut from an attacking Tex robot, perhaps as a way to make up for shooting Donut earlier. He performed a Heroic Sacrifice, ordering Freckles to collapse a cave to give Tucker, Caboose, Simmons and Grif enough time to escape despite knowing he will be trapped on the other side with the attacking Feds. He stepped in front of Sarge, Donut and Lopez when Locus appeared, readying his gun.
-   _Dreamscape_: Liz is fiercely protective of Dylan, and will dish out a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown to anyone who harms him.
-   _Camp Camp_: David may be a nice and friendly guy, but threatening any of his charges is a _bad_ idea. When Daniel pulled a knife on Max, he _immediately_ tackled the guy to the ground.
-   _Helluva Boss_: Under no circumstances should you even _think_ about hurting Prince Stolas' daughter Octavia. Or else. Example: his on/off lover and main protagonist Blitz told him Octavia had gone missing. His response?
