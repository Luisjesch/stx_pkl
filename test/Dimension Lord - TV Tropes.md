He's got the whole cosmos in his hands. In fact, he _is_ the cosmos.

_"Time for a new start. Clean slate. A re-made universe._ My _universe. Who knows? Maybe one world... one universe — won't be enough."_

A step above Galactic Conqueror but below Guardian of the Multiverse and Multiversal Conqueror, this villain rules an entire universe with an iron fist. He's ready to conquer ours next, just as soon as those pesky heroes from Earth are out of the way...

Dimension Lords are often demons or cosmically powerful mages, or have access to such a high level of Applied Phlebotinum that their technology might as well be magic. They may also be minor gods or Eldritch Abominations. The domains they rule can vary widely in scope, from vast universes to pocket dimensions not much larger than Earth. Most often, their _power_ will be very impressive either way. Despite their nigh-infinite real estate, minions, and personal power, though, Dimension Lords seldom have any more success with their evil plans than do lesser villains...

Note that unlike the Evil Overlord, the Dimension Lord is often the legitimate ruler of his dimension.

If Dimension Lord gets too ambitious, he often becomes Multiversal Conqueror.

Trope name by Dean Shomshak, author of the _Champions_ super-hero RPG sourcebook "The Ultimate Supermage."

Sub-Trope of Cosmic Entity.

Councils Of Angels / Celestial Paragons and Archangels, Demon Lords and Archdevils and physical gods are fairly common Dimensional Lords.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Soul King rules the Soul Society afterlife from a sub-dimension in _Bleach_. He mainly controls the flow of souls entering and leaving while leaving the actual governing to a council of wisemen and judges called _Central 46_.
-   Lune, prince of the Cat Kingdom in _The Cat Returns_.
-   Emperor Muge Zorbados from _Dancougar_.
-   The King of Death rules the Shinigami Realm in the _Death Note_ franchise.
-   Enma Daioh/King Yemma in _Dragon Ball_ controls its version of the afterlife: the Other World. And while his actual fighting-power level is very low by the standards of the series, his Domain Holder\-style control over the place still allows him to subdue the souls of even Physical God\-style villains like Perfect Cell and Kid Buu (even reincarnating the latter into a good-guy human). However, in the _Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn_ movie, his control is temporarily usurped by Reality Warper Janemba, and since Enma/Yemma's is trapped inside his own office, Goku and co. have to step in and help.
-   _Sailor Moon_
    -   Queen Metaria (working through Queen Beryl) and behind Metaria is an even higher up entity named Chaos.
    -   If her name is anything to go by, the manga's Sailor Cosmos might be a benign version of this trope. In the Bad Future whence she hails, all of her allies, every Sailor Scout, and every life, is long dead, and she is the only one still left fighting Chaos, in its purest form. The name "Cosmos" refers to her role to defend the universe.
-   The Anti-Spiral from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_, who did so to prevent the destruction of the universe.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_ has Krigari Ironhand, an interdimensional tyrant and emperor who's already conquered several realities before the heroes have even heard of him.
-   _Doctor Strange_:
    -   Dormammu, the immortal and unstoppable god-tyrant of the mystical "Dark Dimension", worshiped as a deity in thousands of other universes, something worse than a demon, older and far more powerful than any elder god, possessor of sufficient might to have defeated cosmic entities such as the Phoenix Force or Eternity in personal combat, able to rewrite entire universes, and creator of kings of hell of the highest order, with the ultimate goal of slaughtering any rival higher powers, assume control of all life and afterlife, and turn both into an inescapable never-ending torture camp from birth to death and anything beyond. Arch-enemy and most dangerous foe of Doctor Strange, and the first classic Dimension Lord. Arguably the most genuinely terrifying absolutely evil recurring villain in the Marvel roster. Some of his plots stretch billions of years before coming to fruition, but luckily he's usually extremely arrogant and not a particularly inventive schemer. Then again he doesn't need to be, as he is one of the most powerful known Eldritch Abominations in existence. His twin sister Umar also fills this role. She is the more dangerous of the two, despite being less powerful, because she is intelligent and very patient — fortunately she doesn't care about destroying our world as much as her brother does.
    -   Shuma-Gorath is another one of these, as well as a Multiversal Conqueror. He's even more powerful than Dormammu! _The Thanos Imperative_ reveals that Shuma-Gorath is just one member of an entire pantheon of dimension conquering abominations called the Many-Angled Ones.
    -   Dr. Strange also regularly encounters various other dimension lords who are slightly lower-tiered than Dormammu: Lord Tazza, Aggamon of the Purple Dimension, Tiboro... the list goes on.
    -   Eternity is the Dimension Lord for _our_ dimension (well, the mainstream Marvel universe dimension), overlapping heavily with Anthropomorphic Personification and Cosmic Entity. Dormammu once tried to fight him directly and got curb-stomped. Currently the page image.
-   _Fantastic Four_ gives us Annihilus, ruler of the Negative Zone. Despite having godlike power, his attempts at conquering our world are routinely thwarted by four super-powered scientists in spandex suits. Until _Annihilation_, where several galactic superpowers have to team up to take him down.
-   Mephisto, lord of one of several Hells in the Marvel Universe.
    -   An interesting case is Illyana Rasputin/Magik, who is a Dimensional Overlord and (usually) one of the good guys.
    -   While Meffy is the most commonly used one, we also have other demonic overlords: Satannish, Nightmare, Belasco, etc. etc. Occasionally they claim to be the same guy.
    -   Daimon Hellstrom is also lord of a Hell Dimension and is all powerful when there. He spends more time on Earth, though, and is also usually one of the good guys.
    -   Also Hela, Queen of the realms of Hel and Niffleheim and the Asgardian Goddess of Death. She is a member of the Hell Lords along with Mephisto and Dormammu.
-   Trigon the Terrible, demonic overlord of The DCU and father of _Teen Titans_ member Raven.
-   The Anti-Monitor, ruler of the Antimatter Universe prior to and during DC's _Crisis on Infinite Earths_.
-   The Time Trapper from _Legion of Super-Heroes_ offers a somewhat different spin on this in that the dimension he rules over is the DCU itself, during its dying years.
-   _Fantastic Four_ villain Hyperstorm is Mister Fantastic's future grandson from an alternate universe, a psychic mutant with a level of power so absurdly off the scale that he was able to conquer his entire universe without much serious effort.
-   _Judge Dredd_: Judge Death, leader of the Dark Judges, is the ruler of an alternate dimension called Deadworld. He and his brethren (and the Sisters of Death) culled their world of all life long ago before crossing over into Dredd's dimension to spread the gospel.
-   The titular Villain Protagonist of _Teknophage_, by Neil Gaiman, from the mostly forgotten mid-90s publisher Tekno Comix. He was a corporate dimensional conqueror purely for the purpose of satisfying his own gluttonous urgings to eat the most predatory (and thus savory) souls by making worlds so horrible that they produced assassination attempts against him. He was also a powerful telepath and especially immortal. He was also a dinosaur.
-   The titular protagonist of _The Sandman (1989)_ is, as Lord of the Dreaming, a rare non-villain example. Each of his siblings has a Domain of their own, although his seems to be the only one with a significant number of other inhabitants.
    -   Interestingly Satan is technically not one due to then-recent events in the DCU mandating a triumvirate. Neil Gaiman plays this as an indulgence on Lucifer's part, and later subverts it: When Lucifer quits and actually shuts Hell down throwing everyone out and leaving Dream the key. He goes on to lord over a nice bar. And then he makes his own universe in _Lucifer_. But he's not very big on the 'ruling' part, basically telling anyone who lives there that his only commandment is that he is _not_ to be worshipped.
-   The _Star Wars Expanded Universe_ gives us Emperor Palpatine, once he gets better. When not enough power is enough, he wanted to become a god, so that he could live off the Force of his followers, and then he would conquer the universe! With Luke as his high priest, of course.
-   Mojo from _X-Men_ rules a dimension where whoever who has the highest television ratings becomes the leader. This also applies to Mojo II, Mojo V, a babified version of Apocalypse, and in at least one alternate future the heroic Shatterstar. Since television in that dimension takes the form of deadly war games, it tends to have a high turnover in leadership.
-   Minor _Spider-Man_ villain the Spot is basically a Dimension Lord whose "dimension" doubles as a Void Between the Worlds. His powers allow him to both generate portals at will and to control how they function — whether they link two spots in the same dimension together or if they simply open into the void. This makes him a surprisingly dangerous foe, especially if opponents make the mistake of following him into the void itself, but it's undermined by his own ineffectualness.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Hottie 3: The Best Fan Fic in the World_, Emperor Vakudos is the ruler of a dimension called the Midnight Cage.
-   In the _Pony POV Series_, all of the Elders are this to their own realms: Fauna Luster has the realm that her Alicorn children live in, the Father of Alicorns has Pony Heaven, Havoc has Pony Hell, and Entropy has Oblivion (in fact it seems that they _are_ their realms). Meanwhile, all of their children have their own separate private realms within the ones controlled by Their Parents that they control themselves, but the Elders seem to be able to override that control. It should be noted that the Draconequi Elders are more neutral entities while the Alicorn Elders are fully benevolent. As shown with the Fallen Alicorn, Morning Star, an Alicorn's realm can become twisted and grotesque as they become increasingly evil; while this doesn't affect the Alicorn's physical appearance, a twisted realm does show their true character.
    -   Liberalis, one of the Minor Arcana Alicorns, is a bit different from the others in that her realm isn't in the spirit realm with the others. Rather, as Concept of the Mortal World, mortal reality is her domain.
-   _Queen of All Oni_: If one counts Jade's mindscape as a dimension, then The Queen, as dominant Aspect since Jade's Face–Heel Turn, qualifies, especially since she crushed Hero's rebellion. That said, Father still controls Home (Jade's soul), so she doesn't fit the criteria 100 percent.
-   _Ruby Pair_: The Gaol Master is the ruler of the Gaols & Ghouls world.
-   In _Split Second (My Little Pony)_, Sparkle hijacks the magic holding together the pocket dimension inside the _Power Ponies_ comic book. She temporarily becomes a Reality Warper, with command and authority over the entire dimension and its laws of physics, but is ejected a few seconds later.
-   In _Super Milestone Wars 2_, The Biggest Bad is ruler of the dimension, Voidspace. And there's Multiversal Conqueror, King Dyce, who rules over his home Alternate Universe as well as multiple dimensions.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _The Book of Life_, La Muerte is queen of _The Land of the Remembered_ and her husband Xibalba rules _The Land of the Forgotten_.
    -   Word of God says that Xibalba has a brother who rules _The Land of The Cursed_, an even worse Hell for more wicked people. Also that La Muerte's sister, _La Noche_ rules _The Land Of The Unknown_ with her husband, _El Chamuco_.
-   The Other Mother in _Coraline_ rules her own small world, similar to the original book.
-   _Felix the Cat: The Movie_: "You think you can stop me? The Duke of Zill? The new King of Oriana? The ruler of our dimension?!"
-   Yivo from the _Futurama_ movie _The Beast with a Billion Backs_ is an Eldritch Abomination who is the sole inhabitant of shkler own universe and wants to enter into a romantic relationship with everyone in ours.
-   President Business rules the universe in _The LEGO Movie_. It turns out the whole movie is a child playing with Lego in a basement, with President Business being based on his workaholic father. The lego Emmett is able to think and move to some degree in the real world implying that his Lego world may be real.
-   The Mayor of Halloweentown from _The Nightmare Before Christmas_ and Santa Claus would be one for _Christmas Town_. The Easter Bunny presumably rules the Easter themed Holiday World.
-   If you count the arcade games in _Wreck-It Ralph_ as dimensions, King Candy rules _Sugar Rush_. He's actually a refugee from a broken game who crossed over and hacked the game to make the denizens forget that Vanellope Von Scweetz was the rightful ruler.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Ming The Merciless is said to rule the entire universe in _Flash Gordon (1980)_. In actual practice, he rules one planet and its moons; he just _claims_ the rest. He tests all the other planets in the universe every thousand years and wipes them out if they show signs of recognizing alien interference. After Ming dies, Prince Barin takes over, and it's implied that he'll rule more fairly if he doesn't give the other planets and moons home rule.
-   King Fausto rules the Sixth Dimension in _Forbidden Zone_.
-   Leviathan, the Eldritch Abomination that rules Hell in the _Hellraiser_ franchise.
-   Jareth, the Goblin King of the _Labyrinth_. Though the sequel manga says there are other kingdoms in the same world.
-   Ofelia's parents shown ruling the Underworld at the end of _Pan's Labyrinth_.
-   The Master Control Program that rules The Grid in _TRON_.
    -   CLU rules it in _TRON: Legacy_ and intends to conquer Earth.
-   President Koopa of Dinohattan in _Super Mario Bros. (1993)_. Not hard because that's the only city on the planet.

    Literature 

-   Older Than Steam: At least in the standard _Paradise Lost_\-influenced portrayal, Satan is the near-absolute ruler of the dimension called Hell.
-   The Queen of Hearts rules Wonderland in _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ and most of its adaptations.
-   _Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest_: Big Bad Ehitorujue, the god of the Standard Japanese Fantasy Setting responsible for kidnapping Hajime and his classmates and teacher from Japan, turns out to be tiring of ruining the lives of the fantasy world's people and plans to invade Earth and do the same there.
-   The Beldam has control over her own Baby Planet dimension in _Coraline_.
-   In Jack Vance's "Guyal of Sfere", the demon Blikdak is evidently foundational for the very existence of his home dimension, Jeldred — when Blikdak is destroyed, Jeldred ceases to exist. He is referred to as its "Ruler-Divinity".
-   The Ruler Of The Universe in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ franchise, though he doesn't know he is or believe that the universe exists outside his imagination.
-   Queen Ozma rules the Magical Land of Oz. Although the original _Land of Oz_ portray Oz as a magically protected country on Earth, later authors like Gregory Maguire, Philip José Farmer and Robert A. Heinlein have it as Another Dimension.

    Live Action TV 

-   _Angel_: The monks of Pylea are hinted to be acolytes of the Senior Partners.
-   Dark Specter from _Power Rangers in Space_ is the overlord of the United Alliance of Evil, which has already conquered most of the universe (excluding Earth).
    -   _VR Troopers_ has Grimlord, secretly human industrialist Karl Ziktor; Once an Episode he transforms into his grotesque Grimlord form and enters either his Virtual Dungeon (season 1 and early season 2) or Virtual Dark Fortress (rest of season 2), where his subordinates typically greet him with a "Hail Grimlord, Master of the Virtual World!" or somesuch. Virtual Reality tends to be not much more than the BBC Quarry, though, and all of Grimlord's plans revolve around breaking through the reality barrier to conquer the real world.
-   Glorificus from _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ used to be one, until she got banished to earth and forced to timeshare Ben's body. Her entire arc is about her attempt to get back to her own dimension, without regard for the destruction the portal would cause on Earth.
-   Omega, from _Doctor Who_, is the absolute, godlike ruler of an entire universe made of anti-matter. Subverted by the fact that he's the _only guy there_. And he wants out.
    -   The Celestial Toymaker occupies a separate universe which he controls absolutely.
    -   Time, being a dimension, makes every Time Lord one of these. Or, as of 2010, the Doctor himself, since he's the only Time Lord left. It's probably best that he _doesn't_ start thinking about this too much, or show what he could really do with this status, as "The Waters of Mars" showed. It almost made the Doctor finally go off the deep end and he started referring to himself as "Time Lord Victorious". The one thing what caused him to return to normal is Adelaide (the famous person he saved, who _wasn't meant to be alive_) killing herself to save the world, and specifically herself, from the Doctor's hubris.
    -   House is the only truly living thing in a "bubble universe" somewhere beyond our own. He's the size of a planet, but can transfer consciousnesses into other bodies, including his own into the TARDIS. Because he's the only thing in his universe, he has to obtain nutrition from ours.
-   In _Flash Gordon (2007)_ series, Emperor Ming rules Mongo, which is a parallel version of Earth instead of a planet in our universe.
-   His Divine Shadow from _Lexx_ rules the entire Light Universe.
-   _Metal Heroes_
    -   The Makuu, Madou and Fuuma organizations all ruled over their own dimensions, which could increase the power of any monsters that got pulled in.
    -   Gaohm of _Juukou B-Fighter_ controls his own pocket dimension called the "Gaohm Zone". Once an Episode, he'd pull both the B-Fighters and the Monster of the Week in to do battle.
-   In _Sliders_, the Kromaggs rule multiple dimensions.
-   The Prophets in _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ are the masters of their own dimension, though it is unclear how large the inside of the wormhole actually is. However, they seem to display almost absolute power inside it and in the past occasionally helped the natives of the nearby planet Bajor, who in return worship them as gods.
-   _Stranger Things_: The Mind Flayer is the ultimate creature in the Upside-Down, serving as the manifestation and ruler of the dimension's Hive Mind. Then Season 4 reveals that Henry Creel/One/Vecna is the true master, having taken control of the Hive Mind after Eleven banished him to the Upside-Down and shaping the Mind Flayer to his image.
-   _Super Sentai_:
    -   The Vader Clan of _Denshi Sentai Denziman_ hail from their own parallel world known as the Vader Dimension.
    -   By the time _Uchu Sentai Kyuranger_ begins, the Space Shogunate Jark Matter have already conquered the whole universe.
-   _Ultra Series_: Yapool is the absolute ruler of a dimension that he uses as his base of operations. He creates his "Choju" in it and can freely leave it to enter our world, and so can his creations. Likewise, when beaten he can always retreat back to it to recover.

    Religion and Mythology 

-   In Christianity, Satan is this for Hell. Although it depends on the writer. While the idea has no basis in the Bible, much of it is derived from epic poems such as _Paradise Lost_, mixture between Hellenistic ideals and the Christian church during its infancy, and grimoires written by priests and theologians.
    -   In the Book of Revelation, Death is mentioned as owning some sort of netherworld which will be thrown into the lake of fire.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Skarn the Shaper and Tyrannon the Conqueror from the _Champions_ Universe, created by Dean Shomshak as examples of this trope. Not to mention Istvatha V'han, who doesn't call herself "Empress of a Billion Dimensions" for nothing.
-   The Demon Lords and Archdevils of the Great Wheel cosmology in _Dungeons & Dragons_ (used in most campaign settings of the 2nd Edition and the setting of _Planescape_) each rule over an entire layer of the Abyss and the Nine Hells. Except for Asmodeus, who has granted the other eight hells as fiefs to the other archdevils, and Graz'zt, whose realm of Azzagrat consists not only of one, but three layers, which elevates him to the same level of power as the much more stronger Demogorgon and Orcus.
    -   The Drow's evil spider goddess Lolth rules her own layer of the Abyss as well, the Demonweb Pits, in the Great Wheel cosmology; in the 3e _Forgotten Realms_ Great Tree cosmology, she managed to spin it off into its own separate plane.
-   In the original editions of _Mage: The Ascension_, some of those who ascend actually BECAME their own extradimensional realms, where they were absolute, being both Dimension Lord and Dimension at the same time.
-   In _Magic: The Gathering_, this is you. And Yawgmoth was this to Phyrexia.
-   As is Omega, Lord of the Terminus from the _Mutants & Masterminds_ default setting of Freedom City.
-   A splatbook for the Palladium Game _Nightbane_ included detailed rules on how to create your own Astral Realm (on the Astral Plane, natch) as a player character, and thus begin play as a (small-scale) Dimension Lord. The Nightlords could also count, ruling over a Dark World and seeking to conquer its counterpart: Earth.

    Video Games 

-   _Arkanoid_: Whoever is in charge of Dimension-Controlling fort Doh rules the dimension in which the escape craft "Vaus" is trapped.
-   _Asura's Wrath_: The Golden Spider/Chakravartin rules the dimension between life and death, Naraka.
-   Chzo, from the games of the _Chzo Mythos_, is a pain elemental that rules the World of Magick as it's King.
-   _City of Heroes_
    -   Rularuu the Ravager, a Galactus clone turned into a Dormammu clone when he was exiled to the Shadow Shard.
    -   DJ Zero, is a rare non-evil Dimension Lord who has turned his own private pocket dimension (possibly a sealed-off section of the Shadow Shard) into a dance club for superhumans.
    -   Tyrant has to qualify as well, what with ruling the entire Mirror Universe with an iron fist and having already conquered several other dimensions, and setting his eyes on ours...
    -   Nemesis counts as well.
    -   By the same token, Lord of War Hro'Dohtz of the Rikti; a good chunk of the plot in the RWZ is trying to destabilize his control of the Rikti Homeworld.
-   _Devil Survivor 2_ allows the protagonist to become one in one of the endings of the Triangulum Arc, by ascending the Heavenly Throne and becoming the new Administrator.
-   The various Overlords of the various Netherworlds from Nippon Ichi's strategy games. In particular, Laharl from _Disgaea_ and Zetta from _Makai Kingdom_, who're main characters of their respective games. Interestingly, the title of Overlord is inheritable — you only get to keep it until someone stronger beats the crap out of you for it. _Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance_ reveals that not all Overlords actually rule a Netherworld. Instead, they achieve Enlightenment Superpowers by achieving inner peace. This is described as becoming the Overlord of the Netherworld in their own heart. The legendary Demon Fist Goldion achieved this and later Zeroken does as well.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, the Daedric Princes each rule over their own plane(s) of Oblivion, the infinite void surrounding Mundus, the mortal plane. Within their plane, the Daedric Princes possess almost absolute power. According to some interpretations, these planes may be closer to a Genius Loci, with the plane itself _being_ the Daedric Prince, and the (mostly) humanoid avatars they take when dealing with mortals being A Form You Are Comfortable With.
-   This is Ultimecia's goal in _Final Fantasy VIII_, to absorb all time and space into herself and create a new universe in her image.
-   In _Final Fantasy XI_, Diabolos is the overlord of the Dynamis Dimension.
-   This was Illua's goal in _Final Fantasy Tactics A2_ — she made a pact with the Neukhia in order to gain more power, and planned to harness the Zellea Rift to achieve total domination over time and space.
-   The Emperor's goal in _Dissidia Final Fantasy_ is to arrange for Cosmos and Chaos to die while he uses a Dark Crystal to seize a portion of power from one of them (it's unclear which the Crystal takes power from), leaving him to rule over World B. Note that in _Dissidia_, "World B" isn't an actual planet, closer to being an alternate dimension that rests atop the Void Between the Worlds that acts as the hub of the _Final Fantasy_ multiverse.
-   _Freedom Force_:
    -   Lord Dominion, a loose pastiche of Galactus and Darkseid. A tad unusual in that the dimension he's lord over is the "normal" universe — Earth is the _only_ planet he hasn't conquered yet (he peppered the world with the superpower-causing agent to watch the humans destroy themselves for his amusement).
    -   The Greater-Scope Villain, Timemaster, is even more so — being a Galactus Expy who rules a Place Beyond Time. In fact, he and Dominion are revealed to be in an Evil Versus Evil stalemate for ownership of this universe.
-   If you choose the Infinity Ball as your first invention in the Asura Storyline of _Guild Wars 2_, the final boss of the story chain is one of these who has set their eye on your version of Tyria. They also happen to be you.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_, Zant rules the Twilight Realm (though he usurped the position from Midna); he then sets his sights on the World of Light. Unsurprisingly, Ganondorf is behind it.
    -   Ganondorf is, of course, ruler of the Dark World/Sacred Land in _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_.
    -   Oshus rules the _World Of The Ocean King_ in _Phantom Hourglass_.
    -   Uncle Rupee has his own dimension, _Rupeeland_ in _Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland_.
-   You in _Minecraft_, albeit to different degrees based on game mode. Even a lowly survival player can reshape the world at will, conjure items into existence by reshaping matter and is effectively immortal due to infinitely respawning on death (although some unfortunate lava placement can make them wish they wouldn't). A creative player is immune to everything and can destroy even unbreakable objects at a touch, create unlimited amounts of anything, fly at high speeds, teleport at will, rewrite the very rules of reality and kill every other living entity on the entire plane with a single utterance. Can cross into Multiversal Conqueror if your actions in the main menu are factored in, allowing you to create and destroy entire realities in seconds.
-   _Mortal Kombat_: Shao Kahn rules as Emperor of the evil, mutant-infested dimension known as Outworld. He is constantly scheming to conquer Earth. Kahn goes up to Multiversal Conqueror, but he hates Earth for defeating him.
-   The Forgotten God rules over the abyss. Later the protagonist, the titular _Overlord_, can take over the god's role, ascending from an Evil Overlord to this position.
-   _Pokémon_ has Giratina, a Pokémon who rules over the Distortion World (a universe parallel to the normal one) and is, in fact, the only native inhabitant. It's unclear, however, if Giratina is _meant_ to rule it to keep things in balance, or if the Distortion World also acts as its prison (Giratina having been banished from the normal world for its violence).
-   The main villain of _Soul Nomad & the World Eaters_ is a literal Dimension Lord as well. And the Big Good Haephnes is a token good guy example of this, since she rules the Crapsack World where the game takes place (it's not crapsack through her fault, mind, but manipulations of the Big Bad).
-   Algon in the _Soul Series_ claims the Astral Chaos, the extra-dimensional plane where the Soul Edge and Soul Calibur swords were created, as his personal kingdom. He serves as the series Greater-Scope Villain for being the first wielder of the Soul Edge.
-   Dimentio in _Super Paper Mario_ tries to take this position by destroying all the dimensions and rebuilding them in his own image.
    -   Also in _Super Paper Mario_, Count Bleck rules from a castle floating in its own empty void-like dimension, possibly earning him the title. Even if there isn't much there.
    -   Also Smithy in _Super Mario RPG._
-   Tabuu in _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_, rules over Subspace. In the Smash Bros. Dojo, Master Hand is described as the Lord of the Smash Bros. world. At least, until Tabuu makes it a puppet...
-   The Guardian from the later _Ultima_ games. Arguably Lord British from _Ultima IV_ on.
-   While not necessarily villainous, The Elemental Lords from _World of Warcraft_ are an example of this. Each of them banished to their own Pocket Dimension of a Pocket Dimension that they're free to rule over to prevent their in-fighting from causing chaos on Azeroth. In _Cataclysm_ the two that were villains were actually subservient to the expansion's Big Bad Deathwing and Greater-Scope Villain N'Zoth, most actually follow Blue-and-Orange Morality based on their element.
    -   Dimensius the All-Devouring is presented this way in _The Burning Crusade_. He rules over a Pocket Dimension known as the Void (where all the Voidwalker demons come from) and emerges to devour worlds - most recently, Ka'Resh, where the Ethereals come from.

    Visual Novels 

-   As of Episode 6 of _Umineko: When They Cry_, the new Territory Lord of Beatrice's Fragment, the Endless Sorcerer BATTLER.

    Webcomics 

-   Mynd of _Bob and George_ claims this when he first meets Bob, but the author admits in his notes that he's probably lying, or that his dimension is tiny.
-   _El Goonish Shive_ brings us Lord Tedd. Or, rather, did; with the New First Comics, he appears to have vanished from the series entirely. Lord Tedd was later mentioned (and lampshaded) when Elliot was talking to Tedd's father on the phone after being attack by the Bloodgrem.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: Each of the Demiurges holds dominion over 111,111 universes. You heard that number right; they use Reality Warper keystones to control dimensional rifts, and with enough practice they can rewrite the laws of reality for a very large volume of space by using the properties of different dimensions. The Earth we know technically belongs to one of the universes of Mother Om, but apparently she simply hasn't got around to actively bending this planet to her power, so people here remain unaware of all this stuff.
-   _Sluggy Freelance_:
    -   The Dimension of Pain is ruled by an entity known only as the Demon King. The Demon King gets relatively little face time, however, and leaves most of the running of the place to his subordinate Demon Lord. (The guest strips by Ian McDonald also have the demons beholden to some kind of interdimensional fiendish bureaucracy.)
    -   Deplora (a "Demon Queen" but equivalent to a Demon Lord, not King) seems to rule the Dimension of Grief, except when the above mentioned guest strips introduce the Demon King's counterpart, the Grief Monarch. So probably he rules the Dimension of Grief.

    Web Original 

-   In _The Crew of the Copper-Colored Cupids_, various individuals own smallish pocket dimensions: the boyish Prince of the House is in some important metaphysical sense in charge of the Prime Universe, the Queen of the Black Market rules the Interdimensional Black Market, Madame Tarsa has godlike power over an entire set of mini-worlds in a dimensionally-transcendental toy chest, and Cupida Hartnell is arguably this to the Cupid Homeworld itself. There are also the three Embodiments, Lord Thymon, Lady Spatium and Squire Psykha, who rule/protect/embody the Void Between the Worlds.

    Western Animation 

-   It's implied that Discord from _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ is this. His home is a Pocket Dimension World of Chaos.
