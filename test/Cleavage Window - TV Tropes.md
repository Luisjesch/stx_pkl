_"You have a **bullet proof** fabric and you want to cut a **hole** in it right over your **heart???** Are you **insane?**"_

A cut in a woman's top that shows her breast cleavage, whether it's on the top or front side. It doesn't matter the shape or the size, as long as the window is completely enclosed and clearly shows breast cleavage. It also doesn't matter about the rest of the outfit, as this can be on a bathing suit, a sweater, a Leotard of Power, a Minidress of Power, or a grand Pimped-Out Dress.

If the cleavage window creates a gap in the protection of a character's chest armor, that armor is a Chainmail Bikini.

Obviously a form of Fanservice, and likely Author Appeal.

Compare Most Common Superpower, Navel-Deep Neckline (which can overlap if the window drops far enough), Impossibly-Low Neckline, Naked in Mink, Male Gaze. Sister Trope to Navel Window, which applies the same general idea of exposure to the character's belly button without fully baring the midriff.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ah! My Goddess_: Belldandy. Yes, _Belldandy_. It's the only skin showing in that outfit besides her face.
-   Zessica Wong from _Aquarion Evol_ wears a short halterneck crop with a very large opening exposing her cleavage.
-   Ms. Fanservice Haruka Gracia from _Basquash!_ wears dress with a large cleavage cutout.
-   Isabella from _Beelzebub_ has a small opening in the chest area of her maid uniform.
-   The title heroine's outfit in _Cutey Honey_ is a sleeveless unitard with a huge diamond-shaped cutout that even shows off a bit of stomach. In _Re: Cutie Honey_ she wears a halterneck crop top with a heart-shaped hole over her cleavage.
-   Yin of the _Darker than Black_ franchise costume contains a mild version of this. She's far from well-endowed but, the combination of her dress and throw create a patch of visible skin.
-   In one instance of _Death Note_, model/actress Misa Amane attempts to get Matsuda out of a jam with a roomful of shady businessmen by pretending to want to be a model/spokesperson for them. She is seen with a tank top with a heart-shaped cut that revealed her cleavage.
-   _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_: Mitsuri's top is almost completely unbuttoned to accommodate her breasts, which results in a diamond-shaped window that shows off her cleavage. Despite how much she moves around when fighting, nothing indecent is ever shown. It's even lampshaded by Muichiro, who rather bluntly points out that her breasts could spill out of her uniform at any moment.
-   The _Dirty Pair_ had these in some of their appearances, when the character design included collars that buttoned up but a large diamond-shaped opening exposing their cleavages.
-   In the first season of _Galaxy Angel_, Forte wears a dress with an opening showing off most of her chest (barely held up by thin straps) and Ranpha wears a Chinese-inspired dress with a diamond-shaped cutout above her cleavage. They were covered up in the second season onward due to the show being picked up by a network with strict content rules.
-   Princess Piña Co Lada in _Gate_ has a window exposing her cleavage in just about all of her outfits, including the armor she wears in battle.
-   Some characters in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind_, notably Giorno Giovanna, Bruno Bucciarati, and Vinegar Doppio, are amongst the Rare Male Example of cleavage windows.
    -   Rikiel from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean_ has this too. The English dub even has Ermes lampshade this, calling him "that bastard with the boob window."
-   _Kaiju Girl Caramelise_: When Manatsu confronts Arata in his apartment building lobby, she is dressed in a rubber replica of Harugon with a heart-shaped gap just above her bust.
-   In the anime _Kill la Kill_, Satsuki's Kamui Junketsu in its armor form has an opening that shows off her cleavage.
-   Millie's default outfit in _Lost Universe_ fits this trope. The swimsuit she wears in episode four has an interesting variation on the idea, in that the window is just below her breasts.
-   Arf's outfit in the first season of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_ had a crop top with a diamond-shaped keyhole. There's also Linith, Fate's Parental Substitute before the series started, who wore an outfit that comprised an outer-coat with buttoned collar and buttoned below her chest and dress with a diamond-shaped cutout above her cleavage.
-   Medaka's student council outfit in _Medaka Box_ has a huge opening on the chest area that shows off a lot of cleavage. Amusingly, it becomes a major plot point because it violates the dress code.
-   _The Misfit of Demon King Academy_: When the reincarnated Emila Lud(o)well returns in episode five of the second season, the rags she found herself dressing up in show off a fair amount of her cleavage.
-   A number of Robes in _My-Otome_ cover their wearers from head-to-toe but leave opening to show off cleavage, mainly Maria's, Fiar's, Chie's second Robe, and Mai's. Akane's Robe _just_ has it: only a little bit of fabric keeps it from Impossibly-Low Neckline. Oddly, Haruka's (for lack of a better term) off-duty uniform has a diamond-shaped cleavage cutout, but not her Robe, as is the case with Una Shamrock in _My-Otome 0~S.ifr~_.
-   Ran in _One Piece_ wears a crop top with a window hole in the middle.
-   Keyne Aqua's outfit from _Photon_ combines a Bolero jacket with an exercise leotard that leaves a rhombus-shaped space which frames her breastbone. Otherwise, Keyne goes bopping about in her birthday suit.
-   Mizuho in _Please Teacher!_ could, in her alien outfit, open up a cleavage cutout by will, and did so in her attempt to seduce Kei.
-   Madoka Kaname from _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ sports one on the dress she wears as Ultimate Madoka. Kyoko also has one where her Soul Gem rests.
    -   Kazumi, on both her outfits in _Puella Magi Kazumi Magica_. Mirai also sports one of these.
    -   Haruka Kanade and Arisa Narumi in _Puella Magi Suzune Magica_.
-   Apple from _Red Photon Zillion_ wears a blouse with a neckline that plunges at least three inches, with a tiny _strap_ for a collar. The result is a teardrop-shaped window that shows a small amount of cleavage.
-   Melissa's cleric dress in _Rune Soldier Louie_ has a diamond-shaped opening show off her cleavage. Genie's halterneck crop top has two opening, one on top of her cleavage and one on top of her Underboobs.
-   In _The Seven Deadly Sins_ Diane has one of these on her Leotard of Power, while Jericho wears an armor with a hole on the front that shows part of her breasts and bra.
-   Tiara of _Shamanic Princess_, when she's not in her Super Mode sports a heart-shaped cleavage cutout.
-   Fittingly, her Expy, Golden Darkness (Yami) of _To Love Ru_ also has one, though in a diamond pattern and a single piece of cloth.

    Comic Books 

-   Emma Frost's Phoenix Five costume in _Avengers vs. X-Men_ has an enclosed opening on the top portion right above her cleavage.
-   Ra's Al-Ghul's daughter Talia Al-Ghul often wears a gown with a cleavage window in the _Batman_ comics.
-   Invisible Woman of _Fantastic Four_ had one, shaped like the figure 4, in her Stripperiffic 1990s outfit. On more than one occasion has it been pointed out the physical _improbability_ of maintaining the appearance of a number 4 in such a manner.
-   In _Grendel_, Christine Spar's street clothing often has cleavage windows, although her costume as Grendel doesn't.
-   One of the several forms taken by the Marvel Universe version of Death is a grey-skinned, tattooed woman wearing a corset with a cleavage opening. Yes, The Grim Reaper herself has the Most Common Superpower.
-   _Icon_: Rocket's first costume is a full bodysuit and a jacket covered her from head-to-toe but the bodysuit had a cleavage cutout, to Icon's vague disapproval. Her second costume, which Icon designed, eschewed this.
-   _Phantom Lady_ in 1946 had one of the first ones with her costume which was a mini dress with a plunging neckline and cape wrapped around her neck. Most of the other costumes merely had an Impossibly-Low Neckline.
-   Many of Power Girl's costumes have openings that exposes her cleavage (one of which is the trope picture). There are a number of issues where Power Girl explains the rationale behind it but the reason seems to change every time. It serves as distraction, it shows that she's proud of her body, and she can't decide on a Chest Insignia. As for making her more vulnerable, Power Girl at least has the excuse of being Kryptonian, meaning that she's Immune to Bullets (unless they happen to be magic projectiles or kryptonite projectiles, which then would make this point completely moot, especially since Kryptonite Is Everywhere).
-   _Supergirl_:
    -   In _Supergirl Vol. 5_ issue #34, Catherine Grant wears a red dress which has an enclosed opening on the top portion right above her cleavage.
    -   In the _New 52_ book, Supergirl and Power Girl argue the latter's cleavage-displaying costume.
        
        **Power Girl:** Uh... **Old**?  
        **Supergirl:** No, not **old**. Just old...**er**... Older than me, anyway. And maybe a little too old for that outfit, too.  
        **Power Girl:** What's wrong with this outfit?  
        **Supergirl:** C'mon, Kara. It's a bit... much, don't you think?  
        **Power Girl:** It came from **your** wardrobe, Supergirl!  
        **Supergirl:** Yeah, but I never actually **wore** it.
        
-   Taken to its extreme in _Transmetropolitan_ #24. Channon Yarrow (an ex-stripper) wears a backless, strapless dress with an Impossibly-Low Neckline, sides slit to the hips, thigh-to-knee diagonal hemlines (opposing angles front and back), armpit length gloves, and no less than _ten_ triangular windows; three on the outside of each glove, one on each side of her waist, one exposing her bellybutton, and one _fully exposing her left nipple._ She wears the triangle of fabric as a necklace.
-   Kimura, X-23's Arch-Enemy, often wears bodysuits with cutouts above her breasts.

    Fan Works 

-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: As mentioned in "Fairy Attack": The fairy sisters' uniforms:
    
    The smaller gap in the front, strategically positioned to reveal a good amount of cleavage, had to be for vanity purposes.
    
-   _Evangelion 303_: In chapter 16 Rei slowly starts to emerge out of her shell and tries different things, including to wear a dress with a circle-shaped cut above her breasts. Here's a preview.
-   In _Imaginary Seas_, Percy is baffled by his father's armor, which has a gaping hole to expose his chest. It doesn't matter much given his Nigh-Invulnerability, but he feels indecent because of it and quickly looks for a shirt to cover himself up.
-   _Superwomen of Eva 2: Lone Heir of Krypton_: During her _Power Girl_ phase, Asuka's costume had a very large cleavage and a cord stretching across her neck, shaping a triangular cutout above her breasts.
-   In "Christmas in Kansas", part of the _Sorrowful and Immaculate Hearts_ series, there's a conversation about superhero costume design, and Diana jokingly suggests that what Batman's suit is lacking is a bat-shaped cleavage window.
-   Played for laughs in _Skyhold Academy Seasons_, when the staff are designing costumes for the school play. Varric has a conversation with Bethany in which he reminds her that he needs to wear something which will show off his chest hair.

    Films — Animation 

-   Queen Tara from _Epic (2013)_ wears a green dress with a huge opening in the chest area.
-   Power Girl got to keep her real costume — complete with this feature — in her first true animated appearance, _Superman/Batman: Public Enemies_. (Probably because the movie was direct-to-DVD.)

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Blood Pi_: In her first girl's night in with Agnis, Amber wears a black dress with a little cleavage window.
-   In _Dragonball Evolution_, Lord Piccolo's henchwoman Mai wears a red jumpsuit with an opening above her chest.
-   Attorney General "Fun Bags" in _Idiocracy_ wears a dress with a teardrop-shaped opening showing off her cleavage.
-   _Spirits of the Dead_: One of the actresses at the awards show is clad in a tight dress with a prominent Cleavage Window to show off her large breasts. And if that wasn't enough, director Federico Fellini zooms in for a tight closeup of said breasts as the actress gets up to accept an award.
-   Psylocke has a unique two-pane Cleavage Window in _X-Men: Apocalypse_.

    Literature 

-   For the _Forgotten Realms_ novel _Azure Bonds_, the protagonist Alias is depicted in Clyde Caldwell's cover art<small>◊</small> wearing chain mail armour with a large gap between her breasts. In the novel she is described as wearing this outfit unwillingly and only in the closing chapters, with the narrator calling it "showy, but impractical".
    
    -   This has been handwaved as either ceremonial armour, or to allow those controlling her through the eponymous azure bonds to kill her easily if she showed signs of rebellion. The image has been used throughout _Dungeons & Dragons_ media and the spin-off computer game, _Curse of the Azure Bonds_.
    -   In the game modules, the armor is enchanted and either extends mystic protection to the open area, or the armor protecting her chest is invisible.
        -   A later novel in the series finally offered an explanation, saying that the armor was made by a vain sorceress who wanted to show off the goods, and did add a protection spell covering the "window" to keep it from being a liability.
    -   The entire thing was lampshaded when Alias guest-starred in the _Forgotten Realms_ comic book in 1989, and the halfling Foxilon Cardluck had the following exchange with her:
    
    **Foxy:** Uhh... Doesn't that armor get _drafty_ sometimes?  
    **Alias:** It's enchanted.  
    **Foxy:** _(under his breath)_ Oh, I'll just _bet_ it is.
    
-   In _The Wheel of Time_ Ebou Dari dresses are described as having an oval cutout exposing the inner slopes of the wearer's bosom. On married local women, this is to frame the marriage knife, whose hilt nestles between the breasts.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Adventures of Slim Goodbody_: How exactly they got a puppet with one of these past the radar, we'll never know, but a princess-puppet named Flora Follicle was wearing a dress with one of these, and yes, she had a noticeable crease in the middle of her chest.
-   In season 2 of _Babylon 5_, Delenn experiments by exchanging her usual robes for a slinky black dress with a diamond-shaped opening over her cleavage. Everyone who sees her is stunned speechless.
    -   The window is a not-uncommon part of Earth women's fashion — usually a high closed collar over a low neckline, creating the window. "Number One" (the head of the Mars Resistance) is one of the most notable bearers of such, wearing it in all her appearances.
-   _The Boys (2019)_. Starflight isn't happy when her corporate managers force her to wear a Hotter and Sexier superhero costume with this trope. At one point she has to cover her cleavage with her hand while bending down for a selfie with a little girl wearing her old costume, only to get Wolf Whistles and catcalls from the watching male fans. She tells the girl not to waste her money upgrading to the new version.
-   _Game of Thrones_: At least one of Daenerys' Meereenese gowns.
-   _Metal Hurlant Chronicles_: Kelly Brook's character Scarr in "Master of Destiny" is a space mercenary dressed in a leather catsuit with a boob window.
-   Ingrid the Snow Queen in _Once Upon a Time_ sports a big window in her sparkly white dress that doesn't leave much to the imagination.
-   Alexia from _Pixelface_ has a bodysuit with a pentagon-shaped cleavage cutout.
-   _A Series of Unfortunate Events (2017)_: Esmé Squalor features this while wearing a nurse's outfit in _The Hostile Hospital._
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   From _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ onward, the female Klingons are wearing outfits similar to their male counterparts, except with a cleavage-baring opening on the chest armor. Probably has something to do with the whole Space Viking motif. This is particularly silly, considering that Klingons attack each other with bladed weapons all the time. Even considering that Klingons have not one but **two** hearts.
-   Captain Liberty of _The Tick (2001)_ has a star-shaped cutout on the chest of her leotard. (As this shape produces unsupported upwards-pointing "spikes" of fabric, and spraying them with glue isn't sufficient to guarantee they won't come loose, the costumer opted to sew them to flesh-colored foam cleavage. The same is recommended for cosplayers.)
-   Pam from _True Blood_ frequently boosts her cleavage with a corset, but only when she's in action mode do we not see this vampire bartender presenting a cleavage window.

    Music 

-   Cathy Dennis wears several different colored catsuits in the video for "Touch Me (All Night Long)", each one with a circular-shaped cleavage window.

-   The picture<small>◊</small> for Fanservice Cover shows Kiera of _Jak and Daxter_ in a Sexy Santa Dress with a crop top that has an opening trimmed with fur that shows off her cleavage.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   WCW wrestler Mona used to wrestle in a mini dress with a triangle-shaped window.
-   Subverted by Daffney Unger, who had screens over her cleavage window outfits. _Tinted_ screens.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   Su Yung has worn a shirt with slits in it. Depending on how she moves and or the camera angle, her belly or her boobs become visible.
-   Subverted by Alexis Rose, who has a leotard with a stained glass window-type pattern cut out around her chest. But the snob wears a shirt underneath it, to deprive viewers of her cleavage.
-   Shazza McKenzie's "Supergirl" ring gear parodies Power Girl with a heart-shaped chest window that shows off pretty much everything _except_ McKenzie's cleavage.
-   Lady Frost's white fur gear has a cleavage window obscured by white paint, simulating...frost.

    Video Games 

-   Leslie's crop top in _Arc Rise Fantasia_ has multiple openings in the center, two of which show off her cleavage and Underboobs.
-   Bayonetta's default outfit has a large circular boob window. This is also where she wears her umbran watch.
-   Maya in _Borderlands 2_ has a small one. It's less noticeable than most on this list, partly because of her proportions and partly because of her default color scheme.
    -   Fiona from _Tales from the Borderlands_ has an opening in her shirt in the shape of a tie.
-   _Cho Aniki_ : The first time Benten showed her cleavage was in Ai Cho Aniki when she donned a leotard. She later gets a strapless leotard in _Zero_ that shows off more of the cleavage on her larger breasts as of that game.
-   Orlha in _Chrono Cross_ has mini dress with large diamond cutout in the center that shows off cleavage and some stomach.
-   In _Conduit 2_, Andromeda's full-body armor covers everything except her face and the tops of her breasts.
-   Hsien-Ko from _Darkstalkers_ wears an overtunic with a large oval-shaped chest opening.
-   Both the Vampire Armor and Royal Vampire Armor from _Dawnguard_ have cleavage windows that conveniently only exist when worn by female characters. The Royal Vampire Armor is a curious case, however; it _doesn't_ actually have a window. However, the suit includes a hooded cape which is secured at the throat, and this combined with the low-cut armor creates the impression of this trope.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   Morrigan's purple top combined with her thick layered necklace, in _Dragon Age: Origins,_ creates the image of a cleavage window.
        -   Some of the armor sets also provide these, especially the Chasind robes when worn by a female.
        -   A similar design is found in the _Awakening_ expansion, particularly on Velanna's starting outfit and the mage robes worn by The Baroness.
    -   The only thing that comes close to a cleavage window in _Dragon Age II_, on the other hand, is Varric's shirt. Varric is a male dwarf whose silk shirt has a plunging neckline to show off his Carpet of Virility. It's a minor Running Gag.
    -   Varric's neckline makes a return in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_. Meanwhile, Vivienne's non-combat outfit features a more traditional cleavage window, diamond-shaped.
-   Along with too many female characters to list, _Fate/Grand Order_ has a Rare Male Example from Odysseus.
-   With some exceptions, almost every "Harness"-type body armor in _Final Fantasy XI_ will have enclosing chest opening for both females _and_ males. The defensive value of a Cleavage Window is hotly contested.
-   Jihl Nabaat from _Final Fantasy XIII_ and _XIII-2_ has an impressive cleavage window to go with her Baroness and Hot Librarian look. It's also where adornments such as dolls get placed when she is recruited as a Mon in _XIII-2_. In the sequels, there's also Paddra Nsu-Yeul, who has an open slit on the front of her top running from her chest down to her stomach.
-   In _Fire Emblem Fates_, some of the _male_ characters' default outfits have this, especially the ninjas.
-   Exaggerated in _God of War III_ with Aphrodite. The dress she wears has an opening on the chest that exposes the entirety of both breasts.
-   In the character art and battle models for _Golden Sun: Dark Dawn_, Chalis's dress has a heart cutout over her navel. In her super-deformed noncombat model, the cutout is a little higher up.
-   Two Rare Male Examples in _I Was a Teenage Exocolonist_:
    -   Lum's shirt that has a low neckline and his metal collar that completely covers his neck and shoulders form a triangular hole that exposes his hairy pecs.
    -   Rex wears a shirt with a hole in the chest area as a teen.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_, Iza's small halter top like shirt has two fastened buttons that still leave a huge hole between buttons, revealing her cleavage. Her brother Coro also wears the same kind of shirt that also shows off a hole in his chest.
-   Jean Grey's Phoenix Five costume in _Marvel: Avengers Alliance_.
-   One of the default NPC outfits in _Mass Effect_ is a long dress with an enclosed oval-shaped chest area.
    -   Matriarch Benezia has an impressive one which the camera makes sure to give you a close-up of when she's first seen on screen.
-   In the first _Master of Orion_ game, the Mrrshan ambassador has an halterneck outfit with a large keyhole in the front.
-   In _Mortal Kombat 11_, Skarlet gets one of these as an alternate costume. Performing the gruesome Fatalities on her is the easiest way to notice that she was given<small>◊</small> a<small>◊</small> pretty<small>◊</small> impressive<small>◊</small> set<small>◊</small> of<small>◊</small> boobs.<small>◊</small>
-   _Neptunia_ has Neptune and Noire in their HDD forms wearing leotards with openings in the chest area.
    -   Cave from mk-2 has a Cleavage Window as well with her Deathsmiles-esque attire.
-   Inphyy's armor in _Ninety-Nine Nights_ has a opening in the chest area that shows off her cleavage
-   In _Ōkami_, the first form/clothing set of Wood Sprite Sakuya, who is a peach tree spirit, has _two_ Cleavage Windows. The first one is a diamond-shaped cutout showing off her cleavage. The second ones bares her buttocks, to go even further than the first one in using her figure to remind a viewer of her connection to peaches.
-   _Persona 5_: Ann Takamaki's Spy Catsuit has its zipper open from her collar bones to partway down her breasts, leaving a section of her bare chest visible.
-   Fina's dress in _Skies of Arcadia_ has a triangle-shaped cutout in the chest area. It also has the distinction of a purpose outside of fanservice: the exposed skin is where Fina's shard of the Silver Moon Crystal appears.
-   In _Sonic Heroes_, Rouge wears a bodysuit with an enclosed opening that shows off her cleavage.
-   Alicia Pris in _Tail Concerto_ wears a sleeveless crop-top shirt with a diamond-shaped hole in the middle, showing off her cleavage. _Solatorobo: Red the Hunter_ was going to give Alicia a new outfit, one that would connect her boob-window _to_ her exposed stomach, but that ended up getting scrapped for whatever reason.
-   Harold Berselius in _Tales of Destiny 2_ wears a jacket that sports a triangular one just over her corset.
-   Norma in _Tales of Legendia_ wears mini dress with a diamond-shaped cutout at the center. She's also the least-endowed of the _Legendia_ girls.
-   In _Tales of Symphonia_, _Martel_ has a triangle-shaped cleavage cutout in the flashback scenes, although it's hard to catch. It's a lot more noticeable in The Anime of the Game.
-   Cumore from _Tales of Vesperia_ is a Rare Male Example, being a foppish nobleman with a heart-shaped in his clothes over his pecs.
-   _World of Warcraft_ features several chest armors for females with a Cleavage Window. One example is the Riverblade Armor set<small>◊</small>.
-   Yisha Tarren of _X: Rebirth_ in a gross violation of common sense, has a boob window on what appears to be her Latex Space Suit. Amusingly, one of the _very first_ Game Mods to be released patched up the hole.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_ has several sets of armor, with various holes cut over the cleavage, for Sharla, Melia, and Fiora.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_: Both Ethel and Eunie show quite a bit of cleavage for people from a society with no concept of sex or physical attraction. However, they both have their life tattoos on their cleavage; it seems they picked their clothes simply to display their tattoos.

    Visual Novels 

-   There are two examples in _The Cradle of Ruin_. Megi’s top is a little revealing depending on the angle. Angelica’s dress has a far more revealing as the front portion shows her cleavage in full view. Demonica’s dress is the same as Angelica’s except in black.
-   Saber's dress in _Fate/stay night_ has opening in the chest area, though strictly speaking there's not really any cleavage to emphasize.
    -   Also it should be noted whenever she goes into battle, her window is covered up by a large chestplate. And her normal civilian dress has no window.
-   In _Virtue's Last Reward_, all Alice wears above her waist is an open jacket and a large Egyptian necklace. The important bits stay covered no matter what, but her cleavage remains on full display. And in several routes, she ends up getting fatally stabbed through the heart.

    Web Animation 

-   Virtual YouTuber Kaguya Luna sports this as part of her appeal. Humorously, she references this fact in one video where she states her distaste towards being called "Chestbutt".
-   _RWBY_:
    -   Yang creates this effect by layering clothes. Her scarf and top expose the top half of her breasts while covering up the top half of her chest and neck.
    -   Glynda Goodwitch has a centralised oval-shaped hole in her blouse that is enclosed by the very high collar that she wears.
    -   Nora has a little heart-shaped hole just above her chest. After the Time Skip, it appears to have gained rips.
    -   All of the main girls have this post-Time Skip: Ruby has a blouse with a hole that would be large enough to completely expose her breasts were it not covered by her corset, Weiss has a cardigan over a sweetheart neckline dress, Blake has a crop top with multiple diamond-shaped holes in a pattern over the chest, and Yang has a setup similar to her old outfit, but smaller and with her jacket's weird round collar instead of a scarf.
    -   Emerald wears a white top with an entirely cut-out front over a green strapless top that prevents her breasts from being _fully_ exposed.
    -   Salem wears a black robe that exposes her cleavage.

    Webcomics 

-   Lust from _180 Angel_ has one of these in his shirt, in a Rare Male Example. Justified, as he is the personification of well, _lust_.
-   Crossroads from _Antihero for Hire_ wore a bodysuit that had as cross-shaped cutout in the chest area early appearances. Luckily, she realized how ridiculous that costume looked, so she changed it.
-   Discussed but averted in _Dumbing of Age_ with self-appointed superheroine Amazi-Girl. To Daisy's displeasure.
-   In _Ears for Elves_, one of the High Elves of Kenn'iraheal wears a long dress with a small keyhole in the front.
-   Done less than subtly with a generic superhero wearing Power Girl's outfit in _El Goonish Shive_. Hero, mind you, not heroine.
-   Both Golden Jane and Iron Jane of the Jane Gang from _Everyday Heroes_ wear leotards with teardrop-shaped cutouts above their cleavage.
-   _Girl Genius_:
-   In _Grrl Power_, Halo warns Heavenly Sword that she'll be tagged as "Keyhole" if she doesn't introduce herself properly during her first appearance (even though it's a fight scene).
-   Taken to absurd extremes in one _Hark! A Vagrant_ comic in which it discusses the impracticality of Dagger's costume (which falls more under Navel-Deep Neckline), and culminates in Dagger asking Marvel if she could wear a sweater instead. They send her one....with front completely cut out so they could still see her breasts.
-   _Heroine Chic_ follows the adventures of Zoe Porter, who designs costumes for superheroes. Her best friend and roommate Laren has a part-time gig as a sidekick called "Liberteen" that sees her wearing a patriotic red-white-and-blue costume featuring a cleavage window. This is especially glaring because the rest of the costume is made of stab-proof, nigh-bulletproof material, and Laren doesn't even have superpowers to protect herself — she's just a Pilates instructor who took a few martial arts classes and picked up the sidekick gig to make some extra cash. The first thing Zoe does when she redesigns the costume is to get rid of the cleavage.
-   _Oglaf_ has this with the strip _Oriel_ where the window itself is an Eldritch Abomination as even a Beholder is caught staring. Stare at your peril.
    -   The epilogue to _Oriel_ sees the woman from that strip meet another woman who also as a chest window abomination. When the two stare at each other it forms a Droste Image of windows that hypnotises both of them.
-   In a _Pixie Trix Comix_ sequence set at a swimwear/pinup photo-shoot where everybody else seems to be wearing Barely-There Swimwear, Zadie feels _overdressed_ in a sundress with a cleavage window. As this strip shows, the scene also features the voluptuous FiFi in a flashy bikini-and-top ensemble that creates a sort-of cleavage window effect.
-   _Sandra on the Rocks_ is a comedy about the fashion business, so it's not surprising if this feature is present on some of the flashier outfits seen in the comic — notably on Zoé's clubbing outfit here. Which may be a little unwise of her, given that she usually opts for "stylish", and this dress reminds us that she's got quite a bit of cleavage to show.
-   _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_: "Genius": A superheroine gets one after going to the tailor and saying, "I have to fight villains all day, but I remain interested in attracting uncomplicated casual encounters."
-   _Spinnerette_:
    -   Lampshaded when discussing the design of Spinnerette's new suit, here.
        
        **Spinnerette:** \[...\] If you could just give it a lower neckline with some cleavage\[...\]  
        **Sahira:** What?  
        **Spinnerette:** Y'know. To distract the bad guys.  
        **Sahira:** You have a bullet-proof fabric, and you want to cut a hole in it right over your heart?! Are you insane?
        
    -   Super MILF used to have one as her previously costume was a rip off of Power Girl. She apparently justifies this in that her "venusian bust" generates so much heat that she requires air venting. At least, that's what she says, though she also openly makes her opinion clear that the majority of costumed vigilantes do what they do mostly for sexual thrills, so...
        -   It has since been shown that it generates enough heat that people standing close to her can feel it. Dressing modestly would at the very least be highly uncomfortable. Of course, that doesn't mean that she has to use a Cleavage Window. She currently has an Impossibly-Low Neckline instead.
    -   Much later, when Spinnerettes based on different comic book eras start appearing in the main universe, 90's Spinnerette appears with this trope in full force, combining it with Navel-Deep Neckline and Leotard of Power.
-   In _SwordCat Princess_, Kathryn's SwordCat Princess costume, from her '90s Image Comics-y superheroing days, features a large cleavage window (made out of the same style of Omega she uses in her Artemis armor belt buckle).
-   _What's Shakin'_: Ms. Apple's robe has an aptly cut shape above her chest.

-   Crimson, who is at the Superhero School Whateley Academy in the _Whateley Universe_. She has a diamond-shaped window large enough that Phase thinks she's risking a wardrobe malfunction.

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_: Francine ice dance dress in the episode "Of Ice and Men" has an heart-shaped opening in the chest area.
-   Ice in _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_ has a triangle-shaped cleavage cutout on her costume.
-   The _Futurama_ DVD commentaries mention that the animators liked putting Leela and Amy in dresses with these whenever the plot required them to dress up. Lampshaded in one episode that had random time skips during a basketball game. Amy, wearing such an outfit, immediately brings attention to it as a possible explanation.
    -   In "The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings," Leela wears a long formal dress with a keyhole in the chest to Fry's opera.
    -   The female version of Bender in "Neutopia."
-   _Justice League Unlimited_:
    -   Galatea has an oval-shaped opening on her white leotard, as she's basically an evil Expy of Power Girl.
    -   Ice sports a triangular one.
    -   Volcana's new outfit included a tank top with one in it.
-   _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_ has a few examples, but between the art style and the intended audience they don’t technically show anything. Character designer Rae Geiger is in record as saying they can express someone’s character without having to be fanservice.
    -   Sea Hawk is a male example, with a low-cut keyhole neckline befitting a dashing, swashbuckling sailor (according to himself, anyways).
    -   Wrench Wench Entrapta has one created by a combination of an undershirt worn under a set of one-piece arm covers. It’s such an integral part of her character design that the space suit she builds in Season 5 has a transparent section in the same spot.
    -   After scheming and fighting her way into co-rulership of the Horde, Catra gets an Evil(er) Costume Switch that features a diamond-shaped one. She keeps the window along with most of the outfit after doing a Heel–Face Turn.
    -   Double Trouble’s outfit has a bifurcated version, along with various other cutouts. In this case, it accentuates that they’re a mischievous, slinking shapeshifter with an amoral streak a mile wide.
    -   "Kyle", an otherwise unnamed resident of the Crimson Waste who Catra briefly bullies into being a henchman (and named after a Butt-Monkey she knows), also has one.
-   In _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_, Ahsoka's outfit after the Time Skip in the third season is a backless mini dress with a small opening in the chest area. In the first 2.5 seasons it's an outright Age Inappropriate tube top, though.
-   On _Steven Universe,_ Sugilite doesn't really have cleavage, but has a hole in her outfit to show off Amethyst's Gem in her chest. Eventually, Amethyst herself switches from a tank top with a loose, low neck to one with a similar opening and higher neckline.
-   In Stan Lee's _Stripperella_ the title character changes her costume midway through the series. It looks similar to her old costume, the difference being her long sleeved crop top has a huge enclosed diamond-shaped cutout.
-   Izzy from _Total Drama_ has one in her signature outfit. The top is a crop top with triangle-shaped keyhole. In the second aftermath of _Action_, she uses hers to hold grapes, cheese and crackers, as well as the crumbs she spit out after realizing she was on the green room's TV.

    Real Life 

-   There are probably plenty of these at model shoots and show business events, but such an outfit can be very — _notable_ anywhere else. In May 2012, a model named Julia Orayén was hired to present some materials to the candidates at the start of a Mexican presidential debate. On camera for less than 30 seconds, her tight dress with a large keyhole was an instant Twitter sensation, and news reports worldwide declared how she had upstaged — or even "won" — the debate.
-   A more mundane version is usually achieved by wearing a cardigan with only the top button fastened over an outfit that shows cleavage.
-   The Japanese fashion company COMFILAX created a turtleneck with a cleavage window in late 2014. After famous Japanese cosplayer Myako took a picture of herself wearing one, a meme started of drawing characters wearing that sweater due to the inherent sexiness of this trope, the Sexy Sweater Girl, and the impracticality of exposing your breasts to the cold.
-   Minoan <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  feminine fashion, or at least either their priestesses or representations of their goddess(es), combined long, flaring, dresses with exposed breasts.
