A Robot Buddy who happens to be made out of light.

Holography is the very real technique of using lasers to create a three dimensional image. It's very difficult and requires precisely calculated conditions and a bunch of costly hardware, but it's visually stunning, at least the first few times you see one. Technically, what is popularly called a "hologram" in science fiction is really called a volumetric display, as a true hologram is recorded onto a visual medium that provides the illusion of volume.

In The Future, presumably, this will get a lot easier. The Projected Man allows an artificial character to be a ridiculously human robot without all the logistical problems that implies.

The character may be constrained by power or the availability of a projector to add flavor.

Can be made of Hard Light, or can be an Intangible Man. Generally, if the Projected Man is solid, he will be able to become intangible in a crisis.

Frequently coupled with Tin Man or Mission Control. The inverse (human projection inside a computer world) is the Digital Avatar. Compare Astral Projection, where a living person makes their soul similar to this.

Cross with Spirit Advisor to produce Virtual Ghost. See also Hologram Projection Imperfection for when holograms don't work properly and have visual static or other glitches.

The name comes from the British science fiction movie, _The Projected Man_, that was riffed on _MST3K_. The eponymous character was more like a mutated freak with electricity powers than an example of this trope.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Masha, the Robot Buddy in _Tokyo Mew Mew_, can project a hologram of Ryou, his Teen Genius creator, when the latter needs to tell something to the girls and can't be there himself.
-   In _The Mysterious Cities of Gold_ from the second season onward, the six Sages of Mu and Princess Rana'Ori appear as "lumino-projections" in some of the Cities of Gold. At one point in the final season, Ambrosius also makes a holographic message of himself as part of a trap.
-   Reinforce Zwei was depicted as this in the Distant Finale of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_. She's become a lot more solid since.
-   Canal in _Lost Universe_ is a Spaceship Girl in a Meido outfit. Notably, this is supposed to be impossible, even for the advanced space-faring races of the world in question. It's implied that Canal is only able to exist this way due to being an avatar of the Big Good, Volfied.
-   _Blassreiter_ has Elea, a quirky AI who projects herself as a sexy imp. The epilogue introduces her successor, Maria.
-   The move Double Team is depicted this way in _Pokémon: The Series_.
-   _Transformers: Robots in Disguise_: T-AI, an Autobot-aligned supercomputer, manifests herself in the holographic form of a Japanese policewoman.
-   The Duel arenas in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ use 3D holography to project realistic depictions of whatever is summoned by a particular card.

    Comic Books 

-   When robotic superheroes get heavily damaged (and they frequently do) they will often be projected until repairs to their bodies are completed. Examples include:
    -   Red Tornado (DC Comics)
    -   The Vision (Marvel Comics), who also changes his density anyway as a superpower.
    -   _Green Lantern_ Stel does this too.
-   Miguel O'Hara, the Spider Man of 2099, had a personalized AI assistant who went by Lyla, and projected a Marilyn Monroe-like figure to communicate with him. She could take other forms, including an obvious lookalike of Aunt May.
-   The mutant who uses the nickname Blue has an area of cyberspace mapped out like TRON, and there he has his own Projected Man 'Clu'. The name "Clu" may itself be a Shout-Out to a minor character from _Tron_.
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_, NICOLE appears as a lynx using this trope.
-   In _All Fall Down_, AIQ Squared appears as this.
-   Luther Ironheart, the robotic deputy in _American Flagg!_, is something of a hybrid. He has a large human-shaped but clearly robotic body, and a hologram for a head. While his head usually appears as a friendly and obviously non-human cartoon image, he can also use it to impersonate other characters. He successfully impersonates Flagg at one point, and the image is apparently flawless, at least on a video screen.
-   The villain Optilux from Alan Moore's _Supreme_ run was an alien intelligence (and Brainiac Expy) who existed as a living hologram. He also converted whole cities into light constructs and imprisoned them in prism-like structures (parallelling Brainiac shrinking cities and imprisoning them in bottles), believing that he was fulfilling a higher purpose by converting living people into light.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Some have Superman's father Jor-El as a hologram who can walk around but he's usually portrayed as a Huge Holographic Head like in the movies.
    -   In _Strangers at the Heart's Core_, the alien criminal trio known as The Visitors build a device called "The Voodoo Machine" which can project images capable of interacting with people and physical objects.

    Fan Works 

-   The _Portal 2_ fanfic _Blue Sky_ has Wheatley transferred into a Hard Light body. It's so realistic that several characters don't even realize he's not human - at one point, he shows a plug in the back of his neck to the local technology expert, and the other character is so stunned he decides he needs a drink before the conversation can continue.
-   The HoloSmurf seen in a few stories in the Smurfed Behind saga of the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story series.
-   In _Voice of the Condor_, Muran'Kel, Esteban's dead mother normally appears as a glowing blue hologram, but her mental link to the Cities of Gold allows her to build a solid body out of the orichalcum sand in Kumlar. She also helps Cibola, the Golden Condor's AI, gain a projected human avatar toward the climax.
-   At the end of _Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space_, Captain Proton realises that the President of Earth is actually just a Digital Avatar of the Great Calculator that truly runs society. This is a Mythology Gag to _The Adventures of Captain Proton_ where the President of Earth is played by Voyager's Emergency Medical Hologram.

    Films — Animated 

-   On _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2_, Chester V has holographic clones of himself that make public appearances for him and also serve as his companions. In the climax, they try to save him from fallling into his own machine, but as they are not made of Hard Light...

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _I, Robot_ featured V.I.K.I, the AI/Positronic brain of USR, who usually appeared as a face in a cube, made by smaller cubes.
    -   And before that, when Del Spooner first arrives at USR, he interacts with a projected recording of Alfred Lanning, who is capable of answering simple questions.
        -   Unlike VIKI's face, Lanning's recording is two-dimensional, although it appears volumetric from the front.
-   Vox, Orlando Jones' virtual-librarian character in _The Time Machine (2002)_. Uniquely, Vox doesn't "exist" in real space, but interacts with people through transparent "pillars." Also, Vox changes quite a bit. During Hartdegen's first stop in the future, Vox is a chic, acerbic 21st Century man; his appearance and movement are smooth and crystal-clear. By 802701, he looks visibly older (requiring glasses) and has significant Hologram Projection Imperfection. This is justified, as he's running on reserve power. He's neither as smooth nor as acerbic as he was; now, he's a little more jittery and a lot more haunted. In his words, "Can you even _imagine_ what it's like to remember...everything?"
-   In 1995's _Hologram Man_ Kurt Decoda and Norman Galagher are transformed into holographic parolees in a Demolition Man\-esque universe with Domed Cities.
-   Joi in _Blade Runner 2049_. Initially, she only appears thanks to a projection system in K's apartment, but then he buys an emanator that allows her to appear anywhere.

    Literature 

-   Both H.I.V.E.mind and Overlord of the _H.I.V.E. Series_ appear as floating holographic heads.
-   A future human society in Stephen Baxter's _Manifold: Space_ makes use of "limited-sentience projections" as messengers. Initially Nemoto appears several times via more ordinary holographic telepresence (it's really her, talking as if over the phone), making for an unexpected What Measure Is a Non-Human? moment much further into the future when another character asks the projection what exactly it is; Virtual Nemoto explains and then looks horrified before dissolving into light. (And you thought Star Trek holograms had it bad...)
    -   _Andromeda_ appears to have borrowed the concept, as in at least one instance, a message is sent in the form of an interactive holographic recreation of the sender.
-   Alfred Bester's _The Computer Connection_ apparently used this technique to replace both telephones (called "projecting") and advertising. The latter reversed the traditional payment scheme of advertising in that consumers could pay a monthly fee to maintain the insulation in their homes to keep the advertising _out_.
-   Subverted in _Revelation Space_ by Alastair Reynolds, when one character is being rude to what she thinks is a holographic avatar, only to find it's a real person she's talking to. "We used to use avatars, but they put up with too much crap". Later in the series, Captain John Armstrong Brannigan, a Trans Human, manifests himself in the form of decaying servitors, but viewer uses augmented reality goggles to see him as he was six hundred years ago when he worked for an organization called "NASA".
-   The _Skylark Series_ by E. E. "Doc" Smith has the Hard Light version of this, and may well be the Ur-Example.
-   Jane, from _Speaker for the Dead_ and its sequels, started out as an extremely complex game/psychology test, but eventually developed sentience, and chose a young woman as her preferred avatar. Although holographic displays are standard for personal computers in this universe, the displays can only project holograms in a limited range above themselves.
-   _The Sun Eater_ series by Christopher Ruocchio has the main hero Hadrian understand a passage from their sacred histories "...and the daughters of Columbia seduced the kings of the Earth". Columbia is the first American A.I. and her daughters are next generation A.I. To help sell other countries's governments on the adoption of A.I., these next-gen machines had holographic avatars of flawlessly beautiful naked women made of white light who offered gifts of more advanced technology and seamlessly efficient government.
-   Colin from William Gibson's _Mona Lisa Overdrive_ manifests this way.
-   _Wayfarer_ by Dennis Schmidt has a scene where the main character manages to get aboard a ship still orbiting the planet and meets a holographic projection of the colony fleet's (now long-dead) admiral. The computer running it is programmed with enough of the admiral's knowledge and personality that the simulation could actually exercise a limited degree of command in _routine_ matters; this allows it to give the hero some useful advice based on the real admiral's mastery of Zen.
-   The DHI's from _Kingdom Keepers_ become this upon sleeping, taking over for the hologram versions of themselves that serve as hosts in the parks. Finn has also shown the ability to briefly become one at will, complete with Intangible Man properties.
-   OWEN from _The Municipalists_ has his physical appearance generated by a projector disguised in Henry's tie clip.
-   _N.E.R.D.S._: The Playground's AI assistant, Benjamin, is a floating orb that projects itself as a hologram of historical figure Benjamin Franklin.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The titular character of _Automan_. The difference with him is that with enough power, Automan is able to have a physical presence in the real world that feels real and can interact with physical objects as if he is.
-   _Halo (2022)_, like the games, has the AI Cortana, albeit now she looks more human-like, starting with being flesh-colored instead of blue (the producers said that even if Cortana is a hologram, she had to feel real standing next to actual human beings).
-   Rimmer in _Red Dwarf_, although he very definitely did not fit the mold of Robot Buddy.
    -   Holograms in this franchise are Virtual Ghosts of Brain Uploaded crew members but due to the high energy costs, most ships can only generate one hologram at a time so they have to hope that nobody more important dies.
    -   It was originally shown that Rimmer couldn't leave the ship without being contained inside a holographic projection cage but later episodes scrapped this and said he was maintained by a tiny, hovering "light bee" inside himself and could go wherever he wanted.
    -   Holograms were specified from the start to be intangible but the writers kept forgetting this and had Rimmer lifting things. In "Legion", he was eventually given a Hard Light drive that made him solid and indestructible.
    -   "Holoship" introduced the titular project starship, crewed by hundreds of holograms.
-   Darien's sidekick S.E.L.M.A. (Specified Encapsulated Limitless Memory Archive) in _Time Trax_. She is almost a Virtual Ghost, as her appearance was based on a photograph of Darien's late mother. For Darien's mission into the 20th century, S.E.L.M.A. is disguised as a credit card and frequently used as such (she just hacks the computer to accept her). In one episode, Darien meets an old friend of his, who has traveled back in time to catch a certain criminal. He shows off his own computer called C.I.N.D.I. (Consumer Information Network and Data Interface), who looks like a ditzy blonde and doesn't do much except giggle and take up seductive poses, while her hologram occasionally glitches. Obviously an inferior version of S.E.L.M.A., who is a little insulted.
-   _Star Trek_
    -   Any humanoid-like being produced by the Holodeck qualifies, although most don't seem to be sentient.
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: A noteworthy mention is Stephen Hawking who, as a hologram, got to be the only person in the franchise's history to date to appear on the show as himself.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_: The Doctor, a.k.a. the Emergency Medical Hologram, is the chief medical officer on _Voyager_.
    -   _Star Trek: Picard_:
        -   Index, a hologram with the appearance of a human woman, is the user-friendly directory at Starfleet Archives.
        -   _La Sirena_ has at least five emergency holograms (Medical, Navigational, Hospitality, Tactical and Engineering). They all look like Cristóbal Rios, the ship's owner, because he selected the self-scan option, but they all dress, talk and act differently.
-   One of Andromeda's three selves in _Andromeda_. One episode, which revealed that Gaheris Rhade killed Dylan in the original timeline and took his place as the re-creator of the Commonwealth, had Rhade create a hologram of Dylan, mostly as someone to play Go with, but also providing sage advice during crises. It's partly the hologram that makes Rhade realize that Dylan would do this job far better than he, so he goes back in time and throws the fight, allowing himself to be killed.
-   Used by _Mission: Impossible_ in a few of their conjobs, particularly notable in the episode _Holograms_.
-   Caravaggio from _Starhunter_. From the shoulders up, he's a posh British butler in a tuxedo, from back when the ship had been a luxury liner. From the shoulders down, he's a skeleton because his image files had degraded.
-   Al from _Quantum Leap_ isn't actually a hologram, but functions like one from Sam's point of view.
    -   However, Sam and the world around him, appear as this to Al back in the present because he is in an "imaging chamber" much like a Star Trek Holodeck.
-   Similarly, Asgard communications technology in _Stargate SG-1_ functions by projecting a full-body hologram of the user to wherever the person they want to talk to is, apparently without the need for an emitter at the recieving end, allowing for some handy Intangible Man shenanigans.
    -   The Ancients have this as well.
    -   An interesting variation on this is used in an early episode by Sokar, who attacks the Earth gate's iris with a particle accelerator. He modulates the accelerator to make his face appear on the iris and even have his voice come out, informing the Tau'ri why he's punishing them.
    -   The Asgard holo-technology is revealed to the public in one episode as a counter to a CEO revealing an Asgard as proof that the government is hiding something (it was just a mindless clone). Carter then went on national television and revealed that the government has been working on realistic-looking holographic projection technology and demonstrates this by passing her hand through a solid object, revealing that she wasn't really there. The reporter interviewing her calls bullshit on that, claiming that she has never heard of a technology like that before.
    -   A crossover SG-1/Atlantis episode involves Daniel searching through the Ancient database in Atlantis for Merlin's weapon, finally figuring out that his holographic guide is actually Ganos Lal (AKA Morgan Le Fay), an Ascended Ancient, secretly helping him.
-   Several characters on _Babylon 5_ are able to communicate this way while making use of the Great Machine. Two out of three characters who do this on the show tend to be Large Hams for some reason.
-   "The Professor," the holographic advisor system installed in the captain's cabin aboard SeaQuest DSV. Notable for including several Real Life limitations: it couldn't travel (the image was projected on a fog "screen"), it wasn't tangible, it couldn't repair itself (either hardware or software), and it frequently suffered from Hologram Projection Imperfection.
-   Cyber-Cam from _Power Rangers Ninja Storm_, who regular Cam created to handle some of his responsibilities when he became the Sixth Ranger and found that managing that _and_ being the Mission Control was too exhausting.
-   Gideon in _The Flash (2014)_, an AI from the future (with Morena Baccarin's voice) that keeps track of Barry's future for Dr. Wells, AKA the Reverse-Flash. As Barry finds out, Gideon is the creation of his future self.
    -   _Legends of Tomorrow_ reveals that the Time Masters have adapted the technology to creating multiple Gideon-like AIs, one of which is also named Gideon, but has a difference voice. These tend to only project their heads, although they have much more developed personalities.

    Theater 

-   The Squip from _Be More Chill_ manifests for the user as a holographic human form, defaulting to Keanu Reeves. It has no real physical presence, unless Rule of Funny dictates otherwise (like zapping the lock off a locker). It also seems physical to users, possibly creating the illusion of touch by manipulating the user's nervous system.

    Video Games 

-   _Azure Striker Gunvolt:_ In the second game onward, Copen is accompanied by a Robot Buddy called Lola, who can project a humanoid female form of herself. Played with in that it's not an inherent feature, but she gets it from analyzing the power of "The Muse" Septima, which lets the user holographically project their consciousness as an Idol Singer.
-   _Beyond Good & Evil_ has Secundo, an Ambiguously Spanish holographic AI who manages Jade's inventory and e-mail for her. He's also a Chekhov's Gunman, as his short on-screen appearance at the beginning of the game only hints at the fact that his computerized nature will prove very helpful at the game's end.
-   _Defiance_: Your EGO implant projects a blue flickering light lady into you field of vision to make the interface feel more natural.
-   In _Destroy All Humans!_, Pox becomes this when he downloads his conscious into a float disk just before their main ship was destroyed. He stays this way for a decade before finally getting himself a new body, though not what he expected.
-   _Deus Ex: Invisible War_ has NG Resonance, an international pop-star, whose holographic AIs are playing all over the world. The AIs can interact with people, and one is hard-pressed to tell that it's not an actual person. Interestingly, while the holograms are polite and friendly, the actual pop-star is a spoiled brat who doesn't care about anyone.
    -   Expanding on this, the AI starts to become personalized towards each person. You see it giving advice and comforting an office drone the first time you met it. As the game goes on it starts acting as your handler, which you can comment on. And to be fair to the Pop-Star she was panicking as she found herself in the middle of a war-zone.
-   Eliza of _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_ is a life-like hologram.
-   Layla, the girl in the Sunset Cage in _Fairune 2_ looks like just another Mysterious Waif up until she suddenly flickers and shuts down. She gets better.
-   The _Fallout: New Vegas_ expansion _Dead Money_ has the holographic security system of the Sierra Madre hotel and casino. The holograms themselves cannot be damaged, but are capable of emitting lethal lasers, so the only way to deal with them is to hack the security system, find and destroy their projector, or run out of range. What's unsettling is that some of them are based on recordings of the casino's patrons' last moments after the bombs fell and everyone was sealed inside, so such holograms will be talking in a panicked voice to long-dead victims as they go about their patrol routes and shoot at intruders. Some bad endings for the DLC describe how the Courier becomes another flickering ghost to haunt the ruins.
-   In _Halo_, almost all human-made AIs use a holographic human avatar:
    -   Cortana, a "naked blue lady" who's also Chief's Voice with an Internet Connection and Mission Control, with a good bit of Playful Hacker thrown in. That said, she's often stuck in Chief's helmet, which doesn't really have a projection system. In _Halo 4_, she's able to briefly manifest herself with Hard Light by using the technology on a Forerunner ship. In _Halo 5: Guardians_, she seems to have created a full hard-light body for herself.
    -   Others examples of AIs with human avatars include Serina of the UNSC _Spirit of Fire_ (from _Halo Wars_) and Roland of the UNSC _Infinity_ (introduced in _Halo 4_).
    -   One unusual example is Black Box (or BB for short), originally introduced in _Halo: Glasslands_. One of the most advanced AIs in the UNSC, he takes pride in his superiority by refusing to generate a human avatar, always appearing instead as little more than a featureless blue cube that nevertheless manages to convey emotion by spinning and running lights over itself.
-   _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_ has the G0-T0 droid who hides behind his Secret Identity of Goto, a middle aged man communicating only through hologram projection.
-   In _System Shock 2_, the _Von Braun's_ Recreation deck includes a brothel called the "Sensual Sim Center", where patrons can make out with holographic performers of both sexes. All the holograms are busted when you get there, though.
-   Nearly every Virtual Intelligence encountered in the game _Mass Effect_ is a perfect example of this trope. The one exception is the rogue VI found on Earth's moon. Its rogue status may or may not have something to do with this.
    -   These are actually special cases: when a VI is designed for interpersonal interaction (such as Avina, the asari VI on the Citadel) it has a human- or asari-shaped projection. There's actually a VI interface in almost everything, from your omnitool to your biotic implant to your assault rifle. The rogue VI on the moon didn't have a projection because it was designed for organising drones for combat simulations, not for directing people to the nearest bar or restaurant.
    -   EDI in the second game inverts this in that she projects herself as a sphere of blue lights, but is a genuine self-aware AI.
    -   Glyph similarly manifests as a blue sphere, although in his case he is a drone equipped as a sort of administrative assistant VI.
    -   Holographic projections are also commonly used for long distance communication, at least for folks important enough to make direct calls to Commander Shepard, a list that is generally limited to leaders or representatives of powerful organizations.
    -   In the third game, it is possible to encounter a VI with a very Flanderized version of Commander Shepard's personality, which projects itself as a hard-light projection of Shepard. Depending on if Shepard is a Paragon or a Renegade, the VI will either be obnoxiously supportive or comically bloodthirsty. Cue Do I Really Sound Like That? from Shepard.
-   In _The Suffering_, Dr. Killjoy is the ghost of a deranged psychiatrist who manifests from old film projectors. Much creepiness ensues, including having to destroy the projectors to stop him from reviving certain enemies.
-   _Uru: Ages Beyond Myst_ has one. Yeesha built a small imager in the Cleft that can project a full 3D hologram of herself, sound and all, and in one recording, _a Linking Book even works while still part of the hologram_. Somewhat justified, as holography is nothing new to the D'ni civilization, though their imagers more often use 2D holograms.
-   _XCOM 2_ has the Codex enemy, a flickering female figure that your head scientist speculates to be merely the projection of some sort of multidimensional being. They can teleport at will and clone themselves when they take damage, but are solid enough to shoot and will take advantage of cover.

    Visual Novels 

-   Sora in _Ever17_ is an AI who appears to be a 24-year-old woman but is actually seen by other characters via a series of light projections embedded into the walls of the underwater complex into their eyes. As her programming gets unshackled, she starts to ponder her existence during some down times, reflecting that unlike the other characters stuck underwater she can't actually touch them. She gets an android body in the True Ending and becomes a Robot Girl.

    Webcomics 

-   The Artificial Intelligences that control ships in the _Schlock Mercenary_ universe are usually represented by holograms, for interaction with "meatbags". And for the sake of exposition, as they themselves occasionally notice, even for direct interaction between AIs themselves. Some exceptions are Haban, who is embedded into a human and talks through him, Ennesby, who has a physical flying body and was talking through it or just speakers when he was a ship AI, and TAG, who speaks disembodiedly on purpose.
-   "Station", the Spaceship Boy in _Questionable Content_ who controls the Ellicott Chatham Enterprises Space Station, interacts with humans through a holographic projection of a young man, which it can manifest anywhere within the Station or via remote drone elsewhere. Played for Laughs when people forget that he's not made of Hard Light, when he glitches out while "hung over" from modeling weather patterns, and when he stages paranormal activity.
    -   May is a personal AI assistant projected through Dale's Augmented Reality Glasses (who, as a result, only he can see). She has her own robot chassis, but it's locked up in Robot Jail at the time (she tried to upload herself into a fighter jet) and she's essentially doing community service. Later on, she shows up "in the flesh".
-   In _Leaving the Cradle_, Quantum, the residential Artificial Intelligence appears as this to those speaking with them. Athough his appearance appears to be based on one of the aliens of the setting, the character page says that he has no actual self-image and chooses the form that's being the most convenient for the other speaker.
-   _Serix_: Seen all over the place, and a good amount of people in the setting exist mainly or solely in this form.
-   In _S.S.D.D._ most A.I.s that aren't housed in a mobile robot frame have a "blobby" holographic avatar designed not to look like any particular species, the Oracle's avatar is a blue cloudy sphere containing three triangles that look like eyes and a nose for instance. Though in their simulations, which most organics can't access, they tend to have more anthropomorphic avatars modeled after the Oracle's creator in his case.

    Web Original 

-   All the A.I.s in _Red vs. Blue_ project themselves in this manner at some point, with Delta notably using his projection to simulate a combatant in battle as a distraction once. In _Reconstruction_, the "ghost" form of Church is revealed to be one of these, blurring the lines between projection and self.
-   It's revealed in the Season Five Wham Episode of _Puppet History_ that the Professor who supposedly Came Back Wrong is actually an Evil Counterpart named Concupiscence, who was a hologram made to entertain purgatory that was brought back to reality. He's only halfway to being corporeal and is willing to skin Ryan alive and wear his flesh to Become a Real Boy.

    Western Animation 

-   Subverted in _Futurama_, where a miniature Projected Man version of Hermes appears to the other characters to relay a message but is then carried away by a pigeon. When the (real) Hermes appears next, he is sporting various plasters.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   Slight twist: In some continuities, there are holograms of drivers in their vehicle modes so that they don't appear to be driving themselves. In one comic series, the driver avatars are Hard Light projections that can operate some distance from their robot bodies.
    -   Sixshot in _Transformers: ★Headmasters_ projects copies of himself to fight; they're made of Hard Light. Prowl in _Transformers: Animated_ seems to have picked up a similar trick, but without the hardness (and a crimefighter in the comic named "Wraith" is able to project a moving hologram of himself that he controls from a nearby truck).
    -   In _Transformers: Robots in Disguise_, T-AI is a sentient computer who projects a holographic image of herself. She even operates equally holographic keypads to make the computer (which is _her_) do stuff. Transformers Wiki summed up the Fridge Logic of this. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> The Rule of Cool is definitely in effect.
-   In later episodes of _Danny Phantom_ we see that Vlad made himself a holographic version of Danny's mother as his lab assistant. When Danny attacks his laboratory, the hologram and the AI glitches says it prefers to be with the holographic Jack Fenton than with him. He later fixes that "flaw".
    -   In "Phantom Planet" it turns out he's using at least two holographic Maddies on his space station and at one point they fight over who's the favorite.
-   Hugo<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>  from _Get Ace_, who takes on the appearance and personality of The Jeeves and allows Ace to easily access the various functions of his spy braces via verbal commands. Only Ace can see him due to wearing special glasses.
-   Synergy from _Jem_.
    -   Jem herself doesn't count since it's more of We Will Not Use Stage Make-Up in the Future, but Jerrica has had Synergy project holograms of Jem (or holograms of Jerrica if she's in her Jem alter-ego) to prevent her cover from being blown when the need for both of them to be in the same room at the same time arises.
-   The second season of _Iron Man: The Animated Series_ featured an AI called HOMER. Unlike his comic book incarnation, who only appeared as a voice from the computers that ran Tony's armor-manufacturing facilities (with... this... representing his "face"), the cartoon portrayed him as a Projected Man.
