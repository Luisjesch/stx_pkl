_"If you live like a villain all your life, sooner or later you will be 60 and still being shot at."_

Next time Mr. Jenkins next door yells at you to get off his lawn, you might want to listen — he might be hiding a death laser under his rocking chair.

Some people grow old gracefully, and sit back to enjoy the last few years of their life. Others want to spend their final days as the supreme ruler of all humanity. Not all senior citizens can be kind, loving grandparents. Some are just as evil in their old age as they were in their youth, and still want to destroy everything, conquer the world, or generally be evil. They can, however, put a façade of a kind, loving old folk, usually to fool people.

To qualify for this trope, a character must be old (by their species' standards), and must also be visibly aged. Even if they're Really 700 Years Old, it doesn't count if they look like a ten-year-old child. Just being a cranky old man is not enough to qualify one as evil, either. World domination, death to humans, or anything else that could be pulled off by younger villains are all suitable goals to make one qualify as an Evil Old Folk. If they happen to be really old and remain young by stealing the youth of others, it can count so long as they occasionally look old.

Due to their age and the fact that they are still committing evil, they are never likely to go face on the Sorting Algorithm of Face-Heel Turning chart.

See Liquid Assets for evil old folks who look young by stealing the youth of others. Compare Nazi Grandpa, Racist Grandma, Dirty Old Man, Grumpy Old Man and Gruesome Grandparent. See also Silly Rabbit, Idealism Is for Kids! and Jade-Colored Glasses. A Wicked Witch is likely (although not guaranteed) to be this, because Beauty Equals Goodness, and (physical) beauty is most commonly associated with youth and innocence, not age and experience or wisdom. For old folks who were evil when they were your age, try Retired Monster. If being evil itself has aged the character, that might be a form of Evil Makes You Ugly. Contrast Cool Old Guy (where the old folk is cool, evil or not) and Older Hero vs. Younger Villain (where the villain is younger than the hero).

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   The _Area 88_ manga and OVA has Guiseppe Farina, an Italian mafia don and arms dealer who collaborates with Kanzaki and Asran's anti-government forces.
    -   McCoy, the grandfatherly arms dealer who provides arms and provisions for Area 88, also qualifies. Despite having sympathetic moments, he's still an amoral arms dealer supporting a bloody civil war and acquiring weapons through dubious means.
-   Szilard Quates of _Baccano!_. Evil deeds including but not limited to betraying a shipload of people who trusted him, enslaving a homunculus of his creation on pain of death, and "devouring" people's minds left and right to increase his own knowledge. Possibly lampshaded in that he once rationalizes some of his behavior by noting his distrust of young people. Quates' Battle Butler notes that he is quite likely the oldest person on earth (which means that he distrusts/will do badly by _everyone else_).
-   _Bakugan_: While not a usual villain, Grandpa Kazami is an Abusive Grandfather to his grandson Shun. He is hard and abusive to him, as well as hostile to anyone not named Shun, and wants to turn him into a ninja and isolate him from his friends. He is even adamant on Shun becoming a ninja _just seconds after the death of Shun’s loving mother._
-   Piemon in the Japanese version of _Digimon Adventure_, who talks in a speech pattern distinctive of old people.
-   Dr. Gero from _Dragon Ball Z_ and _Dragon Ball GT_. Ever since Goku destroyed the Red Ribbon Army as a kid which Gero worked for, he's been watching Goku with Literal Surveillance Bugs so he can create androids to defeat him.
    -   In the earlier _Dragon Ball_, Piccolo Daimaō originally looked ancient and wrinkled like an old prune. This didn't stop him from completely dominating Goku in their first encounter; when he got his youth back thanks to the Dragon Balls, well, it went From Bad to Worse.
-   _Fairy Tail_ has Master Hades, the Big Bad of the Tenrou Island Arc. He's one of the most vile and formidable opponents Fairy Tail faces in the series, and he is even older - and _far_ stronger - than Makarov is. Fairy Tail ONLY won because the secret to his power, the _actual_ Grimoire Heart, was destroyed. Despite this, he has ways of subverting this trope sometimes.
-   _Franken Fran_ had a functionally-immortal old woman who somehow derived sustenance from making her family miserable. And she's not alone...
-   The main antagonist from _Fullmetal Alchemist_. Father has the appearance of an imposing old man robed in white, and though he can be somewhat goofy at times, his evil is hardly a secret. He's behind nearly every tragedy in the series.
    -   Two of Father's henchmen also count. King Bradley/Wrath is in his 60s, and the Gold-Toothed Doctor is even older. Both are very bad dudes.
    -   Dante from _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_. When she's first introduced, she seems like a genuinely nice old woman, and Alphonse in particular seems to take a liking to her. After all, an old bonnet-wearing pharmacist couldn't possibly be the leader of the homunculi, right?
-   _Gundam_:
    -   Used with depressing regularity in _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_, which opted to use age as a visual shorthand to show audiences whether a villain was an Anti-Villain or an irredeemable monster. Starter Villain characters Alex and Mueller were the only villains under 25 who stayed pure villains — Lady Une, Dorothy, Zechs and Treize all went on to get Character Development, even as the latter two became the Big Bads of the series. Compare them to old timers Tubarov, Duke Dermail, the Romefeller Foundation members, Quinze and Dekim Barton, all of whom were introduced as and remained stock Smug Snakes.
    -   Contrasting with _Gundam Wing's_ love of this trope is _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_, which made sure to follow up the evil old man of Master Asia (who would eventually be revealed as an Anti-Villain himself) with Prime Minister Wong, a young man in spite of his position as the supreme ruler of space. In the DVD notes, director Yasuhiro Imagawa specifically noted he made Wong a young character to avoid this trope.
-   Mikado of _Hayate the Combat Butler_. Nagi's grandfather, targetted the Power of the Gods prior to the story started, and messed with Hayate growing up as Santa! Perverted as well.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Enya Geil from Part 3 is a cunning, _nasty_ old woman who tries to get revenge on the heroes for killing her depraved psychopath of a son.
    -   Dario Brando, father of Dio Brando is also an example. He was a wife-beating self-centered drunk who tormented Dio as a child and was the largest contributing factor to Dio's personality. Perhaps everything could have been avoided had Dario just been a little nicer to his son...
    -   A few minor Stand Users also fall in here. Professional murderer-thief Gray Fly, former cult leader Kenzo, Yoshikage Kira's father Yoshihiro...
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Danzou (72), who's one of the Hidden Leaf Village's head elders and a ruthless war hawk who's willing to do things the rest of the village considers morally putrid. He overlaps with Well-Intentioned Extremist, as everything he does, he does with the intent of helping the Hidden Leaf Village. He does it through underhanded political manipulation, and lets revenge get the better of him, however, that he becomes pretty unsympathetic.
    -   For that matter, Kakuzu (91) and Madara Uchiha (who was _least_ in his 80s before his death and resurrection) are among two of the oldest humans in the entire world. Orochimaru would count too, being in his 50s, but he retains his youth by possessing new bodies.
-   _One Piece_ has the Five Elders, the leaders of the World Government, which basically makes them rulers of the world. They certainly have an ominous presence, and some of their decisions so far have been **very** questionable such as the genocide of an island of scholars who knew too much about the world's history.
-   Drosselmeyer from _Princess Tutu_, an evil old fucker if there ever was one. He torments the characters for no other reason than believing it makes for a better story.
-   In the actual _Ranma ½_ series, the (small) Old Master Happōsai is often described as the ultimate evil. Trying to think of a good deed for Christmas made him _explode_ with pain, and, in the animated version, he was evil enough to made a suddenly Not So Harmless Evil Oni writhe in pure agony.
-   _R.O.D the TV_ has a twist on this: the Evil Old Guy, "Mr. Gentleman," actually died of old age. The antagonists want to resurrect him into Junior's body so he can use his Reality Warper powers to complete their Assimilation Plot.
-   Yubaba from _Spirited Away_ is the wicked owner of the bathhouse, and has the nasty habit of stealing people's names once they begin working for her. The fact that she enslaves nature spirits doesn't help her case either. Turning hapless human intruders into pigs or pieces of coal, used for food and fuel respectively.
-   General Vamp of the Evil Organization Florsheim from _Tentai Senshi Sunred_ looks and acts like a fuzzy old man and has the goal of World Domination, right after he crushes his Arch-Enemy Sunred. Fortunately for the world, he _is_ a fuzzy old man and about as 'evil' as a boot; Sunred won't even fight him directly because he'd look like someone bullying the elderly if he did.
-   _Tiger & Bunny_'s Big Bad is Albert Maverick, who seems so nice in the first half of the series...until we learn what he's really like. Eventually picks up the Villain Ball and runs with it.
-   Joejoe, Mokkoi, Chiyo, Zaus, and Kousairou in _Toriko_.
-   In _The Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk_, we learn that King Gilgamesh is immortal, as his mortal self was sealed atop the tower. As he grows older, his heart grows colder, until he becomes a cold-blooded tyrant who slaughters his own citizens.
-   For the first three arcs of _Umineko: When They Cry_, Kinzo isn't portrayed quite so much as evil as he is crazy and desperate. Then comes the fourth arc, and he definitely crosses that boundary. By the end of the arc, though, it's subverted, since Kinzo was dead the entire time.
-   Emperor Dornkirk in _The Vision of Escaflowne_, even more so for being hooked up to a life-support machine.
-   Kagemaru from season 1 of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ is so old he has to live in a giant tube with robotic arms. That all changes once he draws life force from other cards thanks to the Sangenma.
-   _Zatch Bell!_ has a Filler Villain named Dr. Ichiro (Dr. Hakase in the dub) who wants to use his demon to get his revenge on the scientific community for mocking his ideas. And from there? Take over the world.

    Comic Books 

-   In _All Fall Down_, IQ lives in a squalid retirement home and has not lost an inch of his hate for the good guys.
-   In _The Batman Adventures_, "The Perfesser" is a gray-haired old academic who's seen it all a hundred times, and at least some of the time, honestly doesn't seem to really _care_ if he succeeds or not.
-   _Birthright_: God-King Lore looks like an humanoid abomination, but that is merely his transformed state. His true form is that of an grey-bearded old man who tries to present himself in a pleasant grandfatherly manner to The Hero in order to gain his favor and manipulate him.
-   _Black Moon Chronicles_: Big Bad Haazheel Thorn, leader of the Black Moon and the forces of evil opposed to the Empire of Lynn, looks downright ancient.
-   _Black Order_: While we know next to nothing about his race, including their aging process, Ebony Maw certainly looks the part.
-   The Dark Horse imprint _Conan the Barbarian_ had the Bone Woman, an evil magical crone who put her pupil through a truly abhorrent Training from Hell to turn her into the perfect weapon. Her goal was to unleash an Eldritch Abomination upon the earthly plane.
-   DC Comics villains Granny Goodness (pictured above) and DeSaad, New Gods and minions of Darkseid. Interestingly, both are actually _younger_ than their master, who doesn't quite fit the trope himself; it may have something to do with his personal power being far greater than theirs. Also, they look vaguely human while Darkseid's visage looks like it was carved out of granite.
-   The Disney Ducks Comic Universe has Blackheart Beagle The Beagle Boys' grandfather, founder and occasional leader who is about one hundred years.
-   _Fables_:
    -   Frau Totenkinder. She may look like a frail old woman though she could easily undo her aging if she wished, but she is every unnamed witch in fairy tales; meaning she is one of the most powerful Fables alive. While she is firmly aligned with Fabletown, even a cursory glance into her past will reveal that she was(is?) _not_ a good person. She even fought Baba Yaga at one point and, in a rather Eviler than Thou manner, defeated her.
    -   The series' original main villain, The Adversery a.k.a. Geppetto also qualifies. He's a genocidal conqueror who just handwaves away all the atrocities his troops have committed, and shows absolutely no remorse for any of it.
-   _Howard the Duck_ had a foe called the Kidney Lady who was obsessed with the notion that there was some widespread conspiracy threatening people's kidneys. (Maybe illegal organ trafficking, maybe purposely marketing food that was high in cholesterol, anything that might involve them) and was also obsessed with the notion that Howard was involved in said conspiracy. It may have been easy to write her off as some nutty Conspiracy Theorist, but she wasn't harmless, being a witch of some sort who could teleport herself and animate objects, in one story creating a monster called the Chair-Thing.
-   _Nnewts_: The Snake Lord turns out to be Anthigar's brother Denthigar, who like Anthigar, has been around since the beginning of the world.
-   Garth Ennis opened his run on _The Punisher MAX_ by having Frank Castle take out a mob boss who had clocked at a hundred (he's basically a vegetable at this point but mobsters don't get that old by being nice). His widow makes an appearance in one of the final arcs, and she's a real nasty piece of work as well.
    -   The elderly leader of the human trafficking ring in the "Slavers" arc is a veteran of the Yugoslavian wars who carved a swathe of atrocities across Eastern Europe even before he went into human slavery as a business (unfortunately, he's better at atrocities than at business, causing a rift with his son).
    -   Nesbitt, the elderly Irish gangster from the "Kitchen Irish" arc, is incredibly old and nasty, even for this trope. A Posthumous Character, he plays a significant role in the flashbacks, having been one of the original Irish gangsters that ran Hell’s Kitchen before the Italian mob took over. He still terrorized the neighborhood even as an old man, made life a living hell for the titular Kitchen Irish when they were kids, and apparently molested one of the girls. No one dared to retaliate because rumor had it he still had a lot of his connections from the old days. After Nesbitt finally died, he left a set of numbers to the leaders of each faction of the Kitchen Irish that led to a hidden stash of $10 million, knowing that they'd kill each other rather than work together and split the money. On the off-chance that they ever actually did put aside hostilities, which they did end up doing, the treasure was a trap; it's just a block of C-4 with "CUNTS" carved into it, wired to a trigger mechanism.
-   _Shazam!_: Captain Marvel, Jr. fought a villain named Greybeard a couple of times. Sentenced to 99 years in prison when he was a young man, Greybeard served his entire sentence. On his release, he became a supervillain, basing his crimes around the theme of age, to take revenge on a world that had passed him by.
    -   Doctor Sivana, while not quite as extreme an example, also fit the bill, seemingly at least in his late fifties.
    -   Aunt Minerva is another example, an elderly widow who became a criminal after the death of her husband. (Her Post-Crisis counterpart Lady M doesn't _exactly_ fit the trope, since she's usually under a Latex Perfection beauty aid called Neoderm, and uses her regular elderly appearance as a Secret Identity.)
-   _Sin City_ has the Roarke brothers who are powerful politicians who run crime in the city and harbor Serial Killers. Both of them are easily in their sixties or older. There is also the short story entitled _Rats_ about a retired Nazi war criminal.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   The most famous is probably the Vulture, who briefly possessed the ability to steal the youth of others.
    -   Debuting in the same issue is The Tinkerer, who was likewise decrepitly old, though in his first appearance, this was a (later retconned) disguise to hide the fact that he was an alien.
    -   There's also elderly crime boss Silvermane, who was doing the youth-stealing schtick way before Vulture was, via a Fountain of Youth. Silvermane also cheated death by becoming a cyborg and _still_ remained a crotchety old man, even as a severed head.
-   _Star Wars Legacy_: Darth Krayt is almost two hundred years old, looks visibly aged under his mask, and is suffering from a parasitic infection that is slowly killing him. He’s also the genocidal Emperor of the Galactic Empire and the Dark Lord of the Sith, so his advanced age and deteriorating health do _not_ prevent him from trouncing the much younger Cade Skywalker in lightsaber combat.
-   _The Transformers: Robots in Disguise_ has Galvatron, who takes over the Decepticons after Megatron's Heel–Face Turn in _The Transformers: Dark Cybertron_\- in this continuity they're two completely separate characters instead of Galvatron being a more powerful upgraded version of Megatron. He's extremely old even by Cybertronian standards and his appearance is more outwardly savage and barbaric to fit with his ancient and uncivilized personality.
-   _The Ultimates_: Tyrone Cash is a withered, crippled dirty old man when he isn't hulked out, living large in a life of crime and indulgence that comes crashing down when Nick Fury comes knocking at his doorstep.
-   Issus in _Warlord of Mars_ is the megalomaniacal tyrant that ruled as a living goddess over Barsoom for ages, instituting a oppressive system of slavery and rape among its people. While most Martians age very slowly and often are centuries old, Issus looks like a hag as a result being being hundreds of thousands of years.
-   _X-Men_: The X-Men have their fair share of these to contend with. The most famous is definitely Magneto, though he's achieved enough Character Development that whether or not he qualifies for this trope in modern stories is purely Depending on the Writer.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Magneto aside, X-folks also have to contend with Apocalypse (who in some stories is just a withered geezer inside some _very_ advanced Powered Armor), Black Womb, and Kaga.

    Eastern Animation 

-   Koshchei from _The Frog Princess_, is an old, evil sorcerer who transforms a princess into a frog because she laughed at his marriage proposal.
-   Kylina in _Mavka: The Forest Song_, of the older than she looks variety due to using a rejuvenating liquid she's running out of. She's an evil woodswoman who seeks to destroy the forest in order to find the source of that liquid in its heart.
-   One-Eye in _Speckles: The Tarbosaurus_ was already a full grown, heavily scarred adult _Tyrannosaurus rex_ when Speckles, the titular _Tarbosaurus_ was a kid, and survives long enough to continue hunting and fighting adult Speckles.

    Fairy Tales 

-   Baba Yaga. A powerful and immortal old witch of Russian folklore. Sometimes an enemy, sometimes a guide—but always, always dangerous.
-   Also from Russian folklore, Koschei the Deathless, who shows up in _The Death of Koschei the Deathless_, _Tsarevich Petr and the Wizard_ and other tales, is a powerful and immortal sorcerer.
-   Actually, many witches in fairy tales and folklore are old.

    Fan Works 

-   In the canon of _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_, Grand Elder Guru is made to be this. Whilst a lot of what he does seems like simple jerkassery (declaring that he wishes to be known as Super Kami Guru, being callous and rude to virtually everyone in his presence, stopping his heart whilst Gohan, Krillin and Dende are using the Namekian Dragon Balls), what pushes him into this is The Reveal that he caused the Great Drought on Namek by drinking all the water, and blamed it on the albino Namekians, which were then all slaughtered per his orders. It is also revealed that he and Lord Slug split from the same being, and Guru is the evil half.
-   Cocoa Mocha in _Manehattan's Lone Guardian_ is old enough to have teenage grandchildren, is dying from the effects of age, and is slightly senile. At the same time, he has a serious grudge against Princess Celestia, a desire to boot her off Equestria's throne permanently, and the agents with which to carry out his plans.
-   _Megami no Hanabira:_ Father Archibald Phillips is an arthritic geezer in his 90's, the mastermind behind a demon outbreak that destroyed a city and killed hundreds of thousands, and a misanthropic, utterly self-centered sociopath who seeks to establish and then rule over an oppressive, theocratic One World Order. He gets even more evil during his Villainous Breakdown.
-   A running gag in _Ranma ½: The Abridged Chronicles_ is the old folks living in the town who seek world domination. At first it was just Ranma's suspicions that one old lady was up to no good, but later several senior citizens gathered outside were plotting to "strike at midnight," and another attempted to kill Ryōga after he found her a good spot from which to plot world domination.
-   In _The Fall of the Fire Empire_, an alternate universe fic of _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, Azula is the Dragon Empress of the Fire Empire, even when she’s over a century old. She’s also an Omnicidal Maniac who intends to burn the world down.
-   _Ducktales: Twenty Years Later_: Steelbeak is still alive, though now well into his 60's at least. He's still a vicious asshole.

    Films — Animation 

-   Cryptograf from Asterix and the Vikings, Timandahaf's soothsayer who tries to get his son Olaf into the position of king by capturing the "Champion of Fear".
-   Several Disney villains would qualify for this trope, with one of the standouts being Lady Tremaine, Cinderella's Wicked Stepmother.
    -   Pixar seems to love this trope as well. _Toy Story 2_ had Stinky Pete, _Monsters, Inc.._ had Mr. Waternoose, _Up_ had Charles Muntz, _Toy Story 3_ had Lotso, and _Lightyear_ had Zurg, who is revealed to be an older version of Buzz Lightyear himself from an alternate timeline.
    -   However, the _all-time king_ of these villains, Disney Animated Canon and Pixar alike, is likely the Coachman from _Pinocchio_.
    -   A more humorous example is Yzma from _The Emperor's New Groove_. No one seems to know exactly how old she is, but she's described as "scary beyond all reason" and is trying to get her surrogate son killed to take over his throne.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Bloodthirsty_: Vera, Vaughn's elderly housekeeper, appears creepy and cold from the beginning. Then near the end Vera tries to murder Grey, and is a willing accomplice to Vaughn's murders.
-   _Brimstone_: By the end, the Reverend is an old, grey-haired man, but he's only become more psychotic over the years.
-   Judge Smails from _Caddyshack_.
-   Noah Cross from _Chinatown_. Not only is he a greedy Corrupt Corporate Executive who wants to control Los Angeles's water supply but he raped his own daughter Evelyn Mulawray _since she was 14_.
-   The MacCreadys from _Cloak & Dagger (1984)_.
-   _Feeding Frenzy_: The main villain in this 2010 film is Mr. Plinkett, an old man in a wheelchair who served in the Vietnam War and whose wife died in 1975. That said, he's played by a man in his thirties, with minimal effort made to age him up.
-   _Halloween (2018)_: Michael Myers, despite being 40 years removed from his initial killing spree in the original film, has lost none of his lethality or maliciousness.
-   _Halloween at Aunt Ethel's_: The titular Aunt Ethel is a grey-haired old woman who spends her time killing people and making their corpses into Halloween candy, or burning them behind her barn.
-   In _Hook_, Captain Hook has become an old man while Peter grew up in the outside world. His trademark fear of ticking clocks isn't due to the crocodile (which he killed) anymore. He's afraid of time slipping away from him. His entire scheme is merely a means to have one final decisive fight with Peter Pan before time claims him.
-   _Enola Holmes_: The Dowager murdered her own son and plans to murder her grandson all to stop them from supporting the Reform Bill at the House of Lords
-   Old Man Peanut (John Hurt) in _44 Inch Chest_ is an angry, foul-mouthed, bigoted, and sadistic elderly London Gangster.
-   _Hot Fuzz_: Every character past middle age, except, strangely, Bill Nighy — and the look _he_ gives Angel after he says "Yes I can, I'm the Chief Inspector" looks like he's really enjoying transferring Angel out.
-   _Iron Man_: Obadiah Stane is relatively old, having been in charge of Stark Industries when Tony was a teenager, and is certainly not a nice guy. At least, if selling weapons to terrorists then attempting to kill Tony and go on a rampage with his own giant suit is any indication.
-   _X-Men Film Series_: Magneto is the primary antagonist of the trilogy, a ruthless mutant supremacist.
-   Henry Potter from _It's a Wonderful Life_.
-   The eponymous Bill, Pai Mai and Esteban Vihaio from _Kill Bill_.
-   Arthur, the elderly leader of _Kingsman: The Secret Service_, after he's swayed into Valentine's plan and proceeds to try to poison Eggsy.
-   Wilson, Terry Valentine, and Avery in _The Limey_.
-   Immortan Joe in _Mad Max: Fury Road_. His real age is unknown, but he is clearly not young. He is also probably the darkest villain in the entire series, holding women as cattle and Sex Slaves, and ruling his corner of the Wasteland with an iron fist.
-   _Nothing but Trouble_: The J.P. is friggin' ancient, being a 106-year old Hanging Judge. He's almost completely immobile and depends on his grandchildren for muscle.
-   Grandma Lois, as well as her fellow coven members from _Paranormal Activity 3_.
-   _Prisoners_: Countless children are abducted and murdered by Mr. and Mrs. Jones.
-   Most of the Satanists seen in _Rosemary's Baby_ are old. For this reason, Rosemary holds a party for young adults only.
-   _Saw_: John "Jigsaw" Kramer, who was 52 years old at the time of his death.
-   Brick Top from _Snatch._.
-   _Son of the Mask_: Odin, Ruler of Asgard and Valhalla. His wrathful arrogance and his tyrannical all-mighty stature are physically dead giveaways. He's grown more impatient as his son Loki fails time and time again to find and recover the lost God-Mask.
-   _Star Wars_ has several:
    -   Emperor Palpatine, who in his first appearance in _The Empire Strikes Back_ looks like a white raisin left too long in water. A raisin with sleep problems. It's revealed in _Revenge of the Sith_ that his appearance isn't just because of his old age but actually scarring from Mace Windu deflecting force lightning back into his face.
    -   Jabba the Hutt, being 600 years old. He is an example, but not an extreme one. Hutts typically live ten times longer than humans.
    -   Count Dooku from the prequels, who looks more like a dignified elderly statesman than a terrible Sith Lord. In fact, most of Christopher Lee's roles from the past few decades likely count.
    -   Implied with Archduke Poggle the Lesser, who uses a cane rather than flying and has facial tendrils resembling a long beard.
-   Tatie Danielle is far away from your sweet old auntie, that's for sure. After her caretaker's death — for which she was pretty responsible — she gets to live with her grandnephew's family. Woe to them...
-   Momma from _Throw Momma from the Train_
    
    **Larry Donner:** She's not a woman— she's the Terminator!
    
-   The Duke brothers from _Trading Places_ decide to completely upend the lives of two men for the sake of a dollar.
-   R.J. Fletcher from _UHF_.
-   Parodied with Old Man McGinty in _Mystery Team_. Despite being clearly comatose, the trio still suspects him of murder.
-   Both of the grandparents in _The Visit_ both have something very deeply wrong with them. Grandpa gets... a little too intimate with his shotgun while he's cleaning it, and Grandma practically turns into a werewolf at night, scratching at the door frantically while stark naked. Turns out there's nothing supernatural going on. They're just crazy, in fact they're not even the kid's real grandparents; they're mental asylum inmates who escaped, murdered them, and took their place.
-   Ichirō Yashida from _The Wolverine_. His old age and impending death are what makes him so desperate to gain Wolverine's power.

    Literature 

-   Ctuchik from _The Belgariad_ is an Evil Sorcerer and Sinister Minister who serves as The Dragon to God of Evil Torak. Appearing as an ancient old man with a long, yellow, filthy Wizard Beard, and a face ravaged by centuries of depravity and excess, he's a Type A Elderly Immortal, and a Deceptive Disciple to his god, plotting to Take Over the World himself. His colleague and Co Dragon, Zedar, is another, far more sympathetic example, being a former good guy who was drafted into serving Torak.
-   While not _evil_ per se, Shapoklyak in Cheburashka is a petty and nasty old lady who believes infamy is the shortest path to fame.
-   Kurt Dussander in the _Different Seasons_ story _Apt Pupil_ is at first a Retired Monster, but through Todd's forced recollections of Nazi atrocities, he gradually turns into this.
-   Dracula himself was described as an elderly man with a prominent mustache when Jonathan Harker first encountered him and, of course, is one of the most infamous and evil vampires in all of fiction. While he manages to reverse his aging with enough blood consumption, he doesn't get any prettier.
-   Fistandantilus of _Dragonlance_ is so old that it's tough to find an artifact or ancient manuscript that can honestly be said to predate him- he uses a variety of unpleasant means to keep himself going. Because he always wears a Black Cloak with the hood up, the only part of him anyone ever sees are his hands, which are little more than withered, age-spotted talons. A few characters speculate as to what his face looks like, but come to the conclusion it's something best left unknown.
-   In _The First Law_, Bayaz seems to be just an old wizard and Eccentric Mentor at first, but he's actually a Manipulative Bastard who's behind most of the reasons why the world is so messed up. Granted, his enemy Khalul (another evil old person) isn't any better, but he _is_ right about Bayaz. Black-and-Gray Morality is very much in play here.
-   _De Griezelbus_: In one of the stories, a girl begins an Intergenerational Friendship with a sweet old lady who listens to all her woes. Eventually, one of the girl's bullies goes missing. It turns out the old woman killed her with a butcher's knife and used her fingers to make a birthday pie.
-   Reigner One of _Hexwood_ seems a kindly old man. He isn't.
-   In _House of the Scorpion_, El Patrón is the ancient ruler of Opium, a nation built out of the US-Mexican border and based on enslaving illegal immigrants (from both sides) by turning them into what amounts to zombies, and the international drug trade. And he maintains his long life through harvesting the organs of clones.
-   _The Hunger Games_:
    -   Coriolanus Snow is an oppressive tyrant who has presided as President of Panem for decades, largely responsible for the rotten state it is in.
    -   The prequel _The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes_ has Dr. Volumnia Gaul, who manipulates Snow like fiddle, has no qualms about using her creations to hurt others, and is ultimately responsible for the Hunger Games becoming a staple of Panem.
-   _Jaine Austen Mysteries_: Several of the killers turn out to be senior citizens, including:
    -   Wells Dumont in _Last Writes_, albeit in a Downplayed way given his motive and general kindness outside of the murder.
    -   Ethel Cox from "The Dangers of Candy Canes".
    -   Clyde "Doc" Wilkins from "The Dangers of Gingerbread Cookies".
    -   Emily Pritchard in _Killer Cruise_.
    -   Skip Holmeier III from _Killing Cupid_.
    -   Emma Shimmel posing as Daisy Kincaid from _Death of a Gigolo_.
-   Viv Ivins, the Evil Mentor of Marilena Carpathia in the _Left Behind_ book series who convinced her to have her only son Nicolae and then had the mother disposed of so that she and her organization could raise him for the purpose of becoming the Antichrist. She also was the implementer of the Mark of the Beast loyalty system during the latter half of the Tribulation.
-   Played with in the last _Nursery Crimes_ book by Eric Weiner, _There Was An Old Woman_, where a girl going to college in Manhattan learns that there've been a string of missing students from her school, and all of them lived in the same boarding house. When the evidence points to the perpetrator possibly being an older woman, the girl and her friends go on the lookout for a suspicious looking woman. They encounter at least two women who are frightening, until it's narrowed down to the owner of the house, the main character's psych professor, and her own mother.
-   Felix Jongleur in Tad Williams' _Otherland_ is the oldest living human being by quite a few decades, and the Corrupt Corporate Executive of the local MegaCorp. He keeps his crippled body clinging to life in a support capsule lined with machinery while he spends his time in the 'Net. All of his considerable resources are dedicated to one task: learning how to cheat the inevitable death of his body, and he's willing to go to any lengths to accomplish it.
-   _Piranesi_ has a brief appearance by an elderly character who turns out to be the smug and thoroughly sociopathic past instigator of the whole nightmarish situation — and also almost certainly a murderer, and definitely a complete Karma Houdini.
-   The Gentleman fits this well in the _Spider-Man: Sinister Six Trilogy_. Well into his nineties, he decides to spend his golden years on a plot to crash the world economy.
-   In the sequel to _Those That Wake_, the Old Man is centuries old and is barely able to move on his own.
-   A sweeping description of many of the villainous characters (Evil Matriarch, Dirty Old Man) in V. C. Andrews books.
-   Judge Fulgence, in _Wash This Blood Clean From My Hand_, by Fred Vargas, definitely qualified before his fake death. He stabbed nine people with a trident between 1949 and 1987 and three more between 1987 and 2003, always leaving a convenient culprit for the police to find (drunk or knocked-out people, preferably homeless, with the supposed crime weapon in their hands). One of those culprits was the protagonist's brother, who has spent more than thirty years not knowing whether or not he had really killed his girlfriend.
-   _Welcome To Wonderland_: Book one, "Home Sweet Motel", has Stanley and Sydney Sneemer. They're a pair of elderly jewel thieves who pulled off a heist in 1973, and went to jail for it. Now that they're out, they've returned to collect their loot.
-   Emperor Henrick in _The Witchlands_ is going to some shady lengths to force Safi to marry him, and he's easily three times her age.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_ Cyvus Vail is a demon sorcerer whose goals include ensuring the smooth progression of the apocalypse and seems like he's at risk of dropping dead any moment. Although he's not as frail as he acts.
-   _Babylon 5_: Justin, the "man in the middle" and human emissary of the Shadows in "Z'ha'dum", comes across as a fairly harmless and polite elderly gentleman while explaining the Shadow philosophy of strength through conflict and how some must be killed "for the dream". In the Expanded Universe book _The Shadow Within_, we see that he was the one on the _Icarus_ who most readily embraced the Shadows when the crew "woke" them — even Morden only decided to serve them in return for a merciful ending for his loved ones trapped consciously in a bubble of hyperspace after a transport explosion a few years ago. Justin just seemed intrigued or intoxicated by the sheer power they possessed, regardless of the evils it would be put to use for.
-   _Cobra Kai_:
    -   Applies to both Cobra Kai founders, John Kreese and Terry Silver. Both men have aged considerably about three decades after _Part III_ (which featured them as adults in their late 30s-early 40s), but are still legitimate threats to the valley due to their continuous approach to the "Way of the Fist's" ruthless methods.
    -   While evil might seem a bit much on Sid Weinberg's part (given that he has a few Pet the Dog moments to Johnny throughout Season 1 and him being less of a threat compared to Cobra Kai themselves), there's no denying that he was verbally and emotionally abusive to Johnny himself — which results in Johnny turning to Cobra Kai and eventually becoming disillusioned with him. That's not counting his Lack of Empathy towards Miguel's near-death experience and "that little incident with his secretary" coupled with Johnny not-so-subtly mentioning #MeToo word-for-word heavily implying that he is a sexual predator.
-   _The Colbert Report_: In the January 21 2010 episode, lists "Old People" on the Threat Down, due to all the old folks who go on airplanes with swords and knives hidden in their canes.
-   _Criminal Minds_: A few UnSubs fall into this category, but Anita Roycewood from "Mosley Lane" stands out the most. Despite "only" having 9 kills, she commits some of the worst crimes possible in the series, with children being abducted, locked up in a basement for decades, dyed and renamed, physically abused (with implied sexual abuse), and if the victims grow old enough or are too difficult to control, she **cremates them alive**.
-   _Cutey Honey The Live_: The nice old lady who owns a fish shop is one of Panther Claw's highest ranking generals. Get in her way and she will bludgeon you to death, cut you up with frozen food, or just use the _missile launchers built into her stomach._ But however she kills you, she'll do it without losing her kind, motherly demeanor for a second.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Tilda and Tabby from "Paradise Towers" cook and eat their guests. It is also implied that everyone of their generation does.
    -   Lady Cassandra is nothing but a Brain in a Jar connected to an animated piece of skin taken from her already gone body when the Doctor and Rose meet her in "The End of the World" — that is, until she takes an interest in Rose and her new appeal in "New Earth". She is one of the most elitist and pretentious characters of the series and is thousands of years old.
    -   "Amy's Choice" has a retirement home full of evil pensioners taken over by a race of aliens. However, that was a dream.
-   _Foundation (2021)_: Cleon XII, who serves as Brother Dusk for most of Season 1, is by far the most ruthless of the Emperors, the most devoted to the genetic dynasty and enforcing its purity, and the one who shows the least regard for the well-being of Imperial citizens. Accordingly, he's the antagonist of Cleon XIV's arc and ultimately the only one who doesn't mourn the younger clone's death.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Craster has reached his elder years, and also rapes his daughters and sacrifices his sons.
    -   Walder Frey is the second-oldest character seen in the show (after Aemon Targaryen - though possibly excepting Old Nan, while she was still alive), and certainly one of the most evil.
-   _Goosebumps (1995)_: In the episode "The Haunted House Game", one of the spots the two kids land on takes them to a house where two old women are playing a game. They're supposed to ask them for something, which turns out to be an amulet that saps the life out of the girl's arm.
-   _Heroes_: Daniel Linderman and Arthur Petrelli, the Big Bads of Volumes One and Three, are both in their sixties. In fact, they were Army buddies during the Vietnam War before becoming Fallen Heroes.
-   At one point in _Koreanosaurus_, Patch the _Tarbosaurus_ and his siblings encounter an elderly member of their species, who is very sickly and has a weakened sense of smell. Despite this, as soon as he notices Patch and his siblings (who are still juveniles), he tries to eat them. Fortunately, Patch’s mother arrives and saves her children.
-   _The League of Gentlemen_: Tubbs and Edward, who torture and sometimes kill any non-locals who intrude on their shop.
-   _Leverage_: Nate's dad Jimmy is an aging member of The Irish Mob who, having lost his former position of influence in the Boston underworld during a long prison term, is scheming to get it back.
-   _Malcolm in the Middle_: Ida, Lois' mother and the boys' maternal grandmother is a sinister and unpleasant old crone willing to sue her own family or to drug a man into marrying her.
-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ has the "Hell's Grannies" sketch, about a gang of old ladies who go around acting like Quincy punks and tormenting the youth.
-   Several villains are of elder age in _Resurrection: Ertuğrul_, including:
    -   Grand Master Petruchio Manzini, who commands the Amanus Mountains Knights Templar in season 1 in spite of his inability to actively fight his enemies.
    -   Kurdoglu Bey, younger sibling of Kayi chief Suleyman Shah and very much envious of the latter’s position, driving him to numerous ends to knock him out of the seat and claim it for himself.
    -   Alpargu, one of the de-facto minions of Kurdoglu during his feat of conquest, also counts as this.
    -   Afsin Bey veers into this territory after murdering Numan Efendi. The only way this could be even loosely justified is that the latter had intended on rebelling against Sultan Alaeddin’s orders.
    -   Emir Sadettin Kopek is an even nastier example than the previously listed characters, first shown releasing Noyan from Kayi imprisonment in season 2 before going on to commit higher-stakes atrocities like getting another Emir framed for trying to kill Sultan Kayqubad and then poisoning his dinner peasant so he could take the sultan out of the picture and attain the throne, among numerous other activities.
    -   Tekfur Kritos sends his son to work with Tekfur Ares to attack the Kayis, then decides to get personally involved after hearing about said son’s death, showing no compunction or sympathy for Ertugrul the whole way through.
-   _Revolution_: Tom Neville, despite his age never being stated, is older than a lot of characters, and he'll betray and murder people in cold blood to get what he wants. The actor playing the character, Giancarlo Esposito, is 55 years old.
-   _Smallville_: Granny Goodness combines this with Straight Edge Evil and Bitch in Sheep's Clothing for genuinely frightening results.
-   _The Sopranos_:
    -   Possibly the most evil person the show (which, for the record, is about Mafiosi) is Livia Soprano, Tony's aged mother. Extraordinarily manipulative, and not above putting a hit on her own son if it gets her what she wants.
    -   Uncle Junior, Tony's uncle, and of Livia's generation. In the first episode, he is plotting to kill a rival at his favorite restaurant. He becomes boss of the North Jersey Mob shortly thereafter, and conspires with Livia to kill Tony.
-   _Succession_: media baron Logan Roy, the patriarch of the show's central family, is well into his later years and really should have retired, but his malice seems to do a good job of keeping him alive and in the game.
-   _Teen Wolf_: Gerard Argent, patriarch of the Argent family and the Big Bad of Season 2. Initially plays up the persona of the doddering old grandpa until he takes control of the Kanima and reveals himself to be a sociopathic, manipulative monster willing to kill anybody and everybody to ensure his own survival, including his own family. Not to mention his contradictory hatred of werewolves when he was perfectly willing to become a werewolf himself to cure his cancer. _After_ he told his son to help his wife commit suicide when she was turning into a werewolf to preserve the family's honor.
-   The Terror pops up in _The Tick (2016)_, being by far the oldest and evilest of any of the villains. His exact age is unknown, but he's been active as a super villain (let alone alive) for decades. Unlike other incarnations of The Terror who basically exists as a Scatterbrained Senior parody of a villain, this guy is basically a parody of Emperor Palpatine and an incredibly dangerous and sadistic monster who's only motivation for evil is "because."
-   _Todd and the Book of Pure Evil_: It is revealed that virtually all of the residents of the Crowley Heights retirement home are Satanists. Considering they were keeping a man captive and drugged, it qualifies for this trope.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1985)_: In "Gramma", a young boy named Georgie has to spend a night watching over his monstrous bed-ridden witch-grandmother.

    Podcasts 

-   From _The Magnus Archives_:
    -   The season 1 episode "Piecemeal" features Angela, who looks like a harmless little old lady but talks casually about having someone horribly killed. The narrator, himself a hardened, violent criminal, recognises in her eyes the look of someone extremely nasty.
    -   Many of the stronger avatars of the Powers are old men, including Maxwell Rayner, Simon Fairchild, Peter Lukas, and Jonah Magnus.
    -   Mary Keay, an old woman who collected Leitners and used them for nefarious purposes. She murdered her husband and abused her son for decades, before forcing him to kill her so that she could bind herself to a Leitner.

    Print Media 

-   This is the only way to describe T. Herman Zweibel, the "Editor" of The Onion since taking it from his father at the age of 20. According to this timeline he has opposed social change of any sorts (he went into a coma upon hearing of the Civil Rights Movement), is indirectly responsible for several historical acts such as the sinking of the _Lusitania_, the assassination of JFK and Archduke Franz Ferdinand (thus indirectly starting World War I) and has put a bounty on the heads of Upton Sinclair and Ring Lardner. Despite being diagnosed with countless diseases and suffering from (to put it generously) crippling senility is still somehow alive and still writing at the age of 140. (Specifically, writing uplifting prose such as his "Huzzah for the Death of a Child!" in which he gloats that a recently deceased eight-year-old was on the organ donor list and thanks to her grisly demise, Zweibel will be able to get drunk again for as much as three weeks before he kills his transplant liver, too...)

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Played with in Ring Warriors with Kevin Sullivan, who attacked grand champion Bruce Santee for no reason other than to prove he was still scary but on the other hand did give some pointers to La Rosa Negra when one of her managers, Rico Casanova, turned on her.
-   While Curt Hennig was a member of the New World Order, the commentators sometimes asked what Curt's father Larry "The Ax" Hennig thought of Curt's career decisions. Considering he showed up to on episode of Nitro in an nWo T-shirt and cheap shotted Curt's opponents, he was clearly just fine with it.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   _The Wild Beyond the Witchlight_: The main antagonists of the module is The Hourglass Coven, which consists of a trio of hags. Each of them are cruel and self-serving, even at the expense of their fellow coven members. They are all also ancient.
-   _Mutants & Masterminds_ has Dr. Sin, an immortal Chinese criminal who appears to be in his seventies or eighties, and elder statesman of supervillainy August Tiberius Roman, who is in his nineties now and only semiretired. Roman in particular is a fixture of the _Freedom City_ setting in some ways, having survived from its Golden Age through the Modern Age, transitioning from Mafia boss, to Diabolical Mastermind, becoming the "Emperor of Crime" of Freedom City, and after losing most of his empire, becoming the owner of an illegal underground series of Gladiator Games.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: Adsrubael Vect, the leader of Commorragh and the Dark Eldar, is one of the most ancient, cunning and vicious creatures in the galaxy, being one of the few who was around during the Fall of the Eldar some 10,000 Earth years prior.

    Theme Parks 

-   Two of the "Icons" from Universal's Halloween Horror Nights:
    -   The Caretaker, who is a super Creepy Mortician and surgeon that kidnaps innocents and subjects to them to horrifically painful deaths, as a way of discovering more about how the average human reacts to pain and death. His age has never been explicitly stated, though with his long white hair and visibly wrinkled skin, he appears to at least be in his late '50s or '60s.
    -   The Storyteller, an evil grandmother-like lady that is able to bring people into her own twisted books; along with having a tendency to rip out the tongues of her victims.

    Video Games 

-   Some of the Templars in _Assassin's Creed II_. The first game had Al-Mualim.
-   Father Comstock from _BioShock Infinite_, an eldery, self-proclaimed "prophet" and ruler of Columbia. In reality, he's somewhere around 30, same as main character Booker Dewitt. Mainly because he IS Booker Dewitt, or rather an alternate universe version who just looks much older due to abusing the Dimensional Tears, which release radiation that causes premature aging.
-   _Dark Souls_, its sequels and _Bloodborne_ are all occasionally called by the nickname "Killing Old Folks to Sad Piano Music: The Game", as many boss battles (including quite a few final bosses) are set against old men who helped set the games' story into motion. Somewhat subverted in that many of these, such as Lord Gwyn, King Vendrick and Gherman have dubious morals, but aren't necessarily evil.
-   The Hag from _Thief: Deadly Shadows_: a centuries-old Serial Killer who skins and murders people including _children_ to extend her own life.
-   Flemeth from _Dragon Age: Origins_: old and evil and very powerful, and only seemingly retired.
-   _Dragon Quest V_: Grandmaster Nimzo takes on the form of a demonic looking old man when the party finally encounters him; however this is merely a guise for his true form, which is far more incomprehensible and demonic.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_:
    -   Riften's Honorhall Orphanage is run by Grelod the Kind, who is anything _but_ what her name would suggest. She is utterly horrible to the children of the orphanage in question, and disobeying her will earn the unfortunate kid an _extra_ beating. In the start of the Dark Brotherhood storyline, you get to kill her, and unlike your other major targets, you won't receive any bounty for doing so. She is _that_ hated.
    -   The Dark Brotherhood has Festus Crex, an elderly sorcerer who loves to blow his enemies up point blank instead of relying on stealth like most assassins.
    -   According to her biography "The Wolf Queen", Potema Septim the most dangerous necromancer to live during her lifetime, was in her seventies by the time of her death. By then, she had amassed a great undead army of draugrs, zombies and vampires and used them to wage war on her siblings in an attempt to take the Imperial throne for herself, or rather her son which she would manipulate.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Giant Fist_: Big Bad Zet is an ancient Latour warrior who was frozen in ice for millennia, only to be thawed out 50 years before the game's start and long enough ago to have produced an adult grandchild who becomes a key NPC of the game. By the time Zet finally appears, the toll of his age and the experiments done to his body by modern humans have become plain in his appearance. The experiments have also twisted his mind, and with the subtle manipulations of the bracelet have driven him into a desire for nothing more than to seek as much vengeance as he can with the life he has left: becoming the guru of a cult to attract streams of worshippers and perform unto them the same horrific experiments that he was forced to endure.
-   _Fallout_:
    -   Allistair Tenpenny from _Fallout 3_ is a wealthy, amiable old man who wants you to nuke a nearby village _because it's an eyesore_. There's also Stanislaus Braun, a Mad Scientist who has spent the past 200 years torturing the residents of Vault 112 in a virtual reality sim of a pre-war town.
    -   _Fallout: New Vegas_: The core game has Caesar, and arguably Mr. House. The _Old World Blues_ DLC has the Think Tanks, who are former scientists who have outlived their bodies by transporting their brains into robots (though they're arguably more insane than truly evil). Finally, the _Dead Money_ DLC has Father Elijah, who is _very_ evil.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Primarch Galenth Dysley from _Final Fantasy XIII_. He's _really_ old too, being an immortal robot god.
    -   _Final Fantasy IX_'s _visibly_ old Garland, who has an Evil Plan that basically intends to suck the life off of Gaia (the world the game takes place in).
-   Most Sinister Minister type villains in _Fire Emblem_ are visibly ancient.
-   _Haunted House_: Before his death, Zachary Graves was a mean, rotten old man who was hated by the community for his attitude. He was also a thief who stole a magic urn that belonged to the town.
-   _Henry Stickmin Series_: Dmitri Johannes Petrov has been the Warden of The Wall for 50 years and there hasn't been an escape in that amount of time, so he has to be older than 70 at least.
-   _Jade Empire_:
    -   Sun Li the Glorious Strategist.
    -   His brother, God-Emperor Sun. He doesn't look old, but he _is_ the eldest brother.
-   Master Xehanort from _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_: the original incarnation of the franchise-long overall Big Bad, and the one who set most of the wheels in motion. While his impending mortality is a factor in his plans, age hasn't actually slowed him down much - he's more than a match for heroes decades younger than him.
-   Kreia a.k.a. Darth Traya from _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_ is a morally ambiguous version of this since she sees herself Above Good and Evil.
-   There is a particularly suspicious one in _MARDEK Chapter 3_. He is defined as Chaotic Evil in the game helper and looks evil. He's the adviser of the king (who joins you) of the lizard village beneath the Sun Temple, leading to the Evil Black Temple, which gets you plot sooner or later.
-   The classic Evil Old Guy of video games would have to be Dr. Albert Wily, an elderly Mad Scientist bent on world domination, with an army of robots at his command.
-   Porky Minch in _Mother 3_. From a troubled boy to a 10,000 to 100,000 year old psychotic immature Evil Overlord hellbent on destroying the world and recreating it as his own playground just for the adrenaline rush and his amusement.
-   Black Hole commander Von Bolt in _Advance Wars: Dual Strike_ keeps himself alive by stealing the energy of Omega Land via his wheelchair, turning it into a wasteland. He shows no regard for any other lifeform in the pursuit of this goal. Unlike some other Immortality Seekers, his appearance actually reflects his age: He is a fat, feeble old man who labors under each breath he draws.
-   _The New Order Last Days Of Europe_ is an Alternate-History Nazi Victory strategy game set in the 1960s and 70s. As a result, most of Those Wacky Nazis and Les Collaborateurs still running around are in their elderly years. Adolf Hitler himself starts off the game at 73 years old.
-   Mr. and Mrs. Cutter from _Ōkami_. Even the weather above their house carries a foreboding feeling.
-   The second _PAGUI_ has the demon-hag, a ghost of an elderly woman who traps the souls of stillborn _babies_ and sends them to attack you during her boss fight.
-   Charon from _Pokémon Platinum_. Doesn't help matters any that he's the oldest Galactic member by at least thirty years.
    -   The Societea from _Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs_ is composed of four really old retired thieves; fittingly, their primary goal is Immortality.
    -   Greevil, Grand Master of Cipher from _Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness_.
-   Ozwell Spencer of the _Resident Evil_ series fulfills this trope when he finally makes an appearance in _Resident Evil 5_.
-   _Riven_, the sequel to _Myst_, replaces the earlier antagonists with their grandfather Gehn. A member of the D'ni race of worldbuilders, he became power-mad and was opposed by his son, who imprisoned him. Years of exile haven't helped Gehn's sanity any, and though he claims to be reformed, he'll gladly and promptly kill you and Atrus the moment he gets within sight of either.
-   Aunas' true form from _Romancing SaGa 3_.
-   "Kindly" Cheng (nickname very much ironic) and "Strangler" Bao (very much _not_) from _Shadowrun Returns: Hong Kong_. Both are in their fifties at the youngest (Kindly talking about living through the VITAS plague 45 years earlier) and are deep in with the Yellow Lotus Triad in Hong Kong. While they never really do much bad to you (being Kindly Cheng's employee), neither of them are Friendly Neighborhood Gangsters by any stretch of the imagination and gleefully indulge in torture, executions, drug dealing, arms smuggling, and stealing medical supplies from a relief effort among others.
-   _Soul At Stake_: Gran "The Witch", one of the "devil" characters.
-   Mr. James Wong of _Stranglehold_.
-   _Super Mario Bros._ also loves this trope:
    -   Kamek, longtime caretaker of Bowser, who makes frequent appearances in recent games.
    -   Smithy from _Super Mario RPG_.
    -   King Bob-omb from _Super Mario 64_.
    -   Goomboss from _Paper Mario_ and the DS remake of the above game, along with Chief Chilly.
    -   In the _Mario & Luigi_ series, there's Cackletta from _Superstar Saga_.
-   _Super Robot Wars: Original Generation_ and its sequel had Adler Koch and Aguila Setme, two instructors from the horrific Personal Trooper training facility known as The School. Their utter sociopathic disregard for other people made sure they were _the_ Hate Sinks among the more misguided members of the Divine Crusaders.
-   _The Tiamat Sacrament_: The Big Bad, Ry'jin, is responsible for driving dragons to near extinction and stealing their DNA for his experiments. He's normally in a hood, but when he takes the hood off, his real appearance is that of an ordinary-looking old man.
-   _TinkerQuarry_ has Stella. Aside from her pale, shriveled appearance, she also has some of the mannerisms of a Granny Classic, such as calling people "dearie". In reality, she's anything but sweet.
-   Calypso in _Twisted Metal_. Mind you, he's a demon, and in some installments appears youthful, but he still looks relatively unkempt.
-   Aloysius Dawson in _Vampyr (2018)_ is a very old and corrupt businessman that has worked as an ally for the Ascalon Club in exchange for immortality. As Dawson nears the end of his life, the main protagonist Jonathan Reid is charged by the Club with turning him into a vampire to be welcomed into their group. Should Jonathan do just that, Dawson will become _much, much worse_ than he was in life: He declares he will arrange his entire family's death so that no one inherits his fortune and that he will begin plotting for Britain to take over Europe and the USA, and then install a vampire king on the throne.
-   _Warcraft_ has Archbishop Benedictus. Old man, looks weak and decrepit, is a non-fighting priest of the Holy Light. That doesn't sound evil at all, right? Well, in Cataclysm, he allies with the evil Aspect of Death, becomes the Twilight Prophet dedicated to wiping out all life, enslaves a blue dragon princess, creates a monster so awful that not even the four dragonflights can take it out without help from Thrall, and eventually faces down Thrall himself and the players to try and recapture the Dragon Soul for his master, Deathwing.
    -   Warcraft also has Magatha Grimtotem. She is obviously evil from the very beginning and doesn't even TRY to hide it. By her race's standards, she's an old woman/cowlady. She's fairly harmless, until Cataclysm, where she kills tauren leader Cairne Bloodhoof in a rigged fight, threatens the players (who have fought gods and dragons and come out on top), and steals a Twilight's Hammer artifact.
    -   Kil'jaeden the Deciever, being over 20,000 years old and the leader of an army of demons bent on bending the universe to their will and corrupting everything. He doesn't entirely look the part, due to his race being immortal, but his good counterpart, Velen, definitely looks old. Kil'jaeden is probably still considered old by Eredar standards, but not Burning Legion standards.
-   Dermot "Lucky" Quinn in _Watch\_Dogs_ is The Don of the Chicago South Club. Not only does he wield considerable influence over the city but uses his favorable reputation to kill anyone who gets in his way including Aiden Pearce's niece and runs a human trafficking operation that sells kidnapped women from America and Europe to the highest bidder.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Fate/stay night_ has Zouken Matou, a twisted, vile piece of work hideous in both body and mind.
-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_:
    -   Manfred Von Karma, _the_ Amoral Attorney and a murderer, is around 60 years old.
    -   Ambassador Quercus Alba from the same series is another very nasty example.
    -   Damon Gant, murderer and blackmailer, is 65 years old, believe it or not.
    -   Though he's probably not nearly as evil as the above three, Blaise Debeste corrupt chief prosecutor, murderer, and Abusive Dad also counts at around Von Karma's age. He was also the Chief Prosecutor who gave Von Karma his first and only penalty, not because he forged evidence but because he got caught. Were it not for a literal meddling kid, he probably would have escaped the law.
    -   Aristotle Means from the fifth game, though Younger Than They Look (unless you consider 45 to be old), definitely at least looks the part. Means also combines this with Sadist Teacher when their true personality is revealed.
-   _Umineko: When They Cry_ has Ushiromiya Kinzo, who apparently set a twisted ritual to sacrifice his family in order to revive his deceased lover, Beatrice. It is later revealed this was not his doing, but he's still responsible for a lot of fucked up stuff, like keeping his daughter Beatrice II isolated from the outside world in a secret mansion and making her believe she was a reincarnated witch, raping said daughter and getting her pregnant, and constantly abusing his other children to the point of traumatizing them for life.
-   The very existence of this trope in regards to the work is something of a spoiler, but _Fleuret Blanc_ contains an example: The FOIL judges, who murder former members to collect their prized possessions.
-   The Big Bad of _Zero Time Dilemma_, Zero II/Brother/Q/Delta is _124 years_ old.

    Webcomics 

-   Douchenugget from _Coming To The Lavender_ looks like a 50 year old man and is an evil sadistic cultist who tortures and kills people for a living
-   Sarda from _8-Bit Theater_. Though in his case, it's not "Evil" as much as it is "Jackass".
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, the host Sirleck possesses for most of the comic was a very elderly man who is implied to have been quite corrupt even before he became an abberation's host.
-   Director Deena Daniels of B.E.N.T. from _Hexenringe_ definitely fits the bill of an evil old person. Her design is based on Mama Fratelli from _The Goonies_.
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ Fructose Riboflavin is an almost 2000-year old semi-humanoid moth creature, and he looks his age. He's also a revenge-crazed s.o.b.
-   Xykon from _The Order of the Stick_ wasn't always a lich. Before he transformed, he was already 80 years old, yet he was still a strong enough sorcerer to wipe out a squad of paladins without any of them touching him.
-   _Slightly Damned_: Dakos is a fire demon war veteran and is probably one of the nastier demons thus far, he has no real sense of loyalty or camaraderie and blames Talus's death on Lazuli for not following orders, terrorizes a captive angel child in front of its helpless family for kicks and and throws Kieri off a wagon to distract the semi-berserk Buwaro not knowing he doesn't actually intend to kill her.

    -   Fire Lord Sozin died at the age of 102 after many years of prosecuting a war against the other nations. He was already this trope when he started said war.
    -   Old Lady Hama is a waterbender who was captured and imprisoned by the Fire Nation and, along with dozens of others, kept locked in terrible conditions and away from water. She escaped when she realised that _blood_ is water and she could manipulate it at the peak of her powers during a full moon, allowing her to seize control of a living person's body, which she used on the guards to escape. But she was still stuck in the Fire Nation so she set up shop as a kindly old innkeeper... and at the full moon used her new technique, which she called bloodbending, on the ordinary and innocent Fire Nation neighbours in revenge for her treatment.
-   Old Man Jenkinsbot from _The Bagel and Becky Show_ is one of these as a robot.
-   _Big Hero 6: The Series_ has the aged supervillains Baron Von Steamer and Supersonic Sue, from the Rogues Gallery of the Old Superhero Boss Awesome (a.k.a. Fred's dad).
-   Colonel H. Stinkmeaner from _The Boondocks_ is well known for being a hateful and spiteful old man who, despite his age and blindness, keeps on going by The Power of Hate, living only for violence and generally making other people as miserable as humanly possible. He also employs the word 'nyukkah' in the same way most people might use the word 'you.' Stinkmeaner is _so_ evil, in fact, that when Granddad Freeman accidentally kills him, he goes to hell and _enjoys himself down there_ with the constant violence, blasphemy, and all things terrible. He goes so far as to call Satan a "bitch-ass nigga" _to his face_, which only impresses and pleases the embodiment of evil. He considers Hell substantially better than jail.
    -   There's also the Hateocracy, a Terrible Trio of fellow evil old folks Stinkmeaner met in a retirement home. The four were eventually evicted and began wandering the Earth, spreading misery and pain wherever they went, just For the Evulz. Shortly after Stinkmeaners death, they tracked down the Freemans for revenge except not really. Being sociopaths, the Hateocracy didn't actually care about Stinkmeaners death at all, it just gave them a target for their violence
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_:
    -   The Senior Citizen Squad, a trio of old people that from time to time fight the main group (one of them is Numbuh Two's grandmother).

    -   There's also Grandfather and his senior citizombies in _Operation: Z.E.R.O._.
-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_: Eustace is usually the epitome of an excessively unpleasant Grumpy Old Man, but sometimes he can be even _worse_ than a grumpy Jerkass and comes really close to this trope with his cruel treatment of Courage. This is especially notable in "Ball of Revenge" where he is flat-out evil.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Carter Pewterschmidt, Lois's father. He's a Corrupt Corporate Executive who indulges in robber baron behavior that would disgust Boss Tweed, was (and is) a terrible father and husband, and makes no secret of how much he hates his son-in-law Peter, harassing him at every opportunity.
    -   In one episode an old puppet maker Chris befriended turned out to be a Nazi Grandpa hiding in America under a fake name.
    -   Recurring character Herbert the Pervert would qualify due to him being a pedophile, but he's Played for Laughs due to his affable personality and him being far too old and decrepit to be of any real danger.
-   Mom from _Futurama_ is a prime example. Despite presenting herself as a loving, motherly figure, she hates everyone and everything, and has actually sent every robot in the world on a revolution against humans so that they could conquer the world for her.
-   _Invader Zim_: Ms. Bitters. True to her namesake, she's completely devoid of any compassionate emotion and possesses demonic hatred for all life on planet Earth. However, even SHE won't tell her students why Valentines gifts switched from cards and candy to meat products.
-   Señor Senior, Sr., of _Kim Possible_ is not so much evil as he is bored, taking up supervillainy as a hobby to keep him occupied during his retired years, and to have something to piss away his practically infinite amount of money on. For this reason he employs Contractual Genre Blindness, and doesn't even care whether he wins or loses, since he's just doing it for the sport.
    -   Nanny Nane.
-   _The Owl House_ has Terra Snapdragon, who has been head of the Plant Coven since Eda was a teenager about thirty years ago and is no better now than she was then. She brainwashes Raine or so she thinks, is quite willing to kill Kikimora if she doesn't double-cross Luz, and the only reason she doesn't harm Luz herself is because the Emperor wants her alive.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_:
    -   "Fallen Arches" involved The Ministry of Pain, a supervillain team that used to terrorize Townsville but are now mostly harmless because they've become old and feeble. They're still as evil as ever, though, and Blossom tells her sisters that they won't fight them because they're old. The Girls are forced to recruit the two retired superheroes Captain Righteous and Lefty who fought the Ministry back during WW2, with the entire group of old people ending up hospitalized from minor injuries because their elderly bodies couldn't handle the strain.
    -   Played with in "Criss Cross Crisis"; Professor Utonium invents a machine that turns apples into oranges, which results in everyone in Townsville swapping bodies with each other. Mojo Jojo winds up in the body of an old lady so he can take advantage of the confusion and trick the girls (who are in the bodies of the Professor, Mayor, and Miss Bellum) into fighting other "villains" (including a British man in the body of Fuzzy Lumpkins and a group of teenage girls in the bodies of the Gangrene Gang) while he commits crimes.
    -   The prequel movie also had one of the monkeys exposed to Chemical X by Mojo Jojo being an elderly primate who introduces himself as Pappy Wappy while weakly attempting to slap a human senior citizen.
-   Ed Bighead from _Rocko's Modern Life_, though middle aged, still counts. In the Episode: "Zanzibar" Rocko and the populace of O-Town had the courage to convince Conglom-O to turn against Ed Bighead and the evil he's done to the environment.
-   _Samurai Jack_: Aku is hundreds or even thousands of years old, and is a being powerful enough to conquer the galaxy.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Mr. Burns could qualify as the Trope Codifier for the comedic version. He's done every evil deed imaginable, from blotting out the sun to stealing candy from a baby, and that was just in one episode.
    -   Agnes Skinner isn't as blatantly evil as Burns, but she's still a nasty old woman, who treats Principal Skinner with condescension at best and open cruelty at worst.
    -   Vittorio DiMaggio, a wizened old man and The Don of the local Mafia, is _also_ less of a supervillain than Burnsie (and more pleasant than Agnes), but the fact remains he runs a criminal empire and is willing to kill people over small gambling debts.
-   In _Sonic Prime_, Dr. Done-It, one of the five counterparts of Dr. Eggman that comprise the Chaos Council, is visibly the eldest among them. In fact, he looks old enough to be the father of Mr. Dr. Eggman and Dr. Deep and the grandfather of Dr. Dont and Dr. Babble, if it wasn't explicitly mentioned that the five of them aren't related to each other.
-   Grampa Marsh once rallied the elderly residents of _South Park_ to conquer the town.
    -   Grandma Stotch is even worse. She bullies and physically abuses her own grandson.
-   Mad Mod from _Teen Titans (2003)_.
-   The Terror from _The Tick_, a 100+ year old supervillain who used to be buddies with Joseph Stalin. Played for Laughs as he's, putting it mildly, gone a little bit senile with age (until his reappearance in the show, his last public appearance was in the 70's when he tried to get his revenge on his arch-enemy Theodore Roosevelt by _punching out Mount Rushmore_).
    
    **Arthur:** Oh, come on. The guy's got to be, what, a hundred and fifteen?  
    **The Tick:** Evil, chum, is ever-green...
    
    -   Tick turns out to be completely correct, as the Terror turns out to be old and decreipt, but just as evil as ever, and returned to menace the main characters several times.
-   Mumm-Ra of _Thunder Cats_ and _Thunder Cats 2011_ appears both elderly and undead when he's powered down.
-   Female example- Nerissa, Big Bad from season 2 of _W.I.T.C.H._ is very old and looks even older due to her hard life and the rigors of her magic, and she's also a Knight Templar out to take over the universe as she thinks it's the only way to end all war and suffering. In the last third of the season she manages to get her youth back.
-   Granny May from _WordGirl_ is a devious thief and conwoman and on the very short list of WordGirl's genuinely competent enemies. She favors playing up her age and perceived helplessness as a way of gaining sympathy and manipulating others, going so far as to feign deafness to add to it.
