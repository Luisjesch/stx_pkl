"Butt-Head, I think I'm freaking out."

**Super Hans:** Jez, can you tell me, yeah? As a mate, someone who knows me really well; is the bottom half of me on fire?  
**Jeremy** ...No.  
**Super Hans:** Thanks. That's good.  
**Jeremy:** Are you tripping?  
**Super Hans:** The shit I'm seeing, I fucking well hope so.

Use of mind-altering substances distorts the world. Sometimes, the hallucinations are passed off as a side-effect of overconsumption of an otherwise legal and legitimate foodstuff such as sugar, ice cream, chocolate, or steak sauce.

What makes this trope generally different from Intoxication Ensues is the hallucinations. The narrative might jump back and forth between the hallucination and the real world to show they are holding a normal, intelligent conversation with a plant. Typically great comedic fodder with a believable setup. If it's animated, expect those affected to Open the Iris.

If it doesn't contain An Aesop about the dangers of drug abuse with, it tends to just show off a character's carelessness. May involve a G-Rated Drug. Hallucinations caused by alcohol go under the subtrope Pink Elephants. See Acid Reflux Nightmare for a food-related version. See Chemically-Induced Insanity for cases where the character is stealthily or forcibly dosed in order to cause derangement. This may be observed in tandem with Drugs Causing Slow-Motion. Sometimes leads to a Disney Acid Sequence. If it's a whole group of people experiencing it simultaneously, it's Everybody Must Get Stoned. See also Through the Eyes of Madness and Drunken Montage. Also often tied into Drugs Are Bad. Not to be confused with the Brazilian dance and music genre, Samba. Also not to be confused with an actual mushroom doing the samba (as is the case in _Undertale_).

Also not to be confused with Acid-Trip Dimension, where you're not _actually_ tripping, the environment just looks like you are.

This trope is usually subject to Artistic License – Pharmacology, as writers tend to wildly exaggerate the effects of psychedelic drugs such as shrooms and LSD. While they do produce visual distortions, they won't make you see anything like talking unicorns. Ego death (the loss of your sense of self, creating the feeling of being connected to the Universe) has a much bigger impact in a psychedelic drug trip than hallucinations, but is rarely portrayed in this trope.

At the end of the episode, the dealer tricks Ed into accepting a "very valuable" shipment of mushrooms that turn out to be ordinary edible Shiitake mushrooms that the dealer was going to dispose of anyway (although Ein's reaction to taking a bite indicates that there may be one or two of the "magic" variety mixed in with the regular ones). Hey, at least she succeeded in getting food!

As the characters contrive to feed each other fungus, various zany situations crop up due to the apparently behavioural-altering effects of common mushrooms.

    **Wallace:** Sorry, sir.
    
-   The _Superman_ storyline _The Fall of Metropolis_ sees Metropolis afflicted with a gas that causes hallucinations to anyone exposed to it.

-   In _Black Queen, Red King_, ordinary candy hearts<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  acts like a combination of weed and LSD for changelings. It also restores their sense of taste (much to their delight) and makes them involunarily secrete binding gel.
    -   Selene lampshades this with this line: “I don’t get it…”
-   In Discworld fics by A.A. Pessimal, the idea of Discworld shamanism is revisited. This is largely via the experiences of shamaness Xenia Galena, a young woman who combines the roles of Priestess and Witch to her nomadic horse-dwelling people. The great-grand-daughter of a Shamaness who once took Rincewind on an astral trip, Xenia is a competent Shaman. She knows, for instance, to take _only just enough_ of the necessary psychotropic drugs, and to keep her head relatively straight whilst Walking the Otherworlds.

-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Smurfnip Madness", the Smurfs have various types of hallucinations when they end up eating smurfberry cookies that are laced with smurfnip, such as Smurfette imagining herself seeing Vexy and Hackus from _The Smurfs 2_ as real characters. Gargamel and Azrael themselves become similarly affected when they breathe in the fumes of concentrated smurfnip, with Gargamel seeing his mother chasing after him with a handbag and Azrael a big bulldog.
-   In _Enlightenments_, Dormin gently convinces Wander to eat some psychotropic mushrooms to try and shake him out of his depression by giving him some new sensations to mull over.

He winds up on the roof of the building, with a stick as his lightsaber, totally naked, retelling Han and Leia about Bespin.There are also some defaced garden statues involved. Han stuns him with his blaster to get him out of there. Luke later vanishes and Mara Jade (in the era before she was his wife) finds him singing bad karaoke in a bar. She keeps him from wandering off again but he's also rather amorous while he's intoxicated. Oddly though, they do end up having an enjoyable encounter later, and want to get together again. She does make him promise not to eat anymore mushrooms though.

She thought it was medicine, but Fluttershy points out, "Oh no, that's my acid!" We don't get to see the bird's hallucinations, but she's high as a kite during the chase scene that immediately follows.
    -   That raises the question of why Fluttershy had acid in the first place... and "The Penny and Clyde Show" hints at the answer. When Discord's wave of chaos overtakes Ponyville, the other ponies become distraught, but Fluttershy just stands in the chocolate milk downpour, looks at the rabbits transforming into long-legged monstrosities, and remarks, "Oh, this is just a normal day for me."

-   In _Beavis and Butt-Head Do America_, Beavis eats some peyote for water and goes on a hallucinogenic trip seeing himself and Butt-Head as rotting zombies and freaky demons everywhere playing the guitar, driving mini cars, etc., set to some trippy music performed by Rob Zombie ("Ratfinks, Suicide Tanks and Cannibal Girls"). The scene was based on drawings of Rob Zombie's, the music was actually from Rob's now-defunct band White Zombie.
-   _Boogie_: After Boogie gets administered sedatives by Marcia, he gets a flashback to his Vietnam days, where he ends up in a Disneyland knockoff called "War Land", with a Tinkerbell parody blowing up a child with a grenade launcher, and the castle's spires turns into nuclear missiles. It's also filled with landmines, shooting range where Boogie gets to gun down theme park mascots with _real_ bullets, and a Splash Mountain parody where the water is replaced by _blood_.
-   In _The Dagger of Kamui_, the progatonist Jiro and his newly found mother eat soup and then break into unexplained hallucinations. It was later revealed the soup was laced with poison by a minion of the film's baddie.
-   One of the most classic Mushroom Samba scenes was in Disney's _Dumbo_, where Dumbo drinks from a tub of water laced with champagne, and has a wild and disturbing musical fantasy sequence about "Pink Elephants on Parade". That must've been _some_ champagne. In Real Life, zoopsia (the hallucination of animals, including Pink Elephants) is a symptom of sustained alcohol abuse. Although elephants are _terrible_ at holding their liquor. Most elephant-related fatalities are also alcohol-related. On the _elephant's_ part.
-   Happens literally in the movie _The Elm-Chanted Forest_ when the hero is captured by talking mushrooms, who proceed to do a whole song-and-dance routine about how awesome it is to be a mushroom. At the end of the routine, they all suddenly grow fangs. It's loosely implied that this is because of something they gave him to turn him into a mushroom himself.
-   Happens in _The Good Dinosaur_ to Arlo and Spot when they eat old fruit that fermented in the sun. Both giggle like they're high, Arlo grows extra eyes, they scamper around together each with the other's head on his body.

When he wakes up, he discovers that the "Hydra" he was fighting was actually _the entire town of Thebes_.
-   _Lucky Luke: Ballad of the Daltons_ has one after the Dalton brothers drink mushroom-laced water. They dream of being part of a Busby Berkeley Number (which could qualify as a Disney Acid Sequence), complete with a Spoofing in the Rain.
-   Alex the Lion from _Madagascar_ has a brief one after getting hit with a tranquillizer dart. Twice.
-   Heavily implied in _The Road to El Dorado_. While in the middle of singing "It's Tough to be a God", Miguel and Tulio smoke some cigars, and the song turns into a full-blown Disney Acid Sequence. They were also drinking "Punch" throughout the song, and getting weird looks on their faces after each drink.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Across the Universe (2007)_ uses this. It's also taken to a greater level with all the visual imagery used and the fact that the music is by The Beatles...
-   Most of _Altered States_ consists of Mushroom Sambas... but they are hardly unintentionally induced, as the main character who undergoes them is researching the very drug behind the phenomenon.
-   In _The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans_, in what is probably the film's best-known sequence, the protagonist snorts some heroin that he thought was cocaine, snorts some actual cocaine to try to balance it out, and ends up hallucinating about iguanas. Later on, after a climactic shootout, he orders that a dead man be shot again because "his soul is still dancing!", and the camera switches to his perspective to show that, yes, he is hallucinating the man's spirit break-dancing over his body.
-   The League of Shadows' blue flowers and Dr. Crane's fear gas/spray from _Batman Begins_ seem to qualify. Decidedly not played for laughs, and in fact is used as a panic-inducing plot point.
-   _The Bear:_ The eponymous bear cub finds some toadstools and, curious, eats some. He spends the next few minutes tripping out and whimpering, which is to be expected given what he sees.
-   In _Beverly Hills Ninja_, Haru, interrogating a source, uses a powder made from the "laughing mushroom" as a Truth Serum. However, he sneezes on it, he and love interest Sally Jones also inhale a dose, and the three sit around laughing their asses off at the most frightening and depressing truths.
-   _Billy Club (2013)_: One morning, Danny finds a bag of chocolates in the cabin and eats them all. After he takes off on a buggy, Alison informs everyone that Danny ate the chocolate-covered mushrooms she brought for them all to enjoy. Said mushrooms kick in while Danny is in the woods. First his vision gets all wavy, then the colours start to change.
-   When Jerry of _Conspiracy Theory_ is first captured by Dr. Jonas, his system is pumped full of LSD to make torturing him easier. His hallucinations and distorted perception of the world are notably played for drama rather than laughs.
-   Central plot device in the black comedy _Death at a Funeral_, whereby a pharmacology student creates an experimental designer drug and stores it in an empty Valium bottle. Throughout the movie Mushroom Sambas occur when the hallucinogenic pills are accidentally taken by three characters attending a funeral service. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Doctor Strange (2016)_:
    -   To prove that she did not drug him when she pushed Stephen's spirit out of his body, the Ancient One "opens \[his\] eye". What follows is Stephen (or his mind anyway) being flung across various dimensions in a manner that defies proper description. One could be forgiven if they thought she actually did spike his drink.
    -   Any scene in the Mirror Dimension is trippy as hell in the "dream-based real-world parody _Inception_\-style" kind of way.
-   _Dora and the Lost City of Gold_ has a scene where the protagonists get sprinkled with strange spores, and have a hallucination in the art style of the original Dora the Explorer TV show. Dora hallucinates all of her friends from the show, and the hallucination gives their adult guide the idea to strip naked and run through the field.
-   _Dracula vs. Frankenstein_: Julia experiences one after after she has her coffee drugged at the coffeehouse. However, the whole thing is quite PG-rated and looks more like an amateur interpretive dance routine.
-   _Empire Records_: Mark eats Eddie's "special brownies" and proceeds to hallucinate himself into GWAR's video for Saddam A Go-Go from the album This Toilet Earth, then getting eaten by the World Maggot (the same thing that ate Jerry Springer when GWAR was on his show). He seems to find all this very funny.
-   Oscar's drug trip in _Enter the Void_ which we see from his POV. It's probably one of the more realistic trips shown on film.
-   Subverted in _Euro Trip_ where two of the movie's protagonists, predictably, decide to visit an Amsterdam bakery/coffee shop and trip out on hash brownies. Jenny gets the munchies while Scott simply freaks out (including the random, memorable confession "I saw a gay porno once. I didn't know until halfway in. The girls never came. The girls never came!"). When it gets really intense, the chef informs them that they do not serve hash brownies, meaning that the only thing they were high on was the placebo effect.
    -   It doesn't help that the bakery was owned and operated by Jamaicans. Who claim the brownies are "magical."
-   In _Father's Day (2011)_ Twink and Father Sullivan find Ahab's (toxic) berries and eat them, setting off a hallucination sequence. They even feed some to the passed out Ahab.
-   _A Field in England_ features a twenty minute eye-bombing sanity-stripping example, with flash-cuts, mirror effects, swirly lenses, the works. Word of God states that a feature film normally has about six hundred cuts. This film has fifteen hundred cuts in _the fifth reel alone_.
-   In _Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare_, Spencer, played by Breckin Meyer, sees all kinds of trippy imagery coming out of the TV, set to Iron Butterfly's "In-a-gadda-da-vida", and ends up in a video game.
-   _The Gingerweed Man_: In the middle of the movie, The Gingerweed Man takes a hit from his bong, and then things get trippy. During the trip, Kaya the weed deity appears and tells him of how important Buddy is to the fate of the world, and that both he and Barbara were kidnapped.
-   In _Go_ Manny takes two hits of ecstacy and while in a grocery store starts hearing 'Macarena' and hallucinates that he is dancing with the checkout lady and they are feeding each other bananas.
-   _The Hunger Games_: When Katniss is stung by the poisonous Tracker Jackers. This is admittedly Lighter and Softer than the book's presentation of the events.
-   In _The Immortals_, the mortally-wounded Tim is left alone in the nightclub and takes some special tabs of acid he has been saving: presumably both to kill the pain and because this is probably his last opportunity. He starts tripping, and while doing so, thinks Billy is the Angel of Death and tries to shoot him.
-   Played straight in _Labyrinth_, Sarah is given a "present" from Jareth — a peach which either causes her to hallucinate or actually transports her to a masquerade ball inside a crystal. There's also a possibility that the whole Labyrinth and such were hallucinated by Sarah, possibly because of a magical owl.
-   In _Lethal Weapon 4_ Riggs, Murtaugh and Detective Butters are trying to get a Chinese mob boss to talk, so they sneak in on him while he's at the dentist and give him a snort of nitrous oxide. Unfortunately Butters leaves the inhaler on, so everyone in the room gets a little loopy, leading to the reveal that Butters has gotten Murtaugh's daughter pregnant.
-   In _The Mansion_, Charlotte suffers through this after eating some mushroom-laden cupcakes, and Patrice suffers it later in the film courtesy of a Toad Licking.
-   The Canadian film _Men with Brooms_ had a lead character whose father was a regular 'shroom user. There were plenty of jokes about it, though no explicit hallucinatory scenes onscreen.

-   _The Northman_: The rite of passage Amleth endures alongside his father begins with both consuming a potion prepared by Heimer called a "vision mead" which induces strange and trippy hallucinations while Amleth's will is tested.
-   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_: The effect of the lotus blossoms, apparently.
-   _Reefer Madness: The Musical_, with the pot brownie scene.
-   In _Revenge (2017)_, Jen takes a peyote bud as an anaesthetic to kill the pain while she conducts Self-Surgery. However, in the aftermath, she experiences a series of hallucinations, including a sequence where she seemingly wakes up only to be shot in the head by Michael, only to wake up again and have the sequence repeat.
-   In _Road Trip_ after Barry's grandpa eats some of E.L.'s pot brownies he hallucinates that his dog is talking to him:

-   In _Salvador,_ Doctor Rock (James Belushi) slips some LSD into an American TV journalist's cocktail. In the next scene she's talking to the camera, then suddenly sinks to the ground in a fit of laughter.
-   _Save Yourselves!_: While wandering through the woods with the baby, Su and Jack suddenly begin to hallucinate, seemingly a result of getting sprayed with some sort of gas by a pouffe earlier. The couple visualizes things such as bunches of baby bottles appearing in their hands, all while the screen acquires a blurry filter. They become too engrossed in their fantasy to notice the baby crawling away, and they're only able to recover when Su injects both of them with the epinephrine from their kit.
-   In _A Serious Man_, the protagonists son Danny becomes a Bar Mizvah stoned.
-   In _Shrooms_, the main characters all drink a tea brewed from hallucinogenic mushrooms so they can all experience a trip. As they wander through the woods, they all start hallucinating and get separated from one other. Things become worse as the hallucinations make it impossible for them to tell what is real and what is not while a Serial Killer seems to be stalking them.
-   _Smiley Face_: Jane is a habitual marijuana user even starting her day with a bong hit, but after eating her roommate's brownies, notices there is something wrong. They were pot brownies meant for the roommate and his large group of friends, and Jane had eaten them all. The rest of the movie is her trying to run her handful of errands for the day while disasterously high.
-   _Snow White & the Huntsman_: The Dark Forest is feared as a hellish landscape with monsters, vermin, Body Horror, etc. The Huntsman, one of the only people to enter the forest and return alive, explains that while the forest does have a few monsters in it and is treacherous, the real danger is the hallucinogenic spores.
-   _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_: Kirk tries explaining off Spock's alien behavior on 1986 Earth by saying that he suffered brain damage from too much "LDS" back in the sixties. The whale scientist doesn't buy it.
-   In _Suck_, Joey mistakes two ecstasy tablets for aspirin before going out on stage. The result: an aptly titled musical number "This Is Your Brain On Drugs" with distorted colors and visions of three vampire band members leering at Joey.
-   _Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny_ had JB eating mushrooms in a forest and going on an extended Dream Sequence in which he was the son of the Sasquatch. He ends up nearly drowning and falling off a tree.
    
    "Huh. This place is kinda.... _**JUICY**_."
    
-   In _The Tripper_, Samantha has no intention of taking any drugs at the festival, as the result of a previous bad trip. However, one of the other festival-goers sprays her with LSD, causing her to start hallucinating, which does not help when she is attempting to escape from the killer through the forest.
-   _The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent_ has a downplayed example. At one point, Javi convinces Nick to take some LSD with him for the sake of inspiration for their screenplay. There's nothing trippy, the two are just incredibly laid back for awhile, until they suddenly become very paranoid that people are following them, and they end up panicking and driving like crazy to get away.
-   In _Upstream Color_, a woman is hypnotized by a thief who tells her that his face is made from the same substance as the sun, so she cannot look directly at him. From her perspective, we see her flinch away from bright light coming from the thief's direction.
-   In 1996's _A Very Brady Sequel_, conman Trevor Thomas is served hallucinogenic mushrooms in a plate of spaghetti by clueless maid Alice; the subsequent sequence features animation (including dancing pandas and a helicopter-tailed wizard bird from the Filmation _The Brady Kids_ cartoon) and the trippy Sixties anthem "Good Morning, Starshine" from _Hair_.
-   In the 1996 film _William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet_, Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) is given an ecstasy pill right before going to the Capulet masked ball — putting Mercutio's "Queen Mab" speech in a different light altogether. Some seriously trippy imagery from his perspective ensues.
-   Theresa spends most of _Woodshock_ under the influence of a powerful cannabinoid, though the directors use editing techniques (e.g. double exposure, flashbacks, framerate manipulation) rather than out-and-out hallucinations to portray her state of mind.
-   _The World of Kanako_: The narrator goes through a heavy one after having been drugged by Kanako.
-   Used as a murder weapon in _Young Sherlock Holmes_. Namely, the effect of a sedative dart results in a priest seeing a glass knight on a painted window coming to life and chasing after him.

    Gamebooks 

-   In Book 4 of the _Lone Wolf_ series, _The Chasm of Doom_, while in the Maaken Mines, breathing the spores of Calacene mushrooms can cause the hero to hallucinate of a fiendish monster (or a whole swarm of them). The "fight" that ensue cause real damage, however, since Lone Wolf keeps throwing himself against the sharp rocks of the tunnel.

    Literature 

-   _1Q84_: Tengo has a rather odd drug induced hallucination after partaking in some hash with Nurse Kumi.
-   The opium dream in _The Alice Network_ involved talking lilies and curious distortions of space.
-   Jules Verne's _Around the Moon_ involves an incident where the group on the space capsule begins having bizarre arguments about the "moon people" (whose existence has only been speculated on with no evidence at all). It ends with each of them claiming to be the true leader of the moon. Then one of them realizes that someone left the Oxygen valve open and they've been getting high off pure O2 for hours.
-   _Bearheart_: Bigfoot takes drugs and falls in love with a statue at a park.
-   In _Bored of the Rings_, Frito eats some mushrooms and pills provided by whacked-out wayside hippie Tim Benzedrine and hallucinates until he passes out.
-   Soma is a regular cause of Mushroom Sambas in _Brave New World_.
-   The late-1960s Hugo-nominated novel _The Butterfly Kid_ by Chester Anderson involves a plot by pacifist aliens to take over the world by overdosing humanity with a drug that causes _solid, physical hallucinations that can be seen by people other than the one taking the drug._ The idea is that human beings will find this so confusing that they will be rendered helpless. This does not work; the humans are all hippy stoners who enjoy the experience, generating creative hallucinations.
-   _Cryoburn_ opens with this. "Angels were falling all over the place... _Ah, terrific. Auditory hallucinations, too._"
-   In _Dora Wilk Series_, after the main character is drugged so that she'd stop fighting, she has a darkly comical trippy sequence which would be funny if it wasn't for the fact that she's in the middle of a rite whose purpose is to plant a demon in her soul.
-   In _The Hour of the Dragon_, Conan the Barbarian sees Xaltotun using the black lotus.
    
    ''It was the pollen of the black lotus, which creates deathlike sleep and monstrous dreams; and he knew that only the grisly wizards of the Black Ring, which is the nadir of evil, voluntarily seek the scarlet nightmares of the black lotus, to revive their necromantic powers.'
    
-   _The Hunger Games_: A (mostly) extremely unfunny version thanks to Tracker Jacker venom.
-   _Illuminatus!_ involves many scenes where halluciogenics are used to induce a Mind Screw on the characters and the reader. At the finale at a German music festival, the drinking water supply has been laced to protect the festivalgoers from the oncoming psychic warfare by the Illuminati.
-   In _A Lion Among Men_, The Lion meets some bears who act like stoners. On Honey.
-   In George Alec Effinger's _Marîd Audran_ series, Bill the cab driver has had one of his lungs replaced with a container of a powerful hallucinogen, which continuously drips into his system. When he drives, he constantly swerves to avoid obstacles no one else can see, and holds conversations with the demons in the front seat of his cab.
-   _A (Not So) Simple Fetch Quest_: When Katie starts feeling sick from contaminated food, she knows she's likely to die and respawn soon, so she decides that she might as well test whether the nearby mushrooms are edible. When she awakens in the respawn chamber, she doesn't remember what happened, but she has gained 4 levels of Artistry, and judging by the state of the walls and of her previous body, she apparently finger-painted the walls with a monstrous spider's acid until her fingers dissolved down to nubs and dropped bones everywhere.
    
    Personally, I wouldn't call the... rather _phallic_ images that now decorated the cave walls 'art', but whatever.
    
-   _The Purple Pileus_ by H. G. Wells is a short story about a man whose crappy life is changed for the better after he trips out on some mushrooms he finds in a wood.
-   In _Small Gods_, Brutha meets a hermit, St. Ungulant, who lives in the desert, and occasionally eats mushrooms:
    
    **St. Ungulant:** The desert becomes really interesting after the mushroom season.  
    **Brutha:** Full of giant purple singing slugs? Talking pillars of flame? Exploding giraffes? That sort of thing?  
    **St. Ungulant:** Good heavens, yes. I don't know why. I think they're attracted by the mushrooms.
    
    -   In the first Discworld novels, _The Colour of Magic_ and _The Light Fantastic_, the idea of Discworld shamanism is introduced. This revolves around taking interesting hallucinogens and seeing where they take you, and which entities you're likely to meet while burbling and trying to stop the top of your head from unscrewing.
-   In _Steppenwolf_ by Hermann Hesse the suicidal protagonist is rescued from his lonesome misery by some friendly strangers and their charming cigarettes. They take him to their 'Magic Theatre'(Not For Everyone/For Madmen Only/Price Of Admittance Your Mind) and they indulge in many drugs and Harry spends the last third of the novel reveling in hallucinatory adventures. At the end of the novel he snaps out of it briefly and is told that he has been in the Magic Theatre the whole time and making rather a fool of himself, but it's okay and they give him another hit.
-   In _Tailchaser's Song_, Tailchaser accidentally gets High on Catnip and has a weird dream.
-   _Vainqueur The Dragon_: Victor isn't entirely clear on what he did after drinking the mushroom wine, but apparently it involved exchanging bites with an entire city of vampires, wrecking heaven's reputation, and discovering that the gods play dice with the universe. Various characters are in awe of him afterward.
    
    Why were his fingers starting to look like snakes?
    
-   Bloody Jack in _Viva Jacquelina!_ a starving Jacky discovers some mushrooms growing on some manure, with the predictable results (including seeing a White Rabbit and talking to Brer Frog). When she comes down, she picks up **more** of the mushrooms to experiment with **on other people**. Not What It Looks Like Ensues.
-   _Wings of Fire_:
    -   Moonwatcher from _Wings of Fire_: _Winter Turning_ warns her friends to not eat any colorful frogs in the rainforest. The reason? She once started having very weird dreams about newts and anteaters taking over the world after she ate one.
    -   The previous book has Kinkajou mention eating smokeberries given by Rain Wing healers while her injured wing was being treated. They also made her see some wacky hallucinations. Some examples are "flying panthers, quetzals the size of dragons, \[and\] scavengers with superpowers."

    Music 

-   The Black Angels: The song "I Hear Colors (Chromaesthesia)" is clearly from the perspective of someone tripping balls, with lyrics like: "I feel colors rushing through my veins / Making me invincible to pain / I can hear them everywhere / Screaming by and glowing bright"
-   Black Sabbath: The song "Fairies Wear Boots" from _Paranoid_ is at least in part about someone who's tripping on LSD and having weird and fantastical hallucinations. Although it was also implied to be a Take That! to some skinheads that one of the band had violently encountered.
-   Hector Berlioz's Symphonie Fantasique has a scene in which the protagonist takes a large dose of opium to kill himself, he gets the dose wrong and proceeds to dream of watching his own execution after killing his love interest.
-   Mitch Benn's "Tea Party" details the effects of various illicit substances administered (initially accidentally) to his unknowing aunty and uncle, with appropriate accompanying music for each new substance/verse.
-   "5:15" from _Quadrophenia_ documents the protagonist's drug-fueled train journey to Brighton.
-   The man on the chessboard get up and tell you where you go and you've just had some kind of mushroom and your mind is moving low...
    -   Go ask Alice, I think she'll know.
-   This song chronicles the adventures of an LSD-addled Captain Kirk.
-   "Picture yourself on a boat by a river...." Although John Lennon credibly Jossed the theory that the title of the song (which, for tropers living under a rock, is "**L**ucy in the **S**ky With **D**iamonds") is a drug reference (apparently, he liked the phrase, inspired by a drawing by his son Julian), there's little doubt that the actual lyrics have are inspired by Lennon's psychedelic experiences. (Marmalade skies? Kaleidoscope eyes? Rocking-horse people eating marshmallow pies? Plasticine porters with looking-glass ties?)
-   _Blonde on Blonde_ by Bob Dylan has "Rainy Day Women, #12 and 35," which is the Trope Namer for Everybody Must Get Stoned. Dylan allegedly said he could\`t record the opening track with sober people, so he fired up a round of joints... Thus, everyone on the take is stoned out of their mind, making the recording a _literal_ mushroom samba. The hysterical laughter in the background should be proof enough. _Everybody must get stoned_ indeed.
-   The music video for "_OD'd on Life Itself_" from _Imaginos II: Bombs Over Germany_ features Albert Bouchard taking "Imaginos 500mg" pills, which cause him to hallucinate himself as a puppet version of the rock opera's titular character.
-   One of the possible explanations for the plot to Job for a Cowboy's _Sun Eater_. If the protagonist isn't receiving visions from a bonafide seance, she's tripping balls on psychedelics (based on the nature of the visions and the album's flow itself, probably ayahuasca). "Worming Nightfall" is either where she gets trapped in a trip gone _very_ wrong (if you believe it's drug-related) or in a dream world (if you believe it's supernatural). The band has intentionally left it ambiguous enough that both explanations are entirely plausible.
-   "And She Was" by Talking Heads was reportedly inspired by a girl David Byrne knew in high school, who would describe her experiences with taking LSD in a field near a Yoo-Hoo bottling plant. It certainly explains the song's narrative of a girl lying in a vacant lot when she suddenly flies off over her hometown while feeling a oneness with the universe.

    Music Videos 

-   The music video for "Learn to Fly" by the Foo Fighters depicts the results of a drug stash being kept in the reservoir of the coffee machine on a commercial airplane that the band is riding in, and then that coffee machine being used to brew coffee for the entire place without noticing said stash. Everyone on the crew gets high, along with nearly all the passengers (except for Our Intrepid Heroes, who declined the coffee) start to hallucinate wildly. It is left to the band members to take the plane in for a safe landing.
-   An innocent children's song about gathering mushrooms in the countryside... or is it? Mangez-moi, mangez-moi, mangez-moi...
-   In Pepe Deluxé's "Go Supersonic" music video, three guys each drink a "supersonic"-sized Hot Sauce coffee. They then hallucinate a strange go-cart race.

    Roleplay 

-   James Brown of _Survival of the Fittest_ says hi, he'll get back to you right after the Boos stop chasing him (a.k.a. epic acid trip).
-   _We Are Our Avatars_: The Group ate some strange fish and had strange reactions for a while.

    Theatre 

-   In the second act of Cirque du Soleil's _Volta_, Mr. Wow has a hallucinogenic trip of being lost in a jungle after nibbling a flower, which leads into the Hair Suspension scene.

    Web Animation 

-   Lez of _The Big Lez Show_ goes through these frequently, but the longest one was the "flashback drug" sequence in Season Two.
-   Vegeta undergoes this in _Ducktalez 7_ after eating some special brownies and drinking some booze beforehand.
-   _FreedomToons_: Joe Rogan is consuming various drugs throughout the "Joe Rogan interviews Tim Pool & Jack Dorsey" cartoon. At the end, when he asks everyone if they've tried DMT, Joe himself is shown as a unicorn with a human face.
-   In the episode "Truth Seekers" of _Helluva Boss_, Blitzo and Moxxie are captured and held in a room that's filled with a Truth Serum gas. After some unintended and regretted Brutal Honesty at each other, they each go into a different hallucination where they confront their issues with other people, including each other. The scene shifts between the real world and each of their two hallucinations, with Moxxie's refined musical-style scene contrasting a bit comically with Blitzo's more straightforward scene, although Moxxie's refinement doesn't stop imaginary Blitzo from annoying him by saying a bunch of crude stuff. The aftereffect of these hallucinations is to make both of them a bit more open about their feelings and in their relationships.
-   In the second episode of _The Most Amazing Story Ever Told_, three stoners get high on mushroom pizza and start seeing things like faces coming from the palms of their hands and Satan himself visiting them.
-   _Supermarioglitchy4's Super Mario 64 Bloopers_
    -   The episode "99.5% Crazy" revolves around Mario getting high off a Poison Mushroom and staying that way for the whole blooper until he is cured by a random 1-Up Mushroom that crawls into him.
    -   Mario goes high from several more Poison Mushrooms (and even from an overdose of pills) over the course of the series, with one instance ("Yoshrooms") having Yoshi join him for the ride.
    -   "A Dose of Dr. Mario" has a scene where Dr. Mario cosumes one of his own Megavitamins, which makes him allucinate and later convulse.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Awful Hospital_, Fern gets dosed with an unidentified gas by the Hospital's anaesthesiologist, Anna. The comic's artstyle changes to rough sketches on lined paper, and Fern's perception shifts drastically. Of course, since the comic makes a theme of various different perceptions being equally valid, this translates into Fern suddenly knowing the solutions to all puzzles and the path to take to the conclusion of her current quest.
    
    **Fern:** WALLACE! EYESACK! I see everything! The layers! The paths! Jordache! _\[jumps on Isaac's back\]_ I know PRECISELY where to go!
    
-   In _Blue Milk Special_ Leia thought the Ewoks were one of these. Han didn't discount the idea, since they both _did_ share the 'weird cigarette' during the night before the Battle of Endor. (The Ewoks are real. And murderous. And possibly Xenomorphs.)
-   _Bob and George_: Mega Man goes on a trip after being attacked by Needle Man in which he encounters a spirit guide in the form of a yet to be created communist robot whom he proceeds to throw at the monstrous apparation of Needle Man in order to to defeat him. George later gets his own spirit guide in the form of X, when he finds himself hanging up in Wily's lab again and Wily dopes him to the eyebrows just to get him to shut up.
-   Ivy from _Bobwhite_ snacks on some chips whose label warns, "High in cholesterol. May cause vivid fever-dreams." She then hallucinates a visit from Bootsy Collins.
    -   Much later, getting lost and hungry on a fossil-digging trip causes Marlene to hear the voice of Alfred Hitchcock from her fern fossil. On the very next page, Ivy's spirit guide shows up, in the form of a fish wearing Bootsy Collins' glasses.
-   In _Champions of Far'aus_, Skye and Karla accidentally ingest a strange liquid that makes them see hypnolytic spirits as floating cat and lizard heads respectively while they are checking the House of Insanity.
-   The blue mushrooms of _College Roomies from Hell!!!_ have this effect. Merely touching them can cause you to see tiny windows on them, with Smurfs inside.
-   Subverted in Jin Wicked's _Crap I Drew on My Lunch Break_:
    
    "But this is just herbal tea..."  
    "I know, I just wanted to draw all this cool stuff."
    
-   _El Goonish Shive_: Supposedly, Grace and her catnip.
-   _Girl Genius_ has a gas concoction that Master Payne's Circus of Adventure cooked up that they use to extricate Agatha and themselves from a brutal fight with Wulfenbach forces, simply by spreading it around and yelling "The Heterodyne Boys are here!"
    -   Not to mention the effects of drinking coffee brewed by a Spark-created machine.
-   _Homestuck_ has Act 6: Act 5: Act 2, in which Jane licks a giant magical lollipop, turns into a technicolor, creepily smiling version of herself. She then proceeds to turn all her friends into smiling technicolor versions (However, Dirk isn't affected, despite him turning technicolor), form a sex cult, dance around a poorly rendered JPEG Christmas Tree to the sound of Jingle Bells as played on bicycle horns interspersed by random sound effects, forge legendary garishly colored artifacts, and then flood the world with garishly colored fancy porcelain Santa figurines. Even the _narrator_ compares the magical lollipop to drugs.
-   In one _Lackadaisy_ standalone comic, Rocky tricks Mordecai into drinking his special "space coffee", which apparently allows the drinker to peer into a Lovecraftian nether-dimension. Mordecai is absolutely horrified (one of the few times he shows genuine human emotion). There is absolutely no indication of what Rocky put in the coffee to achieve this effect.
-   Liquid Snake and Decoy Octopus of _The Last Days of Foxhound_ decided to try some of Vulcan Raven's "medicine" to see if they can see the future... this happens.
-   _Nodwick_ has a strip where the evil undead anti-paladin Count Repugsive ends up tripping on too much cough syrup. Don't ask us why the undead need to drink cold syrup.
    -   It's because of their coffin.
-   Tai from _Questionable Content_ apparently enjoys LSD from time to time. At work.
-   Whenever Sandusky or Kashmir do catnip in _Sandusky_.
-   In _Scary Go Round_, Shelley gets high on berry jam at the Tackleford Fair.
-   _What Birds Know_ uses this metaphorically, if not literally (it's somewhat ambiguous in the story itself), when the female protagonists enter an Alternate Universe where they experience bizarre hallucinations and... lay golden eggs.

    Web Original 

-   In the Third Night of _The Tale Of Gaven Morren_, Gaven is dosed with Elisdee Lily extract. Given that everything is out to get him already, and you can see how not being able to tell what's a hallucination from reality might be a problem. The hallucinations manifest as frequent daydream surprises, the inability to recognize himself in mirrors, and even hallucinating the presence of an entire character.
-   As seen on Texts From Last Night:
    
    **(828):** I can't remember where my feet are. All I can see are colors, and all I can feel is terror. The lollipop was a bad idea.

    Real Life 

-   Truth in Television, possibly: Some scholars of Greek literature believe that the Ancient Greek Oracles obtained their visions and heard the voices of the gods because they inhaled steam from natural geothermal vents for hours every day.
-   Certain groups of people who are around even to this day owe their mythologies and legends to such experiences since they believed certain plants and substances had spiritual powers which could be tapped by eating or smoking them.
-   The hallucinogenic properties of lysergic acid diethylamide (better known as LSD or acid) were discovered by accident by research chemist Albert Hoffman when he unknowingly ingested some that he came in contact with. Hoffman realized that he had made a significant discovery, and so three days later he deliberately took 250 micrograms of the drug, which he estimated would be a minuscule threshold dose. He was wrong — the actual threshold is one tenth of that amount. Dr. Hoffman spent several hours terrified that he was possessed by a demon, that his next-door neighbour was a witch, and that that his furniture was threatening him, before relaxing into pleasant hallucinations of kaleidoscopic images in which every sound he heard became visible.
-   Dock Ellis pitched a no-hitter on June 12, 1970 for the Pittsburgh Pirates while under the influence of LSD. He later spoke of the whole event for _No No: A Dockumentary_, to which this video skillfully animates.
-   Ergot, a fungus which grows on some types of grain during wet winters... and is apparently not destroyed when baked into bread along with the rye, can have hallucinogenic effects (along with gangrene and/or dying). Ergot contains ergotamine, a precursor to LSD. Some scholars believe that those who testified at the infamous Salem Witch Trials and similar events in Europe as having witnessed "witchcraft" and the Devil, had in fact been the result of a combination of religious fervor (i.e. they already believed demons and witches were everywhere)... and hallucinating due to eating ergot-infected rye bread. It should be noted that Albert Hoffman was in fact researching ergot when he discovered LSD.
    -   Ergotism is also suspected to be the cause of the dancing plague, a series of accidental medieval raves.
    -   This could also be the reason madness was believed to be infectious in medieval days due to an ergot infestation in a town's bread supply.
    -   It has been seriously suggested that St. John of Patmos, who lived as a hermit, could have unwittingly ingested lots of ergot in his bread. The last book of The Bible does read like a bad acid trip.
-   Bill Hicks frequently talked about taking mushrooms in his stand-up routines, and referred to their effects as "squeegeeing his third eye".
-   In Christopher Titus's special "Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding," he describes himself as being on this while hopped up on painkillers while also extremely hungover after going to a doctor to treat his hands after he fell hands-first into a bonfire.
-   Psychopharmacology posits that hallucinogenic substance predates history, which is supported by its common prevalence among existing tribal societies today. These tribes also use them for religious/revelatory applications, and some of more radical psychopharmacologists (such as Terrance McKenna) "theorize" that our evolution into higher order thinkers was due to revelation brought on by hallucinatory and psychoactive substances (see the "Stoned Ape" theory).
-   This can even happen without drugs, namely with high fever and sleep deprivation. And epilepsy. And comas. And semi-regular, nightly unconsciousness.
    -   Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are where people have various sorts of hallucinations (most commonly seeing spiders) while falling asleep or waking up, respectively.
-   In the 1970s, cops raiding an LSD factory in Wales failed to take into account that it had been making the stuff in large quantities for some time. The carpets, curtains, easy chairs etc. contained a significant quantity of spilled powder. They conducted a thorough search. Enough said...
-   Both the British and American armies have experimented with LSD.
-   The CIA experimented heavily with LSD during the Cold War, including the infamous MKULTRA mind control research. It got to the point where getting secretly dosed was a routine part of life as an agent.
-   Steve-O from Jackass once said his worst trip was on Magic Mushrooms.
