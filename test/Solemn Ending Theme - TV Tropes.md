_This is my cheesy song for an RPG  
Artistically invalid, but it rhymes sufficiently  
And now it modulates to D  
because it is the saddest of keys  
To denote the tragic romance  
That ended so predictably_

An emotional, solemn, usually slow-paced song played during the credits. Common especially in anime and video games.

The most common type is a pensive, retrospective or sad Anime Theme Song, but it can be an instrumental tune as well. Since except in some cases the soundtrack usually supports the temper of the ending, this is often a sign of a bittersweet or Downer Ending. May also appear for a show's Grand Finale (with or without special Finale Credits). You may expect this to be accompanied by a Credits Montage.

In shows with a Wrap-Up Song, the final number may be a slower and sadder version of the main theme. In these cases, the "sorrow" of having to say goodbye to the viewers is mostly comic exaggeration (and they're careful to mention that they'll be back again tomorrow).

This trope is used often differently in anime, where the opening theme is usually more exciting in order to build excitement for the coming show while the closing theme is more somber to provide a resting period or moment of reflection between shows.

Tropes and styles commonly found in a Solemn Ending Theme:

-   Ethereal Choir
-   Japanese Pop Music
-   Lonely Piano Piece
-   One-Woman Wail
-   Playing the Heart Strings

Preferably provide links to the song (Youtube or otherwise) when adding examples. Take care, linked credits videos might obviously contain ending spoilers; to prevent this, it would be optimal to link the song without the credits video or mark credits videos as such.

Sister trope to Album Closure.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Tiger Mask_ was the Ur-Example, which, according to _The Tō-Ō Nippō Press_, "changed Japanese anime music".
-   _Wolf's Rain_, "Gravity". Sung in English by Maaya Sakamoto. (non-spoileriffic credits video)
-   _Cowboy Bebop_ has "The Real Folk Blues" as the answer to the intro theme "TANK!". The series as a whole also has "Blue".
-   _Outlaw Star_ features this for the first 13 episodes, and a slightly less solemn one for the rest of the series. Yes, both far more somber than the opening theme.
-   _Baccano!_, "Calling". Extremely noticeable in contrast to the jazzy upbeat opening, "Guns & Roses".
-   The 3rd season of _Sailor Moon_ featured this in the original Japanese, it was changed to an instrumental version of the US opening credit song when it ran in syndication on Cartoon Network.
-   _Gasaraki_ features one.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ features Frank Sinatra's "Fly Me to the Moon" sang by several different female vocalists, each with her own unique voice style.
-   _Excel♡Saga_ ends with a parody of this, where Menchi laments her role as the emergency food source, while a woman translates her howls. The last episode parodies the parody with Menchi and the translator's roles reversed.
-   _The Big O_'s ending theme _And Forever..._
-   The ending theme of _Queen Millennia_. True, the title theme isn't exactly Hard Rock either, but the ending seems to be a bit more solemn. More pronounced in the film version where the ending theme (different from the TV series) is sung by Dara Sadaka.
-   _Future War 198X_: "Pathetic Love is My Destiny" by Kazuko Kawashima. Only in the original Japanese version. The Macekered dubs replace it with a song by Asia.
-   In comparison to the more Hot-Blooded opening theme and first and third endings, "Tsubasa Aru Mono," the second ending song from _Saint Beast: Kouin Jojishi Tenshi Tan_, is very subdued and gentle.
-   _Berserk_'s 1997 anime adaptation has "Waiting So Long", a song that manages to be both endearingly corny with its Gratuitous English, and genuinely haunting.
-   _Berserk (2016)_: _Meimoku no Kanata_ (_Beyond Closed Eyes_) by Nagi Yanagi is the ending theme which is more slow and melancholy compared to the fiery opening _Inferno_, and focuses on the solace that Guts seeks for the bad dreams and emotional wounds he carries with him.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_ has another foreign-language ending theme, this time in Italian: the bleak, operatic "Dopo il Sogno".
-   _Higurashi_'s first ending Why or Why Not. It even comes with a Next Episode preview that FITS with the end of the song!
-   _Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin_ has "A Far Off Distance" by Galneryus.
-   _A Little Snow Fairy Sugar_ has "Snow Flower".
-   Most episodes of _Black Lagoon_ end with the incredibly dark and somber "Don't Look Behind" by EDISON.
    -   The Hansel & Gretel arc ends with the no-less solemn World of Midnight.
-   _Guin Saga_ has "This is my Road," sung by Kanon Wakeshima and composed by Nobuo Uematsu.
-   _Mushishi_ has a different one for every episode.
-   The Ending Theme for _The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya_, Yasashii Boukyaku (Which translates as "Tender Oblivion") doesn't even feature any instruments (although there is a version with them) focusing entirely on the solitary loneliness portrayed by Yuki Nagato.
-   _Mekakucity Actors_ has _days_ as its ED, accompanied by a long take of Hiyori sitting alone on the train, with the main cast slowly appearing around her. After Episode 4, the final shot - of Hiyori alone again - becomes quite the Tear Jerker, as she's just died.
-   The original release of the _Mobile Suit Gundam_ compilation movies had the Enka style song "Cross of Sand" by Takajin Yashiki. The second movie had an unnamed Ethereal Choir number amongst the stars. The third movie ended with Lala Sun's theme ("Beginning") by Daisuke Inoue. The George Lucas Altered Version, however, replaces these second and third movie ending songs with the more fast paced Inoue song "Soldiers of Sorrow" (relocated from the final battle scene) and the more upbeat sounding "Encounters" also by Inoue. Fortunately, "Cross of Sand" was left alone in the first movie.
-   _Robotech: Love Live Alive_ had the usual opening with the majestic Ulpio Minucci theme. The closing credits, surprisingly, were accompanied by the song "Only a Fool" by Gigi Agrama. This song was actually taken from the 1986 _Robotech The Movie: The Untold Story_ which few have seen outside of bootleg. But they may recognize it from the 1995 _Robotech_ 10th Anniversary soundtrack double CD collection.
-   _Blue Drop_ has _reversed_ this for its anime; the show starts with the slow, contemplative "Blue", and ends with the upbeat "Tsumoboshi", both performed by Suara.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ somewhat did this with "And I'm Home" (Sayaka and Kyouko's character song) and "Mata Ashita" ("See You Tomorrow"; Madoka's character song), added to the disk sets for the 9th and the first 2 episodes, respectively. Both are considerably more sappy and emotional than the dark rock ending for most of the episodes. But the clearest example is "Hikari Furu," the slow, dramatic, string-filled ending of the second Compilation Movie.
-   _Nabari no Ou_ has the quite depressing "Aru ga Mama" as its second ending theme.
-   While the regular ending theme of _Gungrave_ is an upbeat Akaneiro ga Moeru Toki, during the Finale Credits, the slow, bittersweet tune Happy Ending plays instead.
-   _Last Exile_ has the catchy electronica "Cloud Age Symphony" to open the show with. For closing credit it uses a nostalgia reel along with shots of Alvis and the more reflective score "Over The Sky" (which has a One-Woman Wail to its middle).
-   The second ending theme for Season 2 of _Assassination Classroom_ has "Mata Kimi ni Aeru no Hi" (Until the Day I See You Again).
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_ has "Freesia" by Uru.
-   _Zombieland Saga_ has "Hikari e" by Franchouchou, a bittersweet song about the main characters saying goodbye to their former lives in order to start new ones.
-   _Another_ has "Anamnesis," a melancholy ending theme, in contrast to the dark and intense opening theme.
-   _Angel Beats!_ has "Brave Song," a rather sad song about someone who leads a lonely existence, as its ending song. The last episode instead uses "Ichiban no Takaramono," a rather bittersweet song, for its ending.
-   Zigzagged for _Kotoura-san_'s ending theme _Flower of Hope_, owing to the series using Heal the Cutie as the theme. It starts off gloomy and solemn, fitting the series' Downer Beginning where the heroine is progressively broken, but it gets progressively brighter after the first stanza, corresponding to her recovery.
-   _Elfen Lied_ inverts this, with the opening "Lilium" being one of the saddest opening theme ever composed to an anime, and the ending "Be Your Girl" being a very uplifting pop rock song.

    Fan Works 

-   The epilogue of _Danganronpa: Paradise Lost_ is set to Hanatan's cover of HeavenzP's already rather bittersweet-sounding "Planetarium".

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Emperor's New Groove_ has its' credits play the very solemn, sentimental "My Funny Friend and Me" by Sting. This is a leftover from when the film was originally going to be a more traditional, grand Disney animated musical, before it was eventually turned into the zany buddy comedy it's known as today. It's a bit jarring coming after the bombastic, energetic final note of Kuzco's theme that plays over the "The End" card.
-   _Hercules_ transitions to the powerful, but emotional cover of "Go the Distance" by Michael Bolton to emphasize the scope of Hercules' journey to becoming a true hero.
-   _Pooh's Grand Adventure_ has a rock ballad cover of the film's song "Wherever You Are" play. It fits considering the film is a Darker and Edgier story for the _Pooh_ franchise and has a Bittersweet Ending perfect for a cover that adds onto the song's already tearjerking qualities with some uplifting power ballad material.

    Films — Live Action 

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Blackadder_: Fittingly, examples of this happen in the Downer Ending of both the first and (especially) the fourth season (the other two did not have enough of an emotional impact to warrant any change in the credits). The first ends with a solemn child's angelic voice singing lyrics more serious than the usual credits song and the fourth has no credits at all and ends with a mournful reprise of the theme and a fadeout to some poppies.
-   _The Book of Pooh_ has a sad sounding song at the end of each episode in which Winnie the Pooh and his friends bid goodbye to the viewer(s) and assure them that there will be more "adventures on the way."
-   _UFO (1970)_ has a fast upbeat opening theme but closes with an ominous atmospheric piece.
-   _Game of Thrones_, especially after important characters kick the bucket. The credits music at the end of "Baelor" is particularly sad, and "The Rains of Castamere" has _no ending credits music at all,_ due to the shock and tragedy of the Red Wedding.
-   The ending theme of _The Incredible Hulk (1977)_, "The Lonely Man".
-   _Kamen Rider BLACK_: "Long Long Ago 20th Century"
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: The end-credit song at the end of episode 8x01 is called _Where the Shadows Lie_. The song is the poem Tolkien wrote about the rings, being performed by Fiona Apple in a ominous, hopeless manner.
-   _The Mickey Mouse Club_. "Now it's time to say goodbye to all our company..."
-   Friday episodes of _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_ from 1971-72 closed with the solemn-sounding "Weekend Song".
    -   A part of this song would also serve as the coda to the closing version of "It's Such A Good Feeling" used since 1972, but the solemn effect was less pronounced because the preceding portion was upbeat, and the tempo picked up again for the instrumental as Mister Rogers said his closing words.
-   Used on the final episode of _Monty Python's Flying Circus_, in which an acoustic guitarist played the _Liberty Bell March_. It sounded like a brand-new guitarist was playing it, slightly halting and unsure. Strangely, it _works_.
-   Parodied by the version of the _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ "Love Theme" that plays over the show's closing credits, which is a much slower, more ponderous instrumental version of the theme sung over the opening credits.
-   _The Sweeney_ has a fast-paced opening theme as befits an action-packed cop show, but the closing titles use a surprisingly low-key arrangement of the same theme.
-   Archaeology show _Time Team_ has a slower ending theme without its usual drumbeats that it uses on "special" shows where they may be investigating things like WW2 archaeology or other sites that had a significant death count.
-   _Tutti Frutti_ episode 5 ended with a character's suicide. In place of the usual closing credits theme, Tutti Frutti by Little Richard, this episode ended with a lone guitar playing a haunting instrumental version of Love Hurts (a song that had been a recurring theme through the episode), while the credits appeared in red on a stark black screen instead of their usual multicoloured appearance.
-   Most episodes of _Once Upon a Time_ end with a quiet and almost haunting sounding piano tune.
-   _Jeopardy!_:
    -   The final episode of the Art Fleming edition in 1975 ended with Charlie Chaplin's "Smile" from _Modern Times_ playing over a now-darkened set.
    -   The final episode Alex Trebek taped before his death ended with a montage of memorable moments in his tenure, accompanied by Hugh Jackman's rendition of "Once Before I Go" from _The Boy From Oz_.
-   The final scene of the Grand Finale of _Breaking Bad_ is set to "Baby Blue" by Badfinger. It plays just as Walter dies.
-   In the last episode of _The Terror_, a reprise of "The Silver Swan", which was sung after the death of one of the characters earlier in the series, plays with the credits.
    
    Farewell, all joys; Oh death, come close mine eyes;
    
    More geese than swans now live, more fools than wise.
    
-   This trope was quite popular in Australia throughout the 1980s and 90s, being regularly used in many of their classic dramas, some of which include _The Sullivans_, _Sons and Daughters_, _A Country Practice_ and _Home and Away_.
-   _The Mandalorian_ had a solemn ending theme for Chapter 7: "The Reckoning", symbolizing the Darkest Hour nature of the episode.
-   The final episode of _The Colbert Report_ ends with Neutral Milk Hotel's "Holland, 1945", as a tribute to Stephen Colbert's father and two of his brothers, who were killed in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 in 1974.
-   _Jejak Suara Adzan_ uses Rizky Febian and Aisyah Aziz' "Indah Pada Waktunya", a solemn song about someone longing and waiting for another, somewhat fitting for a show about a son traveling far away from his mother to find his long-lost brother.
-   _Walker, Texas Ranger_: "A Rose in December", featured in the two-part Tragic Aids Story, "Lucas", is played during the end credits. Also qualifies as a Melancholy Musical Number all through the story.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   When Mick Foley first appeared as "Mankind" in the WWF, he had two themes, an entrance theme and a different, more solemn exit theme that played when he won a match.

    Radio 

-   The primary phase of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1978)_ ends with a recording of Louis Armstrong's "What A Wonderful World."
-   While most episodes of _Adventures in Odyssey_ end with a reprise of their signature upbeat theme-tune, episodes that either deal with serious subject matter or are just considerably darker (if not both) than the usual episode end with a slower and more solemn version of the usual theme. "Mortal Coil", "Blaackgard's Revenge" are couple of examples of this.

    Video Games 

-   Both endings of _Corpse Party D2: Depths of Despair_ are set to "Tada Hitotsu no Monogatari" by Artery Vein.
-   _Last Scenario_ ends with "Moji no dengon" by Sound Horizon.
-   "Drift" by Laura Shigihara is a slow and wistful song that plays during the credits at the end of _Quintessence_. \[credits video, non-spoiler\]
-   _Iji_ ends with a cover of the VNV Nation song "Further."
-   Many _Final Fantasy_ games end with one of these.
-   _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_ has "I am the Wind".
-   Inverted for the dog ending of _Silent Hill 2_. The starting theme is melancholy, then the game ends with an upbeat J-pop anthem followed by a cheery "singing dog". The normal endings are played straight, however.
-   _ICO_ has "You Were There".
-   _Shadow of the Colossus_ has "Those Who Remain".
-   _Metal Gear Solid_ features a Gaelic one. Almost all the _Metal Gear_ ending songs are like this, with the exception of "Can't Say Goodbye To Yesterday" and the one to the original _Metal Gear_ (which was ridiculously peppy). "Way To Fall" by Starsailor in _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ is a mournful alt-rock ballad, _"The Best Is Yet To Come"_ is a Gaelic ballad and _"Calling To The Night"_, _"Here's To You"_ and to a slightly lesser extent _"Heaven's Divide"_ are all super-melodramatic Power Ballads.
-   _Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne_ has "Late Goodbye," a melancholic, country-inspired tune implying a never-ending Stern Chase, as its Award-Bait Song end credits music, and Recurring Riff. The song became a Breakaway Pop Hit, launching the career of Finnish Alternative Rock band Poets of the Fall.
-   _Max Payne 3_ has Tears by Health.
-   _Turn Based Battle_ parodies this with "Cheesy RPG Song", which name-checks several other examples from this list.
-   _Wild ARMs_ series:
-   _Legend of Legaia_ uses this trope. See for yourself..
-   "Small of Two Pieces", the Narm Charm\-loaded Power Ballad that caps off _Xenogears_, might not be solemn enough to qualify for this trope, but the "Myth remix" likely is.
-   _Tetris Attack_/_Panel de Pon_, a game with a very upbeat soundtrack, ends on "A Walk on a Rainbow".
-   _Chrono Cross_ ends with the exquisite ballad "Radical Dreamers ~ The Jewel Unstolen".
-   _Radiant Historia_ ends with \-HISTORIA-, with its mellow instrumentals and retrospective, vague, sad lyrics (spoiler, but won't make much sense for anyone who hasn't played the game).
-   _Mega Man Zero 4's_ Freesia.
-   _Dark Souls_ has the Nameless Song., a haunting, beautiful One-Woman Wail.
-   _Killer7's_ Dissociative Identity
-   _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3_ has an ending theme that is a mixture of hard rock, Playing the Heart Strings, and Ominous Russian Chanting. And since Japanese, Soviet, and even Allies' endings can be considered The Bad Guy Wins kind of ending, it can be seen as rather appropriate.
-   The _Mass Effect_ Trilogy concludes with An end, once and for all a melancholic yet progressively more bombastic reprise of the last episode main theme.
-   The second episode from the _Arc the Lad_ series ends with To Tomorrow.
-   _Umineko: When They Cry_ has two: Bring the Fate from Ep 1 and Ricordando Il Passato from Ep 8 (it also counts as the ending theme for the series). Ricordando Il Passato is especially noteworthy because the lyrics is basically Battler grieving and lamenting over that he wasn't able to solve the mystery and understand Beatrice/Yasu until it was too late.
-   _Journey (2012)_ has "I Was Born for This."
-   _Halo_:
-   _Fallout: New Vegas_ has Playing the Heart Strings credits music.
-   _Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow_'s ending theme has a Dead Can Dance\-style wordless vocals, sung by Azam Ali.
-   _The World Ends with You_ features "A Lullaby For You" playing over the credits.
-   _DoDonPachi SaiDaiOuJou_ has Heading for Tomorrow performed by Zwei.
-   I Believe, which plays in the end credits of _Wolfenstein: The New Order_.
-   _Dragon Age II_ ends with a remix of Florence + the Machine's "I'm Not Calling You a Liar".
-   Some of the _Touhou Project_ ending themes, such as "An Eternity that is More Transient than Scarlet" from _The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil_, and "Sylphid Dream" from _Mountain of Faith_.
-   "In a Moment's Time" is this for _Skullgirls_
-   _The Legend of Spyro_ has This Broken Soul.
-   Ending of the Starry Sky from _Silhouette Mirage_.
-   _OFF_ uses Judy Garland's "Over the Rainbow" from _The Wizard of Oz_ as its ending theme.
-   _Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island_, of all games, ends with a slow, beautiful piano piece.
-   _Super Mario Galaxy_:
-   Period from _Deathsmiles_.
-   _Ori and the Blind Forest_'s end titles music, though upbeat, is accompanied by a heartwrenching One-Woman Wail vocal.
-   _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3_'s end titles.
-   _Time Crisis_: _Razing Storm_ has Five Finger Death Punch's "The Bleeding".
-   The end credits for _Darius Gaiden_.
-   _DuckTales: Remastered_'s credits use a melancholy piano arrangement of the Moon theme.
-   _Splatoon_ has these to contrast its otherwise usually upbeat, quirky, and raucous soundtrack, with the singers being (in-universe) whatever idol group has been your Mission Control:
-   _Evil Zone_ has "Sorrow Long Day".
-   _Dynasty Warriors 3_ has Circuit, a slow and reflective song about the singer opening a hidden side of themself up to someone close. Dynasty Warriors 8 also uses the song for the hypothetical endings.
-   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ has "The Edge Of Dawn," which plays for the credits on every route besides Crimson Flower. The song is implied to be from the perspective of Edelgard, who dies in three out of four routes, and looks back on happier times with a mix of nostalgia and regret.
-   The games in the _The Tale of ALLTYNEX_ trilogy all follow this trope to various extents with _RefleX_ following it the straightest with a one-two punch with the tracks "The End of Reflection" and "An Unavoidable Choice -End Roll Version-" playing back to back just to hammer it in just how bitter the ending the whole conflict ended up being. Sure, the Zodiac machines where destroyed and the alien invaders repelled, but at what cost?
-   While the mainline _Danganronpa_ series has had peppy and high-octane ending themes, the Fan Game _Danganronpa Another_'s credits sequence is set to the more morose "I believe" by KOKIA.
-   _Ikaruga_ has "Spirit Being", a funerary reprise of the game's main theme, during its end credits.

    Web Original 

-   Sad Panda's 'Flight of Fantasy' at the end of _Suburban Knights_.

    Western Animation 

-   At the end of the first episode of Seaon 8 of _Dragons: The Nine Realms_, Jun breaks up with Tom as a result of the latter breaking a promise. The sad music which played during the break-up scene continues playing as the credits roll.
-   The ending for the _Linus the Lionhearted_ show (1964) was like a funeral dirge. All the characters were sadly placing their props in a trunk, ending with Billie Bird sweeping up the spotlight afterwards.
-   _The Porky Pig Show_ ending starts off sadly but perks up when they say they'll be back next week.
-   Likewise, _Matty's Funday Funnies_ had its end theme start out a slow and sad verse, but then perks up for the rest of the song.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   "Mother Simpson" ends with a sad orchestral piece rather than the usual Simpsons credits theme as Homer sitting alone on the boot of his car for hours, well into the night. At that time, Fox started ending shows with split-screen credits with ads for Fox shows playing over it. The Simpsons staff had to fight tooth-and-nail to have the full studio credits play over that beautiful shot — and they got it.
    -   "The Homer They Fall" ends with the emotional "People" accompanying images of Moe aiding people in need around the world.
-   While not quite the end credits, leading to Mood Whiplash when the actual credits do come on, the two season finales of _The Trap Door_ conclude with a piece of instrumental music that would not sound out of place at a funeral. Listen here.
